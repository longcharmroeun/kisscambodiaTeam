This is Blue Silver Plant.

21
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,300
It’s a century soul ring.

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,840
No wonder even the Blue Silver Plant
has such a big change.

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,020
Can you tell me...

24
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,180
which soul beast you hunted to get this soul ring?

25
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
Datura Snake.

26
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,340
Welcome to the team of soul masters.

27
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,770
From now on,

28
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,350
you’re an honored soul master of Tian Dou Empire.

Brothers.

30
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,290
Our new worker claims he can forge.

31
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,520
Could this be...

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,680
the Skill of Random Hammering?

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,310
The most powerful continuous hammering skill.

34
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,470
Dad, I’m back.

35
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,300
I’m useless. I can’t help you.

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
You have to choose your path.

37
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,570

Little San should be home by now.

40
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,460
Please come in.

41
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,480
Hello, Grandmaster.

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,610
You are...

43
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,700
We haven’t seen each other
for about 20 years, right?

44
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,150
I can’t blame you for not recognizing
my current appearance.

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,180
I’m Tang Hao.

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,140
Tang Hao?

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,730
You...

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,400
You’re Hao Tian...

49
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,990
Let’s not mention the past designation.

50
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,840
Seems like I was right.

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
You’re Little San’s father.

52
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,070
He went home. Why are you here?

53
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,070
Exactly because he’s home, that’s why I came here.

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,900
I know you took him as your disciple.

55
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,840
I should have come earlier.

56
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,500
I have to go. He’s my only worry.

57
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,290
So I wish to entrust Little San to you.

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,950
You’re leaving? To where?

59
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,070
Leave?

60
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,010
No. I’ve decided to come back.

61
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,640
There’s something that I have to do.

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,430
He’s your son. How can you just leave him?

63
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,960
He’s your disciple..

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,240
I know you’ll take good care of him.

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,190
He won’t be happy with me.

66
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,430
He should make his own choice in his life.

67
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,540
Even if it’s an unusual path.

68
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,820
I believe in him.

69
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,690
I don’t know what happened to you.

70
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,950
But I can tell Little San can’t bear to be parted with you.

71
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,950
Don’t you think it’s cruel to him,

72
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,270
if you just leave him?

73
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,460
Being with me is crueler to him.

74
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,730
Okay, that’s all I want to say.

75
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,310
No matter what, please remember that he’s my son.

76
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,310
Xiao Wu, thank you.

77
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,670
What for?

78
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,720
Thank you for accompanying me.

79
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,870
Don’t be upset. Your father left temporarily.

80
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,620
You’ll see each other eventually.

81
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,340
Maybe he left...

82
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,530
so you can grow better...

83
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,690
and be stronger.

84
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,060
If you keep being like this,

85
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,790
aren’t you letting him down?

86
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,270
Perhaps.

87
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,840
But why did he just leave like that?

88
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,150
My father is my only family.

89
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,560
Without him, home is no longer home.

90
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,880
Even without your father,
you have me as your friend.

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,860
If you really want a family,

92
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,900
I don’t mind being your older sister.

93
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,710
Call me Sister Wu.

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,510
Everyone calls me that, except you.

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,460
I think you’re a few months younger than me.

96
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,120
If you’re willing to be
my younger sister, I’m fine with it.

97
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,540
Dream on.

98
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,000
I only want to be the older one, never the younger.

99
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,520
Xiao Wu, come to the mountain with me.
I want to show you something.

100
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,320
Xiao Wu, here’s where I used to practice martial art.

101
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,100
Let me ask you a question.

102
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,420
I hope you can answer me seriously.

103
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,890
Do you know?

104
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,020
Now you look like those old men in the school.

105
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,660
Xiao Wu, are you willing to be my younger sister?

106
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,930
I really hope that I have a family.

107
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,440
I...

108
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,880
I’m just a peasant.

109
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,980
I can give you neither wealth nor power.

110
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,850
But I can give you my promise.

111
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,140
I’ll protect my younger sister forever.

112
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,750
I won’t let her get hurt.

113
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,130
If one day, many people want to kill me,

114
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,840
but you can’t defeat them, what would you do?

115
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,740
They’ll have to kill me first.

Thank you, younger sister.

119
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,040
Can I not call you older brother?

120
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,480
Why?

121
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,260
I’m the boss of all the students
in Nuoding School after all.

122
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,480
What would they think about me when they
find out I have an older brother?

123
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,460
Okay, you may keep calling me Little San.

124
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,800
As long as I know you’re my younger sister.

125
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,790
This is for you.

126
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,210
What’s that?

127
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,660
Sleeve arrow. It’s also known as silent arrow.

128
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,680
When you pull the trigger,

129
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,380
the small arrows inside will
be launched under your control.

130
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,500
The sound of launching is soft.

131
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,280
It’s barely noticeable.

132
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,590
Why haven’t I seen you using this...

133
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,770
when we fought each other?

134
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,000
Silly girl. How could I use
such a dangerous weapon against you?

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,070
Then I should thank you.

136
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,780
Look, there’s a mosquito.

137
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,010
I can hit its left wing, without killing it.

138
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,190
Do you believe it?

139
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,870
Are you kidding me?

140
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,920
This is a hidden weapon.
Even my father doesn’t know about it.

141
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,150
I want to tell you that...

142
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,430
I have the capability to protect
my younger sister.

143
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,370
It looks fun. Can you teach me?

144
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,440
No.

145
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,260
Brother, teach me, please.

146
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,220
With your violent behavior,
if you learned this, many will suffer.

147
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,230
You should first learn
how to use the sleeve arrow.

148
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,010
It’s also a type of hidden weapons.

149
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,530
Hm, ungenerous.

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,420
I don’t know what’s the Grandmaster thinking.

162
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,700
There are several intermediate schools
that want to recruit us unconditionally.

163
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
However, he kept asking you to enroll....

164
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,170
in Shrek School, which has no rank at all.

165
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,690
My master told me to enroll here, not you.

166
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,470
Who told you to come along?

167
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,530
Fortunately, Barak Kingdom
is border to Fassnor Province.

168
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,000

Such a heartless one.

171

I did this for you,

172
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,310
because you’re my brother.

173
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,790
Since the exam is 2 days,

174
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,640
you have to play with me in Suo Tuo City for 2 days,

175
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,370
to make up for the trauma of my tiny soul.

176
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,600
The boss of Nuoding School has a tiny soul?

177

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,080
What about here? Rose Hotel.

180
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,620
Up to you.

181
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,270
Please get two rooms for us.

182
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm really sorry, we only have one room left here.

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,550
Yes only one left.

184
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,550
The Rose Suite.

185
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,950
Then one is fine.

186
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,750
Didn’t we always live in a dorm when we were in Nuoding City?

187
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,550
Okay, please get this room for me.

188
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,790
Okay, please get this room for me.

189
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,950
Wait a moment.

190
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,670
This room should belong to me, right?

191
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,290
Are you new?

192
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,020
You are...

193
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,060
I want to see your manager.

194
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Buddy, I think we came first.

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
So what?

196
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,810
Nothing. We just want you to get out.

197
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,780
Alright then.

198
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,510
How dare you talk to me like that?

199
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,740
I think you’re soul masters as well.

200
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,100
Come on, the two of you.

201
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,430
I’ll give you a chance to get me out.

202
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,220
Or...

203
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,760
you may show me how to get out.

204
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,060
Mr. Dai, calm down.

205
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,690
Manager Wang, you are getting better in business.

206
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,330
Mr. Dai, don’t say that.

207
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,900
The new staff doesn’t know the rules.

208
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,870
I’m sorry.

209
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,300
I’m sorry.

210
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,510
The room is reserved by Mr. Dai.

211
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,210
Please go to another hotel.

212
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,910
We’re not giving in. So what?

213
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,120
You snob who looked down at us.

214
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,640
Don’t you think we can be bullied
just because we’re young.

215
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,440
Even if you want to give in, I wouldn’t let you.

216
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,330
Mr. Dai, you...

217
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,490
My guests, please apologize to Mr. Dai. Or else...

218
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,720
Stop the nonsense. I’ll pay for all the loss.

219
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,870
Let me do this.

220
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,440
Why? I’ll do this myself. I want to hit him hard.

221
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,590
I’ve said I would protect you forever.

222
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,020
Stop fighting. As I said,
you two can fight me together.

223
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,070
Be careful.

224
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,020
Please.

225
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,220
[Next Episode]
You’re qualified to be my component.

226
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,500
So fast.

227
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,600
That’s too soon.

228
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
Those who break into Tang Clan...

229
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,380
will be killed.
