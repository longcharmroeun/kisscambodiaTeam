20
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,140
[Previous Episode] It’s important
to understand the nature

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,690
and prescription of these herbs.

22
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,690
Dugu Bo, where’s Tang San?

23
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,050
How dare you challenge me?

24
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,370
Sun Moon Golden Shine!

25
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,190
There’s even a trinity Martial Soul Fusion Skill?

26
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,610
Too bad, you’re still too weak.

27
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,830
Break!

28
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,190
Yes, we might not worth to be your opponent.

29
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,210
However, do you dare to offend our tribe?

30
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,610
[Soul Land]
[Episode 50]

31
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,810
Even if I can’t defeat the dragon from your tribe,

32
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,790
but if I kill all of you,

33
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,290
your family won’t have any proof to accuse me.

34
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,770
It’s just a piece of cake for me
to get rid of your bodies.

35
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,210
You’re right.

36
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,510
But Frander has nothing to do with our tribe.

37
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,510
It’s fine if you kill us,

38
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,450
can you spare his life?

39
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,410
Even if he goes alone

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,830
and tells about us to the tribe,

41
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,830
they might not believe him either.

42
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,610
Er Long, what are you talking about?

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,550
Am I a coward?

44
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,070
Just cut the talk and kill me.

45
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,770
I still want to be the matchmaker
for you both, when I was in the underground.

46
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,130
What’s wrong if the Golden Iron Triangle
dies together?

47
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,530
Frander, are you out of your mind?

48
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,050
Hurry and leave,
it’s not the time to show off.

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,870
I’ve lived more than half of my life,

50
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,530
it’s fine even if I die now.

51
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,130
Er Long, even though you have no feelings for me,

52
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,430
but in my heart, you’re as important
as how important Xiao Gang means to you.

53
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,710
To me,

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,950
I have no regret if I can die with you both.

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,850
But Little San will be left alone.

56
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,530
Dugu Bo, I don’t mind letting you know it.

57
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,930
You can’t afford to offend Little San’s father.

58
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,300
If we’re not back today,
my men will look for him.

59
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,630
He’s even more powerful than
the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe.

60
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,970
Oh, where does he come from then?

61
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,170
People whom I can’t afford to offend,

62
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,990
there’s only few in this world.

63
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,610
Now I’m curious, who’s his father?

64
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,950
Someone with the surname Tang,
and you can’t afford to offend,

65
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,130
who else on this land can he be?

66
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:44,230
Tang San. That man is also Tang, could it be...

67
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,590
That’s impossible.

68
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,170
His Martial Soul is only Blue Silver Plant.

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,450
That’s right, what you see
is only Blue Silver Plant.

70
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,290
What if he has two Martial Souls?

71
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,090
What? Twin Martial Souls?

72
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,290
You’re right.

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,810
<i>If that so,</i>

74
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,490
<i>the safest thing to do now
is to kill the three of them</i>

75
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,830
<i>and go back to check if Tang San is dead.</i>

76
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,130
<i>In case he’s still alive, I should kill him too.</i>

77
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,090
<i>That person, indeed I can’t afford to offend him.</i>

78
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,630
<i>But as long as remove the traces leave here,</i>

79
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,510
<i>it won’t be easy for him to find me.</i>

80
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,170
How dare you, Dugu Bo!

81
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,450
Little San?

82
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,230
<i>Of course, I do. What can you do to me?</i>

83
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,030
<i>Purple Demon Eye. Ghostly Trace.</i>

84
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,570
Soul bone of Eight Spiders.

85
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,830
Little San, you’re alright?

86
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,390
Don’t worry, Master. I’m fine.

87
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,870
<i>His attached soul bone has changed.</i>

88
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,210
<i>Just right, I can kill them all and save my trip.</i>

89
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,310
Senior Dugu,

90
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,030
didn’t you promise to do three things for me?

91
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,950
Alright, from now on,

92
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,810
you’ll never hurt anyone related to Shrek School.

93
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,370
Sorry to make you worried, Master.

94
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,510
Actually, Senior Dugu means no harm
for taking me here.

95
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,290
He realized my talent

96
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,010
and wished to teach me something
about Poison Martial Soul.

97
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,910
Why did you start a fight with him?

98
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,010
He said he had killed you.

99
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,830
He was just kidding.

100
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,830
With his nobleness and high status,

101
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,850
why would he kill me as I’m unknown?

102
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,590
Oh, Senior Dugu.

103
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,510
You wanted to tell me about
your granddaughter’s poison, right?

104
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,530
I think there’re still ways
to cure her poison.

105
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,010
I’ll discuss with you later on, alright?

106
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,350
<i>He has already found a way
to cure my granddaughter’s poison?</i>

107
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,690
<i>Well, since you’re still alive,
I’ll let you all go for now.</i>

108
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,810
Great.

109
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,250
Your disciple is quite extraordinary.

110
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,670
Frankly speaking, I would like him
to be my successor.

111
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,630
Normally, I don’t need to explain myself.

112
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,930
But I’m going to do it once today,
just for this kid.

113
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,390
I just wanted to figure out

114
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,730
whether you’re qualified to be his teachers.

115
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,930
You did well.

116
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,070
Master, you may go back first.

117
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,070
I wish to learn from Senior Dugu for a while.

118
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,650
What do you think?

119
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,990
Well...

120
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,630
What? Worried about him?

121
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,650
Or you’re afraid that I might steal your disciple?

122
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,450
Don’t worry.

123
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,450
Since you all are qualified,

124
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,190
I won’t take him from you.

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,490
It’ll take not more than a year,

126
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,890
and I promise he’ll be back to you safe and sound.

127
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,970
I, Grand Venom Master, mean my words.

128
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,690
Since you said so,

129
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,350
whatever happened just now
was just a misunderstanding.

130
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,890
I apologize for being repulsive.

131
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,510
It’s his honor that Little San can learn from you.

132
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,550
Take this medicine and you won’t
be affected by my poison formation.

133
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,830
Alright then. We shall be leaving now.

134
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,330
We’ll come and visit you another day.

135
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,110
The brighter the color is,
the more poisonous it’ll be.

136
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,690
Kid, what have you eaten?

137
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,790
Don’t blame me for not telling you

138
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,810
the herbs here are more powerful
than the normal ones outside.

139
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,490
With a potion,

140
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,950
it might cause death too.

141
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,470
Old Freak, you’re worried about me?

142
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,210
Don’t you always want me to die?

143
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:19,610
That’s right. If you fail my test, I’ll still kill you.

144
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,550
Old Freak, you just promised my teachers

145
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,130
that I would be back to them safe and sound.

146
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,270
Indeed.

147
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,990
But I can keep a corpse safe too.

148
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,630
You!

149
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,910
Xiao Gang, do you think Dugu Bo
is willing to teach Little San?

150
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,610
There must be a problem.

151
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,130
Dugu Bo seemed afraid of Little San.

152
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,810
But, no matter what,

153
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,370
Little San should be safe for now.

154
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,270
Or else Dugu Bo wouldn’t easily let us go.

155
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,190
Especially when he already knew Little San’s identity.

156
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,650
He would ask for trouble
if he still dares to hurt him.

157
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,550
Let’s hope so.

158
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,310
[Soul Land]

159
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,770
Time’s up.

160
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,710
Are you ready for my test?

161
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,750
Bring it on.

162
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,510
Are you sure?

163
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,650
Old Freak, the venom from
Jade Phosphor Serpent is nothing to me.

164
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,150
Forget it.

165
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,810
Hurry up and move on to the second test.

166
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,290
Second test.

167
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,130
Let it try a bite that bleeds.

168
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,030
You’re really evil.

169
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,930
<i>This is the Bamboo Emerald,
the best from the Trimeresurus family.</i>

170
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,290
<i>Once poisoned by it,</i>

171
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,570
<i>in less than three hours,
one will turn into pus and die.</i>

172
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,370
<i>Its body is even harder than steel,
so basically nothing can harm it.</i>

173
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,530
<i>The Fragrant Silk Woven Flower
can only block poison from outside.</i>

174
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,750
<i>Once the poison enters the blood,
the flower is useless towards it.</i>

175
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,150
Are you afraid?

176
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,650
Bring it on.

177
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,270
But, Senior Dugu,

178
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,050
if it bites me and I’m fine,

179
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,510
can you give this Bamboo Emerald to me?

180
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,050
I think you’re a Little Freak too.

181
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,290
Alright, I promise you.

182
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,610
Kid, if you know this Bamboo Emerald,

183
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,830
don’t you know its poison?

184
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:45,510
<i>Forget it, if I don’t cure him now,
he’s going to lose his life.</i>

185
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,290
<i>What?</i>

186
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,110
That’s right, Senior Dugu.

187
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,810
Do you think I’ve passed

188
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,310
your second test?

189
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,390
Also, this Bamboo Emerald belongs to me now.

190
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,750
Wait.

191
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,710
Kid, how did you do that?

192
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,030
Senior Dugu,

193
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,430
let’s finish the third test first.

194
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,730
<i>You’re really something.</i>

195
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,530
Tang San, think it over.

196
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,990
Even I myself can’t control the next poison.

197
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,830
You can still back out now before it’s too late.

198
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,950
<i>Dugu Bo’s body is soaked with poison</i>

199
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,430
<i>of the level of Jade Phosphor Serpent King.</i>

200
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,770
<i>It’s indeed difficult to block it
in my situation now.</i>

201
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,550
<i>No, as a disciple in Tang Clan,
if I can’t handle the poison,</i>

202
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,950
<i>I don’t deserve to be in the clan.</i>

203
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,630
<i>Let’s try the pollen of
the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower.</i>

204
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,110
Bring it on.

205
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,610
Are you sure?

206
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,150
<i>Even though the pollen can’t
block the poison in my body,</i>

207
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,690
<i>it’s still able to slow down the attack.</i>

208
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,070
<i>With the Octa Dark Frost
and Fiery Soft Apricot in my body,</i>

209
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,810
<i>as long as I use the Xuan Tian Strike
to enhance my blood circulation,</i>

210
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,370
<i>it’ll stimulate the drug effect.</i>

211
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,650
<i>Why am I doing this to him?</i>

212
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,190
<i>If he dies here,</i>

213
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,130
<i>it’ll be really troublesome.</i>

214
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,590
<i>Wait.</i>

215
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,370
<i>Hao Tian Hammer?</i>

216
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,130
<i>Both his Martial Soul and attached soul bone</i>

217
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,630
<i>have changed after he came here.</i>

218
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,370
<i>He must have eaten something.</i>

219
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,430
<i>Luckily, Dugu Bo doesn’t plan to kill me,</i>

220
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,710
<i>he only cast a small amount of poison.</i>

221
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,010
Thank you for having mercy on me.

222
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,230
What herb have you eaten here?

223
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,750
You can even block the poison
of the Jade Phosphor Serpent King.

224
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,370
After you brought me here yesterday,

225
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,750
I thought about it again and again,

226
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,590
so I consumed the Octa Dark Frost
and Fiery Soft Apricot.

227
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,450
What’s that?

228
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,430
Those are the poisonous plant
at both sides of the water spring

229
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,910
which grow by absorbing the Yin and Yang auras.

230
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,110
Those two are edible?

231
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,330
That’s right. Both are highly poisonous plants,

232
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,170
if any ordinary person is ten meters near them,

233
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,730
they would be frozen or turned into ashes
in less than three hours.

234
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,550
Don’t even mention about eating them.

235
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,030
But, since both fire and ice restrict each other,

236
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,690
when these two extreme herbs
are consumed together,

237
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,310
they’ll neutralize and reduce the toxicity.

238
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,810
That’s also the only chance to consume them.

239
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,230
After consuming them,

240
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,030
I used some special ways to absorb the herbs,

241
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,390
so I’m immune to your poison.

242
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,730
Great. Immune, you say?

243
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,390
That was how you cured the three poison just now?

244
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,890
Sort of.

245
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,790
<i>The herb effects must have not
been fully absorbed by this kid.</i>

246
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,650
<i>If I drink his blood, maybe...</i>

247
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,890
Old Freak, after you brought me here,

248
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,990
I finally know why you’re still alive
as you’re soaked with poison.

249
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,630
It’s because of the Ice Fire Mouth Spring, but...

250
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,930
But what?

251
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,290
the reason I ate the Fiery Soft Apricot
and Octa Dark Frost

252
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,410
is not just that simple.

253
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,590
It’s to make sure I can survive in this place.

254
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,710
When these two herbs are combined,

255
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,850
it’s equivalent to a mini
Ice and Fire Mouth Spring.

256
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,290
I have two ways to cure the poison in your body.

257
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,250
Either you eat these two herbs simultaneously,

258
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,650
then use your enormous soul power
to absorb the herbs,

259
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,130
but at the same time,

260
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,290
your poison power will also be neutralized.

261
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,950
Are you willing to do so?

262
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,100
[Next Episode]

263
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,210
This Old Freak is going to fall into my trap.

264
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,830
He does not dare to put a test
on his poison abilities.

265
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,870
As long as you don’t play tricks,

266
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,750
Alright, Little Freak. Let’s wait and see.

267
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,490
Brother.

268
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,370
I can guarantee even if you’re hit by it,

269
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,510
you’ll not stay alive within three breaths.

270
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,990
Look carefully.

271
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,190
This...
