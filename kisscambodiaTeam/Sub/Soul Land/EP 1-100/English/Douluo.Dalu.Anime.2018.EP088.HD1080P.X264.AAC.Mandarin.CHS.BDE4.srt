[Previous Episode]

24
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,120
I’ve grabbed it, so others don’t
have to keep thinking about it.

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,360
Tang San.

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,980
We’re fighting Lei Ting School today.

27
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,460
The only match they lost

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,600
was the one against Shen Feng School.

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Shrek, wins!

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,400
In order to defeat them,

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
you must have faith in your partners.

32
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,140
- Fourth soul skill, God Locking Ring.
- She escaped Lei Ting’s attack just now.

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,240
She hasn’t experienced
the power of lightning.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 88]

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,380
We surrender.

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,080
Ninth round, Lei Ting School won.

37
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,520
Cool. Let’s do this in the next round.

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,660
Xiao Wu.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,940
Let’s go.

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Mu Bai, it’s your turn.

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,440
Boss Dai, count on you now.

42
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,800
Shrek School is sending the captain.

43
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,060
A Soul Sect at Level 44
of Storm Attack Branch, Dai Mu Bai.

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,000
<i>The strength of Shrek School’s
captain is powerful.</i>

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,900
<i>I’ve depleted much energy in the last round.</i>

46
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,560
<i>I must settle this quickly.</i>

47
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,620
The situation is exciting.
Who will take the first move?

48
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,820
Tenth round, begins.

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,880
Fourth soul skill, God Locking Ring.

50
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,420
First soul skill, White Tiger Shield.

51
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,360
Using first soul skill to
resist my fourth soul skill?

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,940
You’re belittling me.

53
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,820
<i>Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum.
Unbreakable and resilient.</i>

54
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
It’s so stunning.

55
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,120
Dai Mu Bai has defeated his opponent
with just one soul skill.

56
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,720
Tenth round, Shrek School won.

57
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Teacher.

58
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Don’t be reckless.

59
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,280
Don’t stop me. I want to report that

60
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,940
Shrek School has attempted a murder.

61
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,320
They were battling just now.
Lei Dong didn’t surrender either.

62
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,900
Dai Mu Bai has only hit him off the stage.

63
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,340
He didn’t intend to kill.

64
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,260
The judge will not disqualify them.

65
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,600
But

66
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,860
Lei Dong’s shoulders are nearly broken.

67
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,860
With such a heavy injury,
let alone the qualifying rounds,

68
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,100
he won’t even be able to join the finals.

69
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,560
How can we just take this insult?

70
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,140
Let me fight them.

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,740
Shrek School is at their climax point.

72
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,960
If Lei Ting School loses one more participant,

73
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,740
Shrek School will have the final victory.

74
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,860
Are you okay?

75
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,860
However,

76
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,200
this person will be representing
Lei Ting School next,

77
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,320
Captain Yu Tian Xin.

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,520
A Soul Sect at Level 43 of Storm Attack Branch.

79
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,580
His Martial Soul is
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

80
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,060
Why did the weather change so suddenly? Xiao Gang.

81
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,380
<i>Tian Xin?</i>

82
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,620
Dai Mu Bai, you have to pay for what you’ve done.

83
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,900
We shall see if you can do that.

84
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,120
The ultimate battle between two captains.

85
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,640
Who’ll have the victory?

86
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,420
Begin!

87
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,940
I’ll show you today,

88
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,420
who has the strongest beast soul.

89
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,020
I would like to see it too.

90
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,060
It’s finally here. Rain.

91
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,100
Did you bring an umbrella?

92
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,620
Rain can conduct electricity.
Mu Bai is in trouble.

93
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:53,680
Wind and rain come as clouds cover the sun.
Dragon in heaven. Jade Lightning.

94
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,940
Remember, the dragon is the strongest.

95
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,780
I don’t agree with you.

96
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:31,830
[Soul Land]

97
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,380
<i>My strength is similar to my cousin Tian Heng’s.</i>

98
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,180
<i>Only because he’s younger than me,
the family values him more.</i>

99
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,140
<i>I have to defeat you in this match,</i>

100
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,260
<i>to prove to my family that I’m the best heir.</i>

101
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,820
<i>I left home to Tian Dou Empire,</i>

102
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,060
<i>to Shrek School,</i>

103
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,060
<i>so I can make myself stronger.</i>

104
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,120
<i>I can’t lose.</i>

105
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,500
Second soul skill,
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

106
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Mu Bai and Tian Xin have similar strengths.

107
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,040
They have the same style,
and even the same ambition.

108
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,120
That means...

109
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
What does that mean?

110
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,240
It won’t take long until the result is clear.

111
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,180
Come on. We’ll decide who wins.

112
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,500
The person who last stands will be the winner.

113
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,740
Okay.

114
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Fourth soul skill,
Blue Lightning Divine Dragon.

115
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,460
Fourth soul skill,
White Tiger Meteor Strike.

116
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,280
Fourth skill.

117
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,260
Both parties are using their fourth soul skills.

118
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,420
This is the last decisive strike.

119
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,060
No gimmick, only a battle between strengths.

120
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,560
This is a battle of equal strengths.

121
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,300
No matter victory or failure,
they’ve both tried their best.

122
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,460
He will win.

123
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
You’re very strong. I lost.

124
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,960
No, you didn’t lose. You might have lost the battle,

125
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,880
but your heart wasn’t defeated by mine.

126
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,500
Looking forward to the next strike with you.

127
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,280
Alright.

128
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,000
Qualifying match between
Shrek School and Lei Ting School.

129
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,020
Shrek School won.

130
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,980
Boss Dai.

131
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,500
Mu Bai.

132
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,540
Zhu Qing, did you come
to Tian Dou Empire to monitor me?

133
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,380
I promise, I’ll never court other girls anymore.

134
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,400
You wouldn’t dare. Let me tell you.

135
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
If you aren’t strong enough
to reach my expectation,

136
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,820
I will not marry you in the future.

137
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,940
You’ve agreed on the engagement?

138
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,780
Zhu Qing.

139
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,220
Mu Bai.

140
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,560
You two...

141
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,100
Little San.

142
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,180
Master.

143
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,440
The opponent that we drew surrendered just now.

144
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
We have only one opponent left.

145
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
Shen Feng School.

146
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,540
That’s right.

147
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,780
Tang San.

148
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,360
What’s the matter?

149
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,260
Our opponent tomorrow has surrendered.

150
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,420
When both our teams cross swords,

151
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,280
I’ll be the first one to fight.

152
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,720
I hope you’ll be the first one as well.

153
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,860
Oh.

154
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,980
Let us decide who the champion
of the qualifying rounds is.

155
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,280
If I lose, Shen Feng School will surrender.

156
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,820
Sorry, I can’t agree.

157
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,920
Why?

158
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,560
Could you be afraid?

159
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,520
We’re a team.

160
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,500
I can’t make the decision
for my teammates with my own will.

161
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,320
Tang San, don’t be a sissy.

162
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,180
I just want to fight with you fairly.

163
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,960
Just like the battle between
Dai Mu Bai and Yu Tian Xin today.

164
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,260
Little San, agree with him.

165
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,240
Give him a battle of men.

166
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,540
If I’m right, you’re doing this for Huo Wu, right?

167
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,000
However...

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,840
If that’s the case, we’ll decide
the victory with one match.

169
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,380
Don’t have regret in life.

170
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,800
Don’t worry. Everyone trusts you.

171
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,480
Okay. I accept your challenge.

172
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,560
If you lose,

173
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,920
I don’t want to see you
around Huo Wu anymore.

174
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,820
I’m never related to her.

175
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,760
Who would you wish to win this battle?

176
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
This is the last qualifying round.

177
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,160
Both competing teams

178
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,020
have the results of 13 to 0.

179
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,620
But there will be only one winner today.

180
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,100
You can do this, boss.

181
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,840
You can do this, Brother San.

182
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,950
Both schools suggested one match

183
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,050
to decide the champion of the qualifying rounds.

184
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,770
After discussion, the organizer has

185
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,030
approved the request.

186
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,550
Feng Xiao Tian of Shen Feng School
defeated many strong opponents.

187
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,510
Same goes to Tang San

188
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,660
from Shrek School, who has
shown miracles with his persistence.

189
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,000
So,

190
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,880
what kind of battle
will these two bring us?

191
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,440
Continental Soul Master Elite Tournament,

192
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,440
begins now.

194
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,260
<i>His Martial Soul is Gale Devil Wolf,
it’s even a double-headed wolf.</i>

195
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,360
<i>Could it be Mutated Martial Soul?</i>

196
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
Tang San, I admire you.

197
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,880
But I have to defeat you today.
No matter what it takes.

198
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,860
[Next Episode]

199
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,640
Wow, Little San is so powerful.

200
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,600
- No.
- I must win.

201
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,580
The strength is way stronger than the last time.

202
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,180
I’ve already...

203
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,100
Could I really be defeated this time?

204
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,740
Brother.

205
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,580
The Pope means...

206
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,240
Fellow Elders.

207
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,040
Our teacher doesn’t wish
to see this person in Martial Soul City.
