[Previous Episode]
I just wanted to figure out

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,660
whether you’re qualified to be his teachers.

22
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,380
How dare you, Dugu Bo!

23
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,060
There must be a problem.

24
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,580
Dugu Bo seemed afraid of Little San.

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,980
Even I myself can’t control the next poison.

26
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,080
I have two ways to cure the poison in your body.

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
but at the same time,

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
your poison power will also be neutralized.

29
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,620
Are you willing to do so?

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,910
[Soul Land]
[Episode 51]

31
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,760
This...

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,380
If you don’t believe that,

33
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,260
my blood contains medicinal
properties of two herbs,

34
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,440
I can give you a little to try.

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,120
But don’t blame me if
your cultivation is downgraded.

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,520
No need to try. You Little Freak.

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,260
How come you know so much!

38
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,820
I found a book when I was small.

39
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,500
There are plenty of exotic matters in it.

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,260
There’s a house of gold in the book.

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,600
This knowledge is naturally
derived from the book.

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,100
How about the other method?

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,400
The main reason why you’re
attacked by the poison

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,820
is the poison abilities you cultivated.

45
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,080
Since you’re using beast soul,

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,640
the poison would fuse itself into your body.

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,180
Even though your soul power
can transform and suppress it,

48
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,380
it has already become part of your body.

49
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,120
However, if you own a tool soul,

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,380
you only need to accumulate the poisons
of your body into your martial soul.

51
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,700
Then, it’ll not be a problem anymore.

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,010
For the second method,

53
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,510
if you want to retain your poison abilities

54
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,520
without causing any harm,

55
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,920
you’d have to find a parasite

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,080
as a storage for the poison.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,640
The parasite can be a soul bone.

58
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,920
Do you mean to

59
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,420
store the poison of my body in the soul bone?

60
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,660
So that it’ll not cause harm to myself.

61
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,620
Yes, the same goes to your granddaughter.

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,000
If there’s a suitable soul bone for her,

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,820
she can store the poison in it
while she’s cultivating.

64
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,160
Just like me now. Although I was poisoned,

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,380
yet the poison can be stored in Blue Silver Plant

66
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,900
and the soul bone of Eight Spiders.

67
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,280
So, the poison can’t attack me.

68
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,480
This is the only feasible method.

69
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,360
This will be a long journey.

70
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,460
It can be more than half a year.
Are you willing to try?

71
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,920
Little Freak, I’ve been wanted
to kill you several times.

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,140
Do you mean to help me?

73
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,180
Poison and antidote do coexist.

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,920
Any poison has its corresponding antidote.

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Coincidentally, I’m very fond of the antidotes.

76
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,180
All right, Little Freak.
There are few people who I admired.

77
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,700
But you’re one of them.

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,540
I’ll believe you as long as you can
cure me and my granddaughter.

79
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,560
There will be no issues with the
three promises I made to you.

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,300
I won’t kill you.

81
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,200
Now, you have to eat this first.

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,940
If you kill me in the treatment,

83
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,600
I’ll take you with me.

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,780
Having me to eat something you spat out.

85
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,760
This seems a bit nauseating!

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
Listen up,

87
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,700
this is a Dan Zhu that coagulated by evolving

88
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,220
the Jade Phosphor Serpent into Queen Serpent.

89
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,660
Half of my power is

90
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
contained in this Dan Zhu.

91
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,420
If I die,

92
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,860
it’ll be burst inside your body.

93
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,460
<i>The heat seems to be scattered
into my limbs and bones.</i>

94
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,700
Can you feel it?

95
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,300
As long as you don’t play tricks,

96
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,140
this Dan Zhu will be
beneficial to your cultivation.

97
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,580
I’ll remove it once you cure me.

98
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,720
Old Freak, I have a request too.

99
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,660
You can’t peep when I make the antidote for you.

100
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,020
Every night in between 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.,

101
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,320
you have to come here and take the
medicine one hour before you get ill.

102
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,080
All right.

103
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,280
Tang San, would you wish me to be your teacher?

104
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,920
Old Freak, I used to call you in this way.

105
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,500
I don’t feel like changing it.

106
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,800
Moreover, I don’t think you can
teach me anything about poison.

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,300
You might have to consult me.

108
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,260
You...

109
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:05,140
All right. Little Freak, let’s wait and see.

110
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,120
Dugu Bo.

111
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,140
It seems that I’d thank you.

112
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,280
<i>There isn’t any place best than this ever.</i>

113
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,600
<i>It shouldn’t be wasted.</i>

114
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,880
<i>Every each herb here is peerless and precious.</i>

115
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,000
<i>But, I shouldn’t be greedy.</i>

116
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,540
<i>It doesn’t matter. I can’t eat it.
But, it doesn’t mean I can’t take it.</i>

117
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,780
<i>By mixing my blood with Octa Dark Frost
and Fiery Soft Apricot,</i>

118
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,060
<i>its medicinal properties are much milder.</i>

119
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,680
<i>It’ll only have a therapeutic effect
if the dose is lowered.</i>

120
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,400
<i>Old Freak is still fooled by me.</i>

121
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,880
<i>He does not dare to put a test
on his poison abilities.</i>

122
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,780
[Six Months Later]

123
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,140
Little Freak, I’m here.

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,280
Little Freak, what are you doing?

125
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
It’s successful!

126
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:33,780
[Soul Land]

127
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
What is this?

128
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,020
This treasure can be fatal.

129
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,840
I can guarantee even if you’re hit by it,

130
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,420
you’ll not stay alive within three breaths.

131
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,280
These little things?

132
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,780
<i>Xuan Yu Hand.</i>

133
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,520
This poison can even kill
a Grand Soul Land Master.

134
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,340
Can kill a Grand Soul Land Master?
Are you kidding?

135
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,240
Do you know what’s hidden weapons?

136
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,100
A hidden weapon is a tool that can use in secret.

137
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,460
These three needles have to shot in a special way.

138
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,060
It’s also known as Yama’s Invitation.

139
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,280
Yama’s Invitation?

140
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,820
Yama is the God of Death.

141
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,000
If the God of Death sends you an invitation,

142
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
do you know what it means?

143
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,540
Of course, it means
bringing you back to his embrace.

144
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,600
No one dares to keep you,
if Yama wants you to die.

145
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Why are you so mysterious?
There are just a few needles!

146
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
<i>You don’t believe it?</i>

147
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,880
<i>Yes, I didn’t expect it either.</i>

148
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,820
<i>It’s a miracle to refine</i>

149
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,340
<i>the third top super Hidden Weapon
of Xuan Tian Records in Soul Land.</i>

150
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,580
<i>Enormous internal strength is required
to launch Yama’s Invitation.</i>

151
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,500
<i>And, I’m still unable to bear with it now.</i>

152
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,320
Old Freak, are you feeling better?

153
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,840
Little Freak, return the Dan Zhu to me!

154
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,420
Aren’t you afraid of me to poison you?

155
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,540
If I’ll be poisoned by you,
how can I be the Grand Venom Master?

156
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Little Freak, I will bring
my granddaughter here later.

157
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,980
You can leave here after you cure her.

158
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,420
But, your poison has not been cured yet.

159
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,440
I can’t trap you here for a lifetime.

160
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,280
I’ve too many poisons in my body.

161
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,000
I can’t store them all in the soul bone.

162
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,700
My body has already adapted to the poison.

163
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,220
If I don’t have any of it in my body,
it might be harmful to me.

164
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,120
You’re right as well.

165
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,740
So, just stop the treatment now.

166
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,340
It’s a waste. If you’re a few years elder,

167
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,780
I’ll marry my pretty granddaughter to you.

168
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,120
Then you’ll have to call me as Grandpa.

169
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,560
Forget about it!

170
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,980
Your granddaughter has well
inherited your genetic.

171
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,840
Moreover, she already has her lover,

172
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,180
the direct heir of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon’s family.

173
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,500
Regardless of the background or family power,

174
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,410
I lack a lot compared with Yu Tian Heng,

175
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,880
the third tribe’s descendant of the world.

176
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,320
Yu Tian Heng?
Will he be more outstanding than you?

177
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,660
My background?

178
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,680
I have none of it.

179
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,480
I’m just a blacksmith’s son
who was born in a remote village.

180
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,500
Then, how did you grow up all the way?

181
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,860
Tell me about your past.

182
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,480
Oh, I see.

183
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,680
Hold on. So where did you learn
about the poison?

184
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,140
I won’t believe if you got present attainments

185
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,660
by picking up a book.

186
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,090
This is a secret. I won’t tell you.

187
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,430
It’s up to you.

188
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,800
Catch it.

189
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,720
Is this soul guiding tool a bribe?

190
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,880
I already have this Twenty-Four
Moonlight Bridges gifted by my teacher.

191
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,320
You’d keep this for yourself
or your granddaughter.

192
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,480
Yan Yan has no much interest in the herbs.

193
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,960
Giving it to her is a waste.

194
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,220
Your soul guiding tool is pretty good,

195
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,800
but it can only keep dead things.

196
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,000
This Lucky Almighty Pouch
can keep living things.

197
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,920
In other words,

198
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,020
this little creature can be
kept inside without suffocating

199
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,660
as well as the fresh herbs.

200
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,080
You seemed to say you didn’t want it just now.

201
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,600
Then, return it to me.

202
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,940
How can you ask for the gifted thing back?

203
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,380
As you’re The Grand Soul Land Master,
don’t you feel embarrassed?

204
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,200
Little Freak, I promised you that

205
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,220
if you cure the poison in my body,

206
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,180
I’ll realize three wishes from yours.

207
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,200
Firstly, I won’t hurt anyone of Shrek School.

208
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,340
Now, I’ve gifted you this Lucky Almighty Pouch.

209
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,180
Can it be the second wish?

210
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,600
This pouch was gifted by you willingly.

211
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,120
I didn’t request it from you.

212
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,080
You!

213
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,260
I’m not going to take it for granted either.

214
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,180
Here’s my present as a return to you.

215
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,100
[Next Episode]
You still owe me two wishes, right?

216
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,300
I’ll agree if it doesn’t go against my principles.

217
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,480
Please, don’t regret it.

218
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,700
Little Freak, stop at there!

219
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,940
Although Dugu Bo is in favor of you，

220
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,940
we still have to stay vigilant as he’s weird.

221
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,680
Anyway, we have to settle all the past debts.
