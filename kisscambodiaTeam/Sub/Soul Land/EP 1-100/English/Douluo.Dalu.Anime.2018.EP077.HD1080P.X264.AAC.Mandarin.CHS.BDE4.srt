24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,500
Fourth soul skill, Fire Dance Dazzling Sun!

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,220
The victory is ours.

26
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,220
Too bad.

27
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
My Blue Silver Plant...

28
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,000

Blue Silver Cage!

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,460
As long as you can defeat Tang San,

31
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,820
I will agree to be with you.

32
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,640
This round is against Cang Hui School.

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,000
Grandmaster, please let me join it.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,400
Have you found Teacher Shi Nian?

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,280
Little San, you’ve shown too many abilities.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,160
Displaying too much is not advisable.

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
Master, why not let me join for this round?

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,380
No way. Your ability is very special.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,880
Plus the grudge they have with our Shrek School,

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,740
This time,

41
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,000
let’s end

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,620
our grudges with Cang Hui School.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 77]

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,480
Are you from Shrek School?

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,640
Yes. Who are you?

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,580
I am Feng Xiao Tian. We’ll meet in a match later.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,660
You must do your best to destroy Cang Hui School.

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,880
Well, of course.

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,940
You must be Tang San.

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,800
You mustn’t lose before fighting our school.

51
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,500
I can’t let anyone else
defeat Shrek School before me.

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,340
Otherwise,  Huo Wu might be a girlfriend
of someone else.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Something’s wrong with him.

54
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,220
After identification, he’s crazy.

55
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,760
The twelfth match is about to start.

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,600
Participants from Shrek School
and Cang Hui School,

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,720
please be prepared.

58
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,880
Welcome to the twelfth preliminary.

59
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,140
I am your old friend, Dou Dou.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,680
As we all know, Shrek School has

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,600
won for eleventh round straight.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,860
However, Cang Hui School has only
got 8 wins for 11 games.

63
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,380
This group of jerks!

64
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,160
There may be no suspense for this game.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,500
But let’s anticipate

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,600
how long Cang Hui School can hold on.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,260
Next,

68
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,700
let’s welcome the participants
from both teams with applause!

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,020
No matter what’s the price to pay,
we must kill them.

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,840
The formation of Cang Hui School is quite weird.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,820
Such a formation hasn’t been shown,
since the preliminaries started.

72
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,040
Shrek’s formation hasn’t changed.

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,060
Keen Attack Branch’s Jing Ling who’s in
charge of fast attack hauled to the end.

74
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,420
Are they ready to make a quick battle?

75
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,740
Today, Shrek sends Soul Sect,
Zhu Zhu Qing

76
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,140
to replace soul master
Jiang Zhu of Support Branch.

77
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,560
Does it mean Cang Hui is more powerful

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,200
than Chi Huo School in their mind?

79
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,840
Tang San, we are at feud with each other.

80
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,920
Next, let’s have a look

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,960
at the information of both teams.

82
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
[Shrek] vs. [Cang Hui]

83
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,420
[Dai Mu Bai] vs. [Zhang Jing Yang]

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,060
[Tai Long] vs. [Dong He Guang]

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,860
[Tang San] vs. [Shen Xin Shui]

90
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,040
I announce the twelfth preliminary

91
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,800
between Shrek School and Cang Hui School

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,540
begins.

93
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,200
You come over.

94
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,820
Too arrogant. Let’s go!

95
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,760
Don’t be reckless.
Listen to my order. Stay focus.

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,580
Master San, just let us go and fight to end this.

97
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,400
Today, four players of Cang Hui School

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
make their debut.

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,500
That’s a big difference from Master’s list.

100
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,320
Good. It seems that Little San also realized it.

101
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,360
What did he realize, Grandmaster?

102
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,680
The participants that Cang Hui School sent

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,420
are mostly new here.

104
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,640
This means two possibilities.

105
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,560
First, Cang Hui School is preparing to give up.

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,200
Second, they have hidden their strength

107
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,900
in the previous matches.

108
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,640
They purposely retained their strength
until the battle with Shrek School.

109
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,520
So, you from Shrek School
are a bunch of cowards.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,300
You!

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,700
Don’t act rashly.

112
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,800
What happened?

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,060
Why hasn’t Shrek School attacked?

114
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,920
Theoretically, they should pre-empt
and subdue quickly.

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,380
Is Shrek School afraid of Cang Hui School?

116
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,720
They can still calm down
under this situation. Good.

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,520
The most taboo in a battle
is to take the enemy lightly.

118
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,500
In your opinion,
why aren’t they starting yet?

119
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,600
Tang San must have realized
something is not right.

120
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
So, he didn’t let his teammates start.

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,580
He has a calm mind.

122
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,680
He doesn’t seem like only have...

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,680
<i>Awful. They’re still not starting
even I provoked.</i>

124
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,120
You are really steady.

125
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,260
But all tactics and skills are futile,

126
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,720
when facing absolute strength.

127
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,260
Finally, you’re not pretending anymore.

128
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Seven Shura Fantasy!

129
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,100
It’s Seven In One Martial Soul Fusion Skill!

130
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,440
Seven In One Martial Soul Fusion Skill?

131
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
What a terrify power.

132
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,159
<i>No. It’s not Seven In One
Martial Soul Fusion Skill.</i>

133
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,619
<i>No one can complete
Seven In One Martial Soul Fusion Skill.</i>

134
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,880
<i>This could be only the use of a fusion skill.</i>

135
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,220
This year’s Advanced Soul Master School Contest

136
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,700
has really opened my eyes.

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
You are the first ones who experience
our Seven Shura Fantasy.

138
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,680
You’ll also be the ones who die
from Seven Shura Fantasy.

139
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,180
Close your eyes.

140
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,280
What an amazing power.

141
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,660
Both teams have disappeared!

142
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,820
Cang Hui!

143
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,860
Kids!

144
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,240
No. We must stop this match immediately.

145
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,700
The kids will die.

146
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,300
Calm down. That is not Seven In One
Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

147
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,040
It’s a Seven In One Fusion Skill.

148
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,060
Aren’t they the same?

149
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,240
One is the sublimation of skill

150
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,780
by fusing the Martial Soul.

151
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,180
One is fusion skill activated by the
assistance of respective soul skills.

152
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,580
They’re different.

153
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,160
Can Little San and the others block it?

154
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,620
Shrek. Today you will be dead!

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,660
Shrek.

156
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,760
Reincarnate endlessly in this painful abyss!

157
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:38,540
[Soul Land]

158
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Brother.

159
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,260
Brother San.

160
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,080
Little San.

161
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,280
Master San!

162
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,580
<i>Everyone. No!</i>

163
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,300
Why are you talking nonsense?

164
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,180
This is deadly.

165
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,420
He’s just joking. He treats Little San as his son.

166
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,480
How can he not worry, if anything happens?

167
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,880
You...

168
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,520
Didn’t you see how Cang Hui control it?

169
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,660
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

170
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,480
Comparing with Shi Nian’s nightmare,
you’re still far behind.

171
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,980
You really met Teacher Shi Nian.

172
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,240
Seems like it’s right.
That thing is with you, right?

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,680
I got it this easily.

174
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,060
Do you want to kill me? Aren’t you
afraid of the punishment of the contest?

175
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,300
In the Shura Fantasy,

176
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,780
your death will only be an accident
under my tactic.

177
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,940
Shrek. Goodbye.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
Impossible.

179
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,520
Is this the motto of Cang Hui School?

180
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,100
How did you do it?

181
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,240
Fantasy is a lie to the vision.

182
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,800
If the lie is seen,

183
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,120
how would the person who lied be punished?

184
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,800
My body can’t move.

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,780
Everyone...

186
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,420
Students of Cang Hui School fell down.

187
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,840
Tang San...

188
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,560
What happened?

189
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,220
Little San is injured.

190
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,340
So, this is it.

191
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,660
What actually happened?

192
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,360
This is the most tragic match,
since the preliminary started.

193
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,500
Shrek School won!

194
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:08,660
Shrek!

195
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Little San, how do you feel?

196
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,440
Teacher Qin, don’t worry. We’re just pretending.

197
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,400
Little San, you’re too cruel.

198
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,160
I’m afraid seven of them are going to be disabled.

199
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,580
They’re destined not to be our friends.

200
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,240
The fantasy may be real the next time.

201
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,620
Brother San, I support you.

202
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,840
Being kind to the enemy is cruel to yourself.

203
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,940
Little San, come here.

204
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,680
Students from Cang Hui School
are mentally injured.

205
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
The medical experts have confirmed that

206
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,260
they can’t recover.

207
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,660
Xiao Gang has taken cover
with the other members who participated.

208
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,600
You have to accept an interrogation

209
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,440
as the only person
who stood on the stage.

210
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,940
If the investigators ask
what happened on the field,

211
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,300
what shall I do?

212
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,760
Don’t know.

213
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,660
What?

214
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,180
You really don’t know anything, right?

215
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,640
Just like the audience.

216
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,880
You didn’t see what happened...

217
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,320
Dean, you’re saying that

218
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,860
Boss Fu is the expert in this field.

219
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,120
Don’t let me down.
Little San, did you get it?

220
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,920
Yes. I got it.

221
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,080
Okay. Regulate your breath in the lounge first.

222
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,420
I will ask someone to call you
when needed.

223
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,240
Okay.

224
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,620
Dean. The organizing committees are here.

225
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,840
This is fast. Who are they?

226
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,140
Ning Feng Zhi and Salas.

227
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,540
<i>The Martial Soul Hall and imperial family
are involved in the investigation.</i>

228
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,600
Let’s meet them.

229
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,260
Dean Frander.

230
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,240
You should know our purpose being here.

231
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,000
Shrek School has badly injured students
from Cang Hui School in a match.

232
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,660
How can you explain?

233
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,180
What? Students from Cang Hui School
have become stupid?

234
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,580
Lord, students from Cang Hui School
are badly injured.

235
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,440
Aren’t students from Shrek school
badly injured too?

236
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Please don’t be unfair.

237
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,100
Don’t act silly!

238
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
For this kind of killing behaviour,

239
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,240
it’s not allowed in the contest.

240
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
Call the students
who participated in the contest!

241
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,720
I want to interrogate every one of them.

242
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,680
[Next Episode]
Starts.

243
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,080
It’s said that Tian Shui School has all girls.

244
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,200
How can we fight?

245
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,720
Anyways, we just pray not to meet them so soon.

246
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,100
Dai Mu Bai from Shrek School is so handsome!

247
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,240
Seems like Little San has met his opponent.

248
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Boss Dai and others, I’m sorry.

249
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,300
How can you jump to conclusions?

250
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,500
Salas!

251
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
You asked for it.

252
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,900
How dare you still have contact with that woman!

253
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,640
Are they looking down on us?

254
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,340
I announce

255
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,920
Shrek School is removed from this contest!
