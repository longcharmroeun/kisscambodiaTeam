Only teams that joined the preliminary

[Episode 83]

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,100
Nice to meet you, Chief Ning.

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,100
He’s my disciple, Xue Qing He.

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,280
This way, please.

37
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,720
In fact, we come with a bold request.

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,480
Oh, please go ahead.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,700
Under the tutelage of you and the teachers,

40
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,120
Rong Rong has improved a lot.

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
If possible,

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,080
I’d like to send some of our youth
to study at Shrek School.

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
Pardon?

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,160
I wonder if it’s feasible?

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,240
I think this is inappropriate, Chief Ning?

46
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,860
How can our school compare
with your prestige education?

47
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,100
Nothing is inappropriate.

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,180
I believe Grandmaster’s capability in teaching.

49
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,300
It must be the top among the entire continent.

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,220
Thanks for your high regards,
I’ll put in my utmost effort.

51
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,580
Having support from Qibao Amber Tribe,

52
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,680
Shrek School no longer has
to worry about school funds.

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,100
The teaching materials could be renewed,

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,760
and to recruit more teachers.

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,220
Becoming the first-class school
is now within our reach.

56
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,919
Dean, what are you smiling about?

57
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,820
We’re greatly honoured...

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,240
and we deeply appreciate.

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,580
Regarding the details of cooperation,

60
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,140
let’s discuss further after...

61
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,880
the Continental Soul Master School Elite Tournament.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,800
Everyone, good luck in the qualifying rounds.

63
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,120
Shrek will do our best.

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,260
Teacher, it’s late. We have to leave.

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,100
Dad, why are you leaving so early?

66
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,960
It’s too bad I’m from the Support Branch,

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,860
I can’t be in the qualifying rounds.

68
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,640
Otherwise, I’ll show you my current strength.

69
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,680
Not necessary.

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,000
I believe Frander’s tutelage.

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,940
After graduating from Shrek School,

72
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,420
I’ll officially announce you
as the next tribe chief.

73
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,240
You’re my only daughter,

74
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,640
this is your inborn duty.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,380
With my current health condition,

76
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,180
I’m still able to lead the tribe for years.

77
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,560
Isn’t this period enough for you
to enjoy yourself?

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,420
<i>Little Ao has been working hard since I told him.</i>

79
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,600
<i>What if...</i>

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,740
<i>What will happen to Little Ao?</i>

81
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,840
It’s late, Qing He and I would take our leave.

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,140
Goodbye.

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,920
Tang San, see you.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,160
Looking forward to your performance
in the qualifying rounds.

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,060
Sure, I’ll do my best. See you, Brother Xue.

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,520
Little San, this Xue Qing He...

87
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,640
is that Xue Qing He, right?

88
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,880
Dean, you’ve realized it?

89
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,080
I think I’m right in my guess.

90
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,680
<i>I promised Brother Xue
not to reveal his identity.</i>

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
<i>Perhaps, he has his reason.</i>

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Great, Shrek School is going to be developed.

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,060
I didn’t see him for a short while,

94
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,460
and Tang San’s aura has greatly improved.

95
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,940
I’m sure his soul power has developed too.

96
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,120
He’s noteworthy.

97
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,820
Yes, you’re right.

98
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,960
Everyone, the drawing result
for tomorrow’s game is out.

99
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
The first-round opponent is Barak School.

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Barak?

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,000
I remembered that Shrek School
was located at Barak in Suo Tuo City.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
They entered the qualifying rounds too?

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament...

104
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,160
consists of preliminary rounds,
qualifying rounds and finals.

105
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,360
Tian Dou Empire has six preliminary divisions.

106
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
They’re Tian Dou City Branch,
the four great vassal kingdoms,

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,820
and one vassal duchy
wield a preliminary division each.

108
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,200
Tian Dou City Branch
possesses five quotas.

109
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,900
And vassal kingdoms and duchy
possesses two quotas each.

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,600
It makes up a total of 15 quotas
to the qualifying rounds.

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,840
While the Barak Kingdom...

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,640
is one of the four biggest
vassal kingdoms of Tian Dou Empire.

113
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,040
Shrek had also fought for a quota
of Barak Kingdom,

114
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,060
however, due to the suppression of royals,

115
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,080
we failed to get the quota to enter
the qualifying rounds.

116
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,060
Meanwhile, I had missed
Advanced Soul Master School Tournament.

117
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,720
This has become my greatest lifetime regret.

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,820
Barak.

119
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,040
Teacher Qin, please be rest assured.

120
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,260
Shrek Seven Devils will do our best...

121
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,420
to defeat Barak School.

122
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,560
Yes.

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,640
But, the rules of qualifying rounds
is much different from the previous one.

124
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,080
Both teams send out seven members.

125
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,240
Each member has to fight until they’re defeated.

126
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,040
If they win, they will have to fight the next rival...

127
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,980
until all seven of the rivals are defeated.

128
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,140
It means it’s a one-on-one battle
rather than a team battle?

129
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,140
Yes.

130
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,360
Master, please let me duel.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,860
I’m good in melee, I’ll surely win.

132
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,100
Little San, please don’t be anxious.

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,080
All teachers have decided...

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,640
to send Xiao Wu first.

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,860
Okay.

136
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,080
I hereby announce...

137
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,010
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament,

138
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,660
Qualifying Rounds.

139
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,240
officially begins.

140
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:25,460
[Soul Land]

141
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,660
Looking forward to your excellent performance.

142
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,360
Long live the Emperor.

143
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,200
Little San, it seems like you’ve
offended many beauties.

144
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
One is Huo Wu, another one is Shui Bing Er.

145
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,340
Do you think others
would consider you as a playboy?

146
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,280
I was wondering who they are?

147
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,280
It’s Shrek, the losers of Suo Tuo City.

148
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,340
Lofchy.

149
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,060
You’re just as annoying as your father.

150
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,880
<i>What’s going on? Does Dean know him?</i>

151
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,220
Frander, I think your Shrek is the annoying one.

152
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,560
I advise you and your losers
to out of the field as soon as possible.

153
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,180
Please don’t disgrace our Barak Kingdom.

154
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,900
<i>Barak? They’re from Barak School.</i>

155
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,360
We from Shrek are ethical and with integrity.

156
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,180
The one smeared the good name
of soul masters is you.

157
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,340
Frander, my father kindly advised you years ago.

158
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,340
How dare you didn’t accept it.

159
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,680
I heard you’ve ridden
on Lanba School’s coattail.

160
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,260
What’s more, it’s a woman’s school.

161
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,060
Frander,

162
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,460
if I were you, I’d feel so ashamed.

163
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,900
Scoundrel.

164
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,140
Teacher Zhao, you’ll be against the rules
if you beat him here.

165
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,520
Come on. I’m here for you.

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,080
Frander, you’re such a coward.

167
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,900
Let’s leave.

168
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,140
Dean, Teacher Zhao, what exactly has happened?

169
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,580
It was because Shrek lacked
new student recruits,

170
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,060
therefore, the royals of Barak
weren’t able to gain profits.

171
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,960
Hence, they’ve always belittled us.

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,500
If without the support of alumnus,

173
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,020
Shrek wouldn’t be able to survive till now.

174
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,200
Does Barak have such great power?

175
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,460
Among the four kingdoms of
Tian Dou Empire,

176
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,820
Barak Kingdom possesses
the most powerful military power.

177
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,040
It can be considered as
the portal of Tian Dou Empire.

178
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,300
They wield absolute power.

179
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,320
Except for necessary tributes,
they’re fully autonomous.

180
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,660
Who’s that Lofchy?

181
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,400
How could he address
your name disrespectfully?

182
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,940
Lofchy’s father is in charge of
the education department of Suo Tuo City.

183
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,680
He always instigates those royals
to go against us.

184
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,320
He’s like a thorn in the flesh.

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,640
There’re so many people living under
their suppression in Suo Tuo City.

186
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,280
Xiao Wu, in this duel,

187
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,520
you must put them to shame.

188
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,820
Teacher Zhao, Dean, don’t worry.

189
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,840
I’ll definitely win this duel.

190
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,420
Next,

191
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,040
Shrek School versus Barak School.

192
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,060
Let’s look at their data.

193
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,380
Fighting!

194
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,300
<i>It’s Xiao Wu’s turn now,</i>

195
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,240
<i>hopefully, she won’t be hurt.</i>

196
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
Lofchy is at Level 42.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,180
No wonder he’s so arrogant.

198
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,060
Will Xiao Wu...

199
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,200
I believe Xiao Wu and Master’s judgment too.

200
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,360
Barak School first participant, their captain.

201
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,540
A Soul Sect at Level 42.

202
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,860
Perhaps, they want to win in the first round.

203
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,420
But their opponent is Shrek,
who aced in the preliminary.

204
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,880
It must be an exciting game.

205
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,100
Does Shrek like to swagger around?

206
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,000
By sending a little girl?

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,240
It’s must be the worthy student of coward Frander.

208
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,100
Fatty, what’s wrong?

209
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,400
Have you forgotten that Bu Le?

210
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,560
He was beaten by Xiao Wu’s Eight Flinging...

211
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,700
Start.

212
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,960
Brother, I think you’re right.

213
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Here’s a place I shouldn’t come.

214
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,160
Brother, please give way to me.

215
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,340
I’ll treat you gently...

216
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
See you.

217
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
Nice. That arrogant Barak School deserves this.

218
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,760
How could they not know of our Shrek?

219
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,500
Suppressing people. They ask for that.

220
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Next.

221
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,520
What are you doing?

222
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,220
Judge, I report they purposely take revenge.

223
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,759
Why? You’re not convinced?

224
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,120
You...

225
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,740
Or do you want a gang fight?

226
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,700
Are you keen to die?

227
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,430
[Next Episode]

228
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,740
You have to pay for what you have done.

229
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,640
This is a competition. What are you doing?

230
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,360
What is Little San doing?

231
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,020
I never expect that Shrek’s student
has a soul bone.

232
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,180
Tang San, remember what you’ve said.
