[Episode 30]

23
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,390
Finally, we’re back.

24
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,970
You must be tired after walking for a whole day.

25
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,150
Get some rest first.

26
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,150
I’m starving to death.

27
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,120
Let’s go and have a meal.

28
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,149
It’s not your fault.

29
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,539
Even if we led them,

30
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,230
I’m afraid we wouldn’t be spared
when we encountered Titan Giant Ape.

31
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,520
This is true.

32
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
This time, Titan Giant Ape appearing
at the outer part of the forest

33
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,180
might be a coincidence.

34
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,240
However, the bull roar that Xiao Wu mentioned is...

35
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,420
I’ve never heard about a bull roar
that could frighten the Titan Giant Ape.

36
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,710
The bull roar you’re saying
should be the Azure Bull Python.

37
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,690
The person who knows about it is here.

38
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,240
Come on, Wu Ji. Let me introduce him to you.

39
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,930
He is my old partner, Yu Xiao Gang.

40
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,570
He’s also Tang San’s master.

41
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,160
You can call him Grandmaster.

42
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
Oh, so you’re the Grandmaster.

43
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,790
Hello. I am Zhao Wu Ji.

44
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,330
Acala, nice to meet you.

45
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,390
Take a seat.

46
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,000
Grandmaster, do you know about me too?

47
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,750
Tang San should have come back with you, right?

48
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,270
Is he all right?

49
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,070
You are on a new and long journey.

50
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,570
Yes, how about you?
Are those memories in the past

51
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,220
and even you

52
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,230
only my illusions?

53
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,750
Every memory is a wave in the long journey of life.

54
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,650
Staying alive is the best proof.

55
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,380
Do I still have a chance to go back?

56
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,770
You’ve already decided it, haven’t you?

57
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,340
If you can’t forget me,

58
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,470
then bravely walk out of your own way

59
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,000
on this land

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,400
with our common wish.

61
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,410
Our common wish?

62
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,940
That’s right. A way of my own.

63
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,900
I want to build a Tang Clan

64
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,310
that belongs to me on this land.

65
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,910
It’s threatening but not dangerous this time.

66
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,260
I didn’t expect that we can all return
after encountered Titan Giant Ape.

67
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,800
Xiao Gang, what do you mean by the Azure Bull Python?

68
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,300
Azure Bull Python is a more powerful soul beast

69
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
than the Titan Giant Ape in Star Dou Forest.

70
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
It’s more powerful than Titan Giant Ape?

71
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,490
If Titan Giant Ape is the King of Star Dou Forest,

72
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,730
then Azure Bull Python is
the Emperor of Star Dou Forest.

73
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,250
I heard about it

74
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,160
from a Grand Soul Land Master.

75
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,520
He entered the core of Star Dou Forest before.

76
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,430
It’s a lake like a fairyland.

77
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,880
A lake?

78
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,120
Yes.

79
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,050
The core of Star Dou Forest is not a forest,

80
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,670
but a lake.

81
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,320
that Grand Soul Land Master
was confident with his ability.

82
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,460
So, he wanted to go deep into the forest

83
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,760
and search for King of Forest,
Titan Giant Ape for a battle.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,160
Finally, he found the Titan Giant Ape.

85
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,600
However, he didn’t manage to
battle with Titan Giant Ape.

86
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,340
Is it because of the Azure Bull Python?

87
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,020
Yes.

88
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,200
When that Grand Soul Land Master
reached the core of the forest,

89
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,210
he saw Titan Giant Ape
was drinking water by the lake.

90
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,060
When he was ready to battle
with Titan Giant Ape,

91
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,680
the lake suddenly boiled.

92
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,550
Next, a huge bull head appeared
from the water surface.

93
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,270
A sudden pressure made him unable to move.

94
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,160
Then, the bull head continued to rise.

95
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,980
Finally, a giant with a bull head and
python body appeared on the lake.

96
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:59,660
The most terrifying thing was the giant
bull python could speak human language.

97
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,760
Human, it’s not easy for you to cultivate.
Leave this place.

98
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,150
That giant is the Azure Bull Python.

99
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,780
Do you know how the Titan Giant Ape reacted

100
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,780
when the Azure Bull Python appeared?

101
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,370
How?

102
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,370
Titan Giant Ape was like a child being punished.

103
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,400
It seems you were really lucky this time.

104
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,580
Talking about this, we have to thank Tang San.

105
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,820
I’ve read through the details of these students.

106
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,000
What kind of soul ring has the child
from the Food Branch found?

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,090
You can’t wait to work.

108
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,410
Since I’ve promised you,
I will definitely do my best.

109
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,920
Don’t you forget about your promise.

110
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,920
Teacher Zhao.

111
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,550
This time, it’s quite lucky.

112
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,360
Oscar has got a soul ring of
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent.

113
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,570
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent has a mild nature.

114
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,960
But it’s very cunning and good at running away.

115
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,920
It’s more outstanding than
any other soul rings I expected.

116
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,500
If I’ve not mistaken,

117
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,050
speed should be the skill of
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent’s soul ring.

118
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,380
You’re right.

119
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,940
Oscar’s third soul skill is
a mushroom-like sausage.

120
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,610
By eating it, he can fly at the Phoenix
Tail Crest Serpent’s speed for 1 minute.

121
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,500
Fly at the Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent’s
speed for 1 minute?

122
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,400
Yes.

123
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,560
The child’s talent is unprecedented.

124
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,310
Our Shrek School only accepts monsters.

125
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,370
Too bad it’s the last batch.

126
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,360
However, it’s lucky to have your help.

127
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,830
As long as we work together,

128
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,440
we can surely train these children well.

129
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
In no more than 10 years,

130
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,690
the soul masters’ world will shake
because of Shrek.

131
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,030
I stay on for Little San.

132
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,710
Don’t forget your promise.

133
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,540
You can rest assured.
We’re brothers for so many years.

134
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,160
When do I break my promise?

135
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,470
Moreover,

136
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,840
we’ll have to wait for Little San to reach
Level 40 for his next soul beast hunt.

137
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,940
You’re saying that he has reached Level 30?

138
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,120
I believe Little San’s future will
surpass the owner of this token.

139
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,510
[Soul Land]

140
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,990
Is it true?

141
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,730
Master.

142
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,040
Master, you’re here.

143
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,980
Go back to the team first.

144
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,020
Yes.

145
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,760
Let’s go.

146
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,090
Little San, who’s that uncle?

147
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,070
My master.

148
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,440
Your master?

149
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,140
Is he the master that you’ve always mentioned

150
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,410
who knows everything?

151
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,000
Little monsters, look over here.

152
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,710
Let me introduce. This is Grandmaster.

153
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,920
He will be responsible for guiding
your cultivation in the future.

154
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,490
I’ve read your details.

155
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,070
Next, I’ll guide your cultivation.

156
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,070
I hope all of you can be prepared.

157
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,320
We’ll start the training tomorrow morning.

158
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,860
I’ll announce the content of training
tomorrow before class.

159
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,590
Such a short spoken person.

160
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,410
Okay. Little monsters.

161
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,120
Make ways, everyone!

162
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,120
Both of you don’t touch them.

163
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,800
Teacher, Little San...

164
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,080
Xiao Gang, this is...

165
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,700
Carry Ma Hong Jun to the house.

166
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,110
Little San, can you hear me?

167
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,670
Relax and take a deep breath.

168
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,640
Try to imagine that your soul bones
are retracted into your body.

169
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,150
How is it?

170
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,300
Little San, it’s all right. Try again.

171
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,790
Let the air flow.

172
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,220
Take the soul bones as part of your body.

173
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,090
Just like your limbs.

174
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,570
Don’t try too hard.

175
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,460
Let it be natural. Just like breathing.

176
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,430
Little San.

177
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,820
Little San, you remove the toxins for Ma Hong Jun.

178
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,750
Master, can I?

179
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,150
You can retract the soul bones
according to your consciousness.

180
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,110
Believe in yourself. You should feel it.

181
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,390
Control your soul bones and
draw the toxins from Ma Hong Jun’s body.

182
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,840
Just like retracting the soul bones
into your body.

183
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,560
But, if...

184
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,860
Don’t think about any other things.

185
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,250
Just think that soul bones are part of your body.

186
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,630
You can easily draw the toxins
out of Ma Hong Jun’s body.

187
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,410
But...

188
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,780
It’ll be too late if the toxins enter the heart.

189
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,880
Control the soul bones and
penetrate Ma Hong Jun’s wound.

190
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,320
Mind freely. It’s not hard to do it.

191
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,730
How is it?

192
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,640
He’s fine. He’ll wake up in a while.

193
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
I’ll go in and have a look.

194
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,650
Little San, remember. An innocent man
gets into trouble because of his ability.

195
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,790
Brother. How do you feel?

196
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,090
I’m all right now.

197
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,340
Maybe I was not getting used to the soul ring.

198
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,920
Master said that it’s all right.

199
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,260
Is it really okay?

200
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,280
It’s all right. You guys should go in and check Fatty.

201
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,050
Just now...

202
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,700
Let’s go and check Fatty.

203
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,480
Little San, you must tell us if there’s any problem.

204
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,410
Remember that we are brothers.

205
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,730
I will. Go on in.

206
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,000
Brother, are you all right?

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,280
What did Teacher mean just now?

208
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,900
I’m really all right. Don’t worry.

209
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,030
Do you know about
the externally attached soul bone?

210
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,740
Master said the one at your back is...

211
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,640
[Next Episode]
Xiao Wu, we would be are together forever, right?

212
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,790
What do you need?

213
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,740
I’m afraid you couldn’t make this decision.

214
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,300
Great Soul Master?

215
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,510
From tomorrow on,

216
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,550
you’ll be greeted with the life of hell.

217
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,420
Super Invincible Sausage!

218
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,780
Dai Mu Bai, dequeue.

219
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,360
Defeat them one by one.

220
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,350
What?
