[Previous Episode]
Is your father Tang Hao?

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,420
How did you know that?

21
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,440
I’m Tai Tan. Greetings, Young Master.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,940
Now that you’ve appeared,

23
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,240
the Li Tribe

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,860
will die for you.

25
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,100
We’ll die for you, Young Master!

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,620
I’m interested in your hidden weapons.

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,520
We’ve seen Rong Rong’s hidden weapons.

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,580
I want a set just like hers.

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,740
I want 500 sets. I’ll give 10,000
gold soul coins for every set.

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,380
I’m only in charge of the final step.

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,720
For the initial steps,

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,220
Uncle Ning, you need to think of something.

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,360
[Soul Land]
[Episode 60]

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,120
Isn’t it too easy to gain 50,000 gold soul coins?

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,700
If Uncle Ning finds the price unreasonable,

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,080
you can lower the price. I have no objections.

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,920
No need for that. Although I’m not a great man,

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,270
our Qiber Amber Tribe will keep our promise.

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,520
[50,000 gold soul coins]

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,560
If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave now.

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Rong Rong, you can follow Little San back.

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,940
Feng Zhi, what do you think?
Is he really the son of Tang Hao?

44
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,140
I’m sure of it.

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,860
I didn’t expect Tang Hao

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,140
to have an outstanding son
after he left the Hao Tian Tribe.

47
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,960
The Hao Tian Tribe is higher in statue
than our Qibao Amber Tribe.

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,860
If he continues to grow,

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,640
he’ll be a threat to us.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,900
Uncle Bone, please don’t say that again.

51
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,360
Although the Hao Tian Tribe
is higher in statue than our tribe,

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
the Upper Three are friendly with each other.

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,740
We have no reason to sabotage his tribe.

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,680
But if this kid becomes a Grand Soul Land Master,

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,240
our Qibao Amber Tribe

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,340
can never make a comeback.

57
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,820
Compared with the condition in Soul Land,

58
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,480
the feuds of the tribes are nothing.

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,140
Tribe chief, are you saying that...

60
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,560
When I was young,

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,260
many soul masters were fighting
each other to be the very best.

62
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,740
But now,

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
this kind of fighting almost disappeared.

64
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,780
And the Soul Land is tranquil.

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,160
Are you saying...

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,900
Although I’ve only got some clues,

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,260
these clues show that

68
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,060
Soul Land will experience a massive change soon.

69
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,220
For that, the Seven Major Tribes must be reunited.

70
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,760
Do you guys want to ask me something?

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,260
Nothing.

72
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,840
You can handle your own affairs.

73
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,960
I only know that you’re Little San
from the Shrek Seven Devils.

74
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,220
I still don’t understand what’s happening.

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,960
I don’t know what to ask.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,060
You never asked us about our background before.

77
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,800
Everyone has their own privacy.
I won’t ask anything.

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,100
We’re only concerned about your well-being.

79
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,260
We’re relieved now that you’ve returned safely.

80
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,380
Xiao Wu,

81
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,100
are you saying that
my father would hurt Brother San?

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,760
Here’s a secret.

83
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,260
My father bought 500 sets of
hidden weapons from Brother San just now.

84
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,840
He paid him 5 million gold soul coins on the spot.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,580
- What?
- What?

86
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,680
What are you guys trying to do?

87
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,300
What are we trying to do?

88
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,280
We’re robbing you

89
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,760
of course!

90
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,080
Rong Rong, you returned earlier than I expected.

91
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,680
I was worried that you couldn’t return.

92
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,660
I said I would return, didn’t I?

93
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,940
Why did you think I wouldn’t come back?

94
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,420
It’s because...

95
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,740
What’s wrong? Tell me.

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,500
<i>Let me give you two words.</i>

97
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,920
<i>Be sincere.</i>

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,060
Rong Rong, can you give me your answer?

99
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,980
Answer?

100
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,680
You have a feeling for me, am I right?

101
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,540
You!

102
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,660
If you do, it means that I have a chance.

103
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,060
I will work hard!

104
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,200
I will work hard to gain your father’s permission!

105
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,720
Rong Rong? Why are you here?

106
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
Dad, are you leaving?

107
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
I still have many things to handle.

108
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,280
You must listen to your teachers.

109
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,860
And train hard.

110
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,440
Teacher Zhao, I’ll leave her to you.

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,260
If the school needs any help,

112
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,560
our Qibao Amber Tribe will help you gladly.

113
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Tribe Chief Ning, don’t worry.

114
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,720
We will take good care of Rong Rong.

115
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,360
Farewell. I’ll stop here.

116
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,100
Rong Rong, why is your face so red?

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,960
Are you sick?

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,920
It’s nothing. I’m fine.

119
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,520
Dad, can’t you stay longer?

120
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,460
Silly girl.

121
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,400
I’m proud of your results.

122
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
Not only did you grow stronger,

123
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,600
you grew up as a person too.

124
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,400
You should talk to your Brother San more often.

125
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,500
You can learn many things from him.

126
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
Okay.

127
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,690
<i>No. I need to clarify things with Oscar.</i>

128
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,860
<i>He must know about the rules
of the Qibao Amber Tribe at least.</i>

129
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,000
<i>If I tell him about the rules now,</i>

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,160
<i>will he give up?</i>

131
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,860
<i>But if I don’t tell him now, he’ll...</i>

132
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,260
<i>Never mind. I’ll wait until the
Advanced Soul Masters’ meeting is over.</i>

133
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,700
<i>I’ll tell him then.</i>

134
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,400
No. No. No.

Boss Dai!

137
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,520
Little San, thank you.

138
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,360
Boss Dai,

139
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,540
I thought you would hug Zhu Qing first.

140
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,720
Little Ao, are you asking for a beating?

141
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,140
I hugged Little San because he helped me.

142
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,780
After I got my soul ring,

143
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,180
I felt the improvement of my soul power.

144
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,400
Now, I’m are Level 43.

145
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
It’s all because of the
Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum.

146
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,180
Everyone must work hard now.

147
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,460
We mustn’t let Little San’s treasures go to waste.

148
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,420
Before the competition starts,

149
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,680
you all must get to Level 40 at least.

150
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,600
We only have one goal.

151
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,300
We must be the champion!

152
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,180
Yeah! Champion!

153
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,300
Little San.

154
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,300
Follow me.

155
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,000
Grandmaster is trying to persuade Little San.

156
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,980
I’m a bit worried.

157
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,320
I’ll follow him.

158
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,980
Okay.

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,820
Master, you knew about my background?

160
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,220
I knew that.

161
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,960
I knew that a long time ago.

162
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,980
What?

163
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,840
You don’t need to be surprised.

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,840
When you first came to Nuoding School,

165
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,600
I accepted you as my disciple.

166
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,620
Because I saw your potential
of the Twin Martial Soul.

167
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,240
But I can’t confirm that your other
Martial Soul was the Hao Tian Hammer.

168
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,940
Until one day, your father came to see me.

169
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,120
And he gave me this.

170
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,540
<i>That’s why, I hope I can leave Little San to you.</i>

171
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,900
<i>He’s my son.</i>

172
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,600
Is this the badge of the highest rank
in Martial Soul Hall?

173
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,460
Only then, I knew who your father was.

174
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,640
He’s famous in Soul Land.

175
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
He’s my idol too.

176
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,900
He’s Tang Hao, the youngest Grand Soul Land Master.

177
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,600
Hao Tian as his title.

178
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,820
Grand Hao Tian Master?

179
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,020
I don’t know him well.

180
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,340
He just asked me to take care of you.

181
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,340
There are six icons on this badge.

182
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,620
There are two parts.

183
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,040
The first part contains the three
Grand Soul Land Masters in the Martial Hall.

184
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,060
For the second part,

185
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,420
it contains the three Grand Soul
Land Masters of the Seven Major Tribes.

186
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,680
The sword on the badge

187
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,360
represents Master Luo Chen Xin
from the Qibao Amber Tribe.

188
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,400
The dragon

189
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,040
represents the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon
from my tribe.

190
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,200
The hammer represents the
Hao Tian Hammer from the Hao Tian Tribe.

191
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,420
The Hao Tian Tribe had two
Grand Soul Land Masters.

192
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,920
Tang Xiao and Tang Hao, the two brothers.

193
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,180
They were the strongest in Soul Land once.

194
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,980
When your father received the title,

195
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,720
he was only 44 years old.

196
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,560
According to rumors,
he got to Level 90 all by himself.

197
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,740
And he defeated two Grand Soul
Land Masters from the Martial Hall.

198
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,360
They’re represented by the chrysanthemum
and the human figure on the badge.

199
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Master Ju and Master Gui.

200
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,400
Why did my father fight with the two of them?

201
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,720
I think this is a secret between the
Hao Tian Tribe and the Martial Hall.

202
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,580
<i>However,</i>

203
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,500
<i>why didn’t Dad come to see me?</i>

204
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,200
Little San, if you look at this from another perspective,

205
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,520
perhaps your father didn’t leave you at all.

206
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,060
Why?

207
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,300
I heard this from Frander.

208
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,360
When you first came to the school,
Zhao Wu Ji was itchy to fight.

209
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,560
He tested you and your gang personally.

210
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,500
But you used your hidden weapons to defeat him.

211
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,260
You were hurt too, right?

212
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
Did you discover

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,060
what happened to Zhao Wu Ji after that?

214
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,920
Did you forget that

215
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,740
Zhao Wu Ji was covered in bruises the other day?

216
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,680
Frander said

217
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,000
a man with a black attire came that night.

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,140
And he beat Zhao Wu Ji up.

219
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,320
That person didn’t even release his Martial Soul.

220
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,700
That person was your father.

221
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,920
Are you saying that my father
came to see me before?

222
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,660
If I’m not mistaken,

223
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,460
I think he didn’t see you because
he’s afraid it’ll affect your training.

224
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,660
The other reason is

225
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,840
he’s afraid that he can’t bear to leave you

226
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,780
once he meets you.

227
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,860
I think,

228
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,440
he must have something to do.

229
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,780
<i>Dad actually did the same thing to protect me.</i>

230
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
I’m telling you all these things because
I want you to understand...

231
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,940
since you want to be a soul master,

232
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,040
you mustn’t stop.

233
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,420
Your father needs your help too.

234
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,140
You must prove to your father that
you’re capable enough to help him

235
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,480
with your achievements.

236
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,420
<i>Dad, are you really looking after me
in the shadows?</i>

237
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,940
<i>Okay then. I will not disappoint you.</i>

238
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,940
Master, I have two more questions.

239
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,100
Tell me.

240
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,940
For the first question,

241
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,020
do you know who’s my mother?

242
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,960
Your mother’s identity is mysterious.

243
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,900
I’m afraid only a few people
in Soul Land know about her.

244
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,600
Judging from the Blue Silver Plant,

245
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,120
it seems that she does not
belong to any of the major tribes.

246
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,220
Blue Silver Plant is a useless Martial Soul.

247
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,680
But your Blue Silver Plant
is different from others.

248
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,960
Master, for the second question,

249
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,580
Why didn’t you two allow me
to use Hao Tian Hammer?

250
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,260
[Next Episode]
Even after knowing all these facts,

251
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,960
I hope you can keep a normal attitude.

252
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,680
You have six months left.

253
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,340
Actually, I would rather be a blacksmith’s son.

254
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,340
This identity to me is meaningless.

255
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,460
But Xiao Wu didn’t consume
the Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

256
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,520
I’m afraid that...

257
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,860
Brother, don’t you believe in my strength?

258
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,100
I didn’t mean that.

259
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,640
Let’s fight then.

260
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,100
My mother gave it to me.

261
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,320
Mom, this comb is pretty!
