[Previous Episode]
You tortured her husband.

24
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,040
Now, she wants her revenge.

25
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,880
Revenge? Fine, I’ll face her head-on.

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,980
I’ll let them die together!

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,020
Little San, join her.
But don’t kill the beast.

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,880
Brother San, assist me!

29
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,120
Third soul skill, Flying Phoenix!

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Little Ao, what’s your fourth soul skill?

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,840
My fourth soul skill is Stimulate!

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
Those who consume it will get a
10% boost in all stats for five minutes.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,740
Boost in all stats?

34
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,610
[Soul Land]
[Episode 64]

35
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,560
I didn’t even lift a finger and
it’s defeated already?

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,020
Brother San, a Millennium Soul Beast
is not that strong after all.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
This is bad.

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,660
Everyone, be careful.
That’s the ability of the Ghost Tiger.

39
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Shadow Clone.

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,140
Jiubao, reinforced with Amber!

41
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,460
Jiubao Boosts!

42
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,940
First, Strength!

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,120
Second, Speed!

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,980
Third, Soul Power!

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,180
Rong Rong’s third soul skill can
boost their soul powers.

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,960
Now, their soul powers are at

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,920
140% of their strength.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Second soul skill,

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
White Tiger Intense Light Wave!

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
Not bad.

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
But that skill costs Rong Rong’s power a lot.

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,540
It can only last for five to ten minutes.

53
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,760
This is a clone too. Fatty! Xiao Wu!

54
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,560
The one on the left is the real one!
Zhu Qing, be careful!

55
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,700
This is bad!

56
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,420
That tiger picked the weakest spot to attack us.

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,560
First soul skill,

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
Nether Spikes!

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,420
Second soul skill,

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,520
Nether Claws!

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,520
It’s fast!

62
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,220
Fourth soul skill,

63
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,380
White Tiger Meteor Strike!

64
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,220
Although White Tiger Meteor Strike
is not as powerful as Phoenix Strike,

65
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,840
it can lock down the opponent in an instant,

66
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,260
and makes it hard for them to escape.

67
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,800
Seems like the Ghost Tiger
is just a mere distraction.

68
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,500
<i>It’s too fast! I can’t catch up with its speed!</i>

69
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,780
<i>This is bad! Zhu Qing is exhausted
after she unleashed her skills!</i>

70
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,940
First soul skill,

71
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,520
White Tiger Shield!

72
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,700
Are you okay?

73
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,540
Boss Dai!

74
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,700
How dare he!

75
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,780
First soul skill, Arched Body!

76
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,220
Fourth soul skill, Phoenix Strike!

77
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,540
Zhu Qing, do it!

78
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,420
Third soul skill,

79
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,700
Nether Slash!

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,980
Zhu Qing’s Millennium Soul Skill is quite strong.

81
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,100
Yeah. Under Rong Rong’s boost,

82
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,340
I think this is

83
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,800
her strongest attack ever.

84
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Little San, keep away the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower.

85
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,140
Mu Bai, take the soul beast and Zhu Qing
to the poison trap.

86
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,020
Let her absorb its soul ring.

87
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,680
Is that the power of Jiubao Amber Pagoda?

88
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,320
The stronger the soul masters
when she enhances their stats,

89
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
the stronger they will be.

90
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,180
Rong Rong!

91
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,980
This is her first time supporting
soul masters that are stronger than her.

92
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,100
It’s normal for her to be exhausted.

93
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,800
Retreat to the poison trap!

94
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:11,200
[Soul Land]

95
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,580
Retreat!

96
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,380
Little San, that premium herb of yours has great power.

97
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
At least, we didn’t waste our efforts.

98
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,440
The ability and the element of the
Ghost Tiger are suitable for Zhu Qing.

99
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,720
Dean, there are many soul beasts outside.

100
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,960
Some of them are suitable for us.

101
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,700
I created this Flying Godly Claws.

102
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,980
You can catch them with this.

103
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,900
With you, Teacher Zhao
and Teacher Er Long,

104
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,420
I think you can try this out.

105
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,780
<i>Ever since he mentioned the poison trap,</i>

106
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,160
<i>he’s been planning every step.</i>

107
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,460
<i>He’s very meticulous.</i>

108
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,480
<i>Is this because he has the gene of Hao Tian Tribe?</i>

109
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Dean? Do you know how to use it now?

110
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,580
I don’t think it’s hard.

111
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,520
Little San, pick one soul beast out.

112
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,920
We’ll handle it for you.

113
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,120
I think we should help Rong Rong first.

114
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,060
I need to observe them
before I can decide.

115
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,000
Fine.

116
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,140
Xiao Gang,

117
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,740
which soul ring is better for Rong Rong
as her fourth soul ring?

118
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,480
Rong Rong’s skills can boost

119
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,460
speed, strength, and soul power.

120
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,380
For her fourth soul ring, I think
she should get a defensive boost.

121
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,320
I think the 4,000-year-old
pangolin-like soul beast is suitable.

122
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,980
Its main ability is to go near an enemy
and crush them with pure strength.

123
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,180
Its defensive strength is impressive.

124
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,960
I think you three should hunt it
together. Just to be safe.

125
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,840
<i>What a strong defense!</i>

126
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,020
Its weakness is its mouth!

127
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,140
Er Long, there are kids here.

128
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,700
Don’t spill too much blood.

129
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,440
I know that!

130
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,000
I’ll play with this thing for a while.

131
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,360
Rong Rong, close your eyes and come with me.

132
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,800
I’ll go with you.

133
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,360
It’s been so many years,

134
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,380
but Er Long still acts like a little girl.

135
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,240
Little San, have you made your choice yet?

136
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Just tell us. Teacher Zhao and I will handle it for you.

137
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,280
I want that Burrow Demon Spider!

138
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,900
Are you crazy?

139
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,300
That’s a Decade Millennium Soul Beast, you know?

140
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,140
Master, please let me
pick the Burrow Demon Spider.

141
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,380
Listen to me. Choose the
Human-Faced Demon Spider.

142
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,400
It has lived for 6,000 years.

143
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,120
It’s similar to your last soul beast.

144
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
As long as you absorb its soul power,

145
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,960
not only will your third soul skill be improved,

146
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,480
you will also have a defensive fourth soul skill.

147
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Master. To me,

148
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,560
the Burrow Demon Spider is
more useful to me now.

149
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,600
Why?

150
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,640
Master, I picked it because

151
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,800
the Advanced Soul Master
School Contest is coming soon.

152
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,180
If you have time to think of that,

153
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,100
you should think about yourself!

154
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,080
It’s 5,000 years way above your league.

155
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,920
Do you think you can absorb it completely?

156
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,960
Master, believe me. I can do it.

157
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,540
I consumed two premium herbs
when I was at the Old Freak’s place.

158
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,980
They have changed my body completely.

159
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,400
I’m way stronger than you think.

160
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,160
And I have an advantage here too.

161
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,540
The two premium herbs that I have consumed,

162
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,220
allow me to absorb the soul ring

163
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,500
in a special place.

164
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,640
With all that,

165
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,560
I’m confident that I can absorb its power.

166
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,240
Xiao Wu.

167
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,260
Even if you’re 99% sure of it,

168
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,920
I won’t let you take the risk.

169
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,700
Decade Millennium Soul Beasts

170
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,040
are different from the Millennium Soul Beasts.

171
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,460
Let alone the excess power.

172
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,640
Your soul will suffer soul shock when you try to

173
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,300
absorb its energy.
And it’ll be very hard for you.

174
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,040
Soul shock? What’s that?

175
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,260
It’s a phenomenon where
powerful soul beasts produce

176
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,240
special energy before
their souls disappears completely.

177
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,700
Only Decade Millennium Soul Beasts
can cause soul shock.

178
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,720
Soul shock will destroy a person’s mentality.

179
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,460
And it will cause that person to become an idiot.

180
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,920
Xiao Wu, how did you know all that?

181
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,200
My mother told me that.

182
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,140
Soul shock?

183
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,780
Brother, you said you would
protect me forever, right?

184
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,520
I beg you, please listen to Grandmaster.

185
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,660
That Human-Faced Demon Spider is not bad too.

186
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,180
Why must you take the risk?

187
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,660
What if I can avoid soul shock?

188
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,980
Brother!

189
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,780
Did you forget about the Eager Gaze Dew
that I consumed?

190
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,460
With the Purple Demon Eye,

191
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,880
I’m sure

192
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,260
I won’t be affected by soul shock.

193
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,440
I can even reduce the grudges it has towards me.

194
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,560
Brother, are you lying to me?

195
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,800
When did I lie to you before?

196
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,900
Besides,

197
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,359
I won’t risk my life.

198
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,139
I need to stay safe, so that I can protect you.

199
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,260
Okay. You can go.

200
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,400
But, you must remember this.

201
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,420
Brother, if you die,

202
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,760
I will follow your steps.

203
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,470
[Next Episode]

204
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,120
Tang San!

205
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,200
Where’s Little San?

206
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
Where is he?

207
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,960
Dean, Teacher Zhao, please help me.

208
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,180
Little San, have you thought it through?

209
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,040
Fatty!

210
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,180
You want to escape? No way!

211
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,740
Constraint of Spider Web!

212
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,760
Why did that happen?

213
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,100
That dragon flame is
extremely dangerous. Don’t go near it!

214
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
Xiao Wu!

215
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
This is bad!
