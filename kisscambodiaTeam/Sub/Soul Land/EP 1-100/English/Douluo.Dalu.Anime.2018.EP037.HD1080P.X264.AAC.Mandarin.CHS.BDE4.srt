[Previous Episode]

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,490
The battle has ended. San Woo won!

22
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,600
Stop.

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,270
Don’t be fooled by his appearance.

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,860
Kuang Xi and his teammates of Frenzy Battle Team

25
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,000
are all above Level 35.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,160
Every time they take action,
their opponents will either die or get hurt.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,650
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,370
welcome to Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

29
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,400
next will be our fourth round group battle today,

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,450
which is also the most awaited last match.

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,230
At this critical moment...

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,330
[Soul Land]
[Episode 37]

33
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,830
Three, two, one.
The fourth round of Group Soul Battle, begins!

34
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,570
Friends, initiate your martial souls.

35
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,980
Martial Soul Shield Body.

36
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>Kuang Xi’s Martial Soul is a rhino
with great strength.</i>

37
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,140
<i>He’s a typical soul master of Storm Attack Branch.</i>

38
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,010
<i>Boss Dai can handle him.</i>

39
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,010
<i>These two are probably
soul masters of Keen Attack Branch.</i>

40
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,850
<i>Xiao Wu and Zhu Qing can handle them.</i>

41
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,190
<i>These two seem fast, we need to be careful.</i>

42
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,020
<i>Surprisingly, the only one
with a top-level soul ring</i>

43
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,370
<i>is her!</i>

44
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,810
Lucky Disc Defensive Light Blossom.

45
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,010
Lucky Disc Attack Halo Blossom.

46
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,040
<i>Frenzy Battle Team doesn’t
have a soul master of Food Branch.</i>

47
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,630
<i>This means that their strategy is to
end the battle as quick as possible.</i>

48
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,370
<i>They’re confident with
the soul power amplification of</i>

49
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,030
<i>their soul master of Assisting Branch.</i>

50
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,570
<i>You need to pay attention to
this Lucky Disc soul master.</i>

51
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,670
<i>Frenzy Battle Team’s previous battles,</i>

52
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,760
<i>he had played an important role.</i>

53
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,590
Come on.

54
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,570
Frenzy Battle Team.

55
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,020
Such a sturdy net.

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,920
Fatty, in the air. Phoenix Firing Line.

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,510
First soul skill, Phoenix Firing Line.

58
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,250
Qibao famously said...

59
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,160
<i>At this small difference of level,</i>

60
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,870
<i>Qibao Amber Pagoda’s amplification effect</i>

61
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,420
<i>is far greater than other Martial Souls.</i>

62
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,230
<i>It’s the most powerful Martial Soul
of Assisting Branch.</i>

63
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,020
What? Gosh, assisting position is vacant.

64
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,120
Rong Rong and Oscar are being attacked.

65
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,980
<i>They target them since the beginning.</i>

66
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,480
<i>Attacking the weakest soul masters of
Assisting Branch and Food Branch at the beginning</i>

67
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,450
<i>to eliminate all uncertain factors,</i>

68
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,860
<i>is the ultimate law of battle.</i>

69
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,670
<i>Speaking of the ultimate law of battle,</i>

70
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,620
<i>that means we can use this same factor</i>

71
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,070
<i>to create a trap.</i>

72
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,270
Second soul skill,
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

73
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,360
Third soul skill, Constraint of Spider Web.

74
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,400
Twin Monkey retreats, protect
Lucky Disc. Twin Sheep withstand it.

75
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,360
<i>Blue Silver Plant.</i>

76
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>Let’s break this spider web first.</i>

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,240
Your opponent is me.

78
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,430
<i>In terms of poison,
my spider poison has never met an enemy.</i>

79
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,600
Unbelievable, Shrek Seven Devils
are leading the battle.

80
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,310
Is Frenzy Battle Team’s
seven-victory record going to an end?

81
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,810
Fatty.

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,750
Oh, attack the soul master of Assisting Branch.

83
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,430
Who is this Lucky Disc?

84
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,560
<i>Little San, Zhu Qing.</i>

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,910
<i>If there’s a chance,
eliminate this Lucky Disc at once.</i>

86
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,120
<i>We must not let him use that skill.</i>

87
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,360
Third soul skill, Fanatic.

88
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,500
<i>Oh, no.</i>

89
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,680
It’s here!

90
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,510
The key to Frenzy Battle Team’s
countless table-turning-success,

91
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,110
Fanatic.

92
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,910
- Release.
- Can Shrek Seven Devils

93
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,310
endure this counterattack
from Frenzy Battle Team?

94
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,600
Second soul skill, Trample.

95
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,380
Boss Dai!
<i>Their power has amplified greatly.</i>

96
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,070
<i>Their speed has elevated immensely too.</i>

97
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,740
Gather.

98
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,990
Admit your defeat.

99
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,050
In the state of Fanatic, we don’t feel pain.

100
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,560
Every attribute increases by fifteen percent.

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,960
Admit defeat? In your dreams.

102
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,510
If there is no Qibao Amber soul master,

103
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,520
do you think I’ll waste my time talking?

104
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,600
If that so, don’t blame us for being cruel.

105
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,630
Airborne.

106
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,930
They’re able to fly too?

107
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,330
<i>Master is right.</i>

108
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,310
<i>We must take down Lucky Disc
soul master since the start.</i>

109
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,410
<i>We’ve misjudged.</i>

110
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,800
You thought we can’t perform
the long-distance attack?

111
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,200
Everyone, disperse.

112
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,570
<i>Smart.</i>

113
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,590
Little San, what shall we do now?

114
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,610
Mushroom Sausage is only valid for a minute.

115
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,220
Moreover, Little Ao can only fly for half a minute.

116
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,090
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

117
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>Ghostly Trace.</i>

118
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,140
Nice.

119
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,700
<i>This degree is too mere to hurt us.</i>

120
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,160
Try this then.

121
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,360
Dangerous!

122
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,460
Rong Rong.

123
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,610
[Soul Land]

124
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,500
Gather.

125
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,940
Fatty.

126
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,500
<i>If only one or two of them can fly,</i>

127
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
<i>that means they have an airborne soul master.</i>

128
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
<i>But seven of them to fly at once,</i>

129
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,390
<i>means that they use a soul master’s soul skill</i>

130
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,860
<i>of Assisting Branch or Food Branch.</i>

131
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,410
<i>This soul skill can’t last long.</i>

132
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,410
Their abilities have amplified greatly,

133
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,930
probably due to the soul master’s
millennium soul skill of Assisting Branch.

134
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,350
But you see, except for the female soul master,

135
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,680
everyone has lost their mind.

136
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,740
According to Master’s research,

137
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,970
their Fanatic state won’t last long.

138
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,280
After the Fanatic state ends,
they’ll undergo negative feedback.

139
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,690
We can’t handle them in the current state.

140
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,240
Little Ao, how many Mushroom Sausage can you make?

141
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,350
I don’t have much soul power left,

142
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,460
I can make one at most.

143
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,960
You can’t hold on.

144
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,880
Later, after your flying ability ends,

145
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,270
Go down immediately.

146
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,510
I’ll do it, Little San.

147
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,050
No, I should do this.
I still have my trump card.

148
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,680
Even if their Fanatic state

149
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,430
can last longer than I thought,

150
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,110
I can still leave the battle site.

151
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,450
Since I’m leading this battle,
you should listen to me.

152
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,480
<i>Little San is betting,</i>

153
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,160
<i>he’s betting that Oscar’s Mushroom Sausage
can last longer than Fanatic.</i>

154
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,060
<i>Frenzy Battle Team is betting too.</i>

155
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,000
But what if when we land,

156
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,520
they’re still in this state?

157
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,820
We can only bet.

158
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,970
We’re indeed hoping for a victory.

159
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,450
But everyone’s safety is more important.

160
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,360
Their flying ability has ended.

161
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,900
If they land outside the ring, they will lose.

162
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,690
Flying Mushroom Sausage.

163
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,280
I’m sorry, I’ll go down first.

164
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,200
Only one left, we’re going to win for sure.

165
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,250
The flying time has ended.

166
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,970
You have no chance to win.

167
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,800
In a group battle, a defeat means
every team member is taken down.

168
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,140
Now, Shrek Seven Devils have one member left.

169
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,800
One against six, does he hold a chance?

170
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,890
Aren’t you leaving?

171
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,520
Although I’m the only one left,

172
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,170
yet to win or to lose is uncertain.

173
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,070
<i>Their Fanatic state has ended.</i>

174
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,980
One against six, you don’t stand a chance.

175
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,880
In Frenzy Battle Team,

176
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,270
you’re the only one to fight, right?

177
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,270
The negative feedback from Fanatic

178
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,110
has made your teammates
lost their fighting abilities.

179
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,140
Shrek Seven Devils are going to turn the table.

180
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,830
Turn the table? You?

181
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>After the Fanatic state,
their abilities have become weaker.</i>

182
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,460
<i>I still stand a chance.</i>

183
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,550
Even with my human body,
I can easily crush you into bits.

184
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,770
<i>Ghostly Trace.</i>

185
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,490
<i>It’s time.</i>

186
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,680
<i>I just need to sweep you off the ring.</i>

187
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,130
<i>I’m being pulled in, how is this possible?</i>

188
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,880
Why?

189
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,210
My third soul ring is
Millennium Human Faced Demon Spider.

190
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,720
Human Faced Demon Spider?

191
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,410
This battle has ended.

192
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,820
Shrek Seven Devils won!

193
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,950
Can you tell me your name?

194
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,020
One of Shrek Seven Devils,
Thousand Hands Asura.

195
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,040
Brother, you’re so cool!

196
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,220
Xiao Wu, get down.

197
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
Today, we have a great victory.

198
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,640
We must have a good meal.
Let’s go. Meal on me.

199
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,990
Brother, how generous you are!

200
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,000
Let’s go.

201
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,880
Let’s go, catch up.

202
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,710
[Next Episode]
To be honest,

203
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,540
three days ago, a soul master team came

204
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,420
and caused a big loss to the Soul Arena.

205
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,120
This Silver Soul Battle Team
is like Shrek Seven Devils,

206
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,420
they’re a team with top-level soul rings.

207
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,560
Sir,

208
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,040
I hereby invite Shrek Seven Devils
to join the group battle

209
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,520
at the Central Soul Arena.

210
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,950
Xiao Gang,

211
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,250
you shouldn’t promise them this quick.

212
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,810
You must not admit defeat until the last moment.
