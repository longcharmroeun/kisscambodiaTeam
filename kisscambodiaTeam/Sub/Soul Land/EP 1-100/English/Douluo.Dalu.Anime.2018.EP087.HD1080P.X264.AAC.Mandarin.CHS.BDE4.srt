[Previous Episode]

24
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,760
As long as Tang San
from Controlling Branch isn’t here,

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,620
soul masters of Controlling Branch
can restrain other soul masters.

26
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,480
Shrek School isn’t that good after all.

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,620
The winner of this qualifying round is

28
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,160
Shrek School.

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,800
They’ve won seven times in a row.

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,860
This is Martial Soul restraint.

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,260
Tang San, I would like to talk to you.

32
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,120
[Soul Land]
[Episode 87]

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,460
Brother, just now...

34
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,840
Huo Wu insisted that I have saved her,

35
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,180
and she wanted to return me a favor, so...

36
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,500
Brother, look at me.

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,700
I’ve grabbed it, so others don’t have to
keep thinking about it.

38
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,700
Tang San.

39
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,740
Coming right up, Shrek School.

40
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,500
They have won ten times consecutively.

41
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,840
Up to this point, we have won
11 times consecutively.

42
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,940
We’re in the first place
together with Shen Feng School.

43
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,180
But the last three rounds will be very tough.

44
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,280
Especially two strong opponents,

45
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,020
Shen Feng School and Lei Ting School,
which we didn’t meet in preliminary rounds.

46
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,820
We’re fighting Lei Ting School today.

47
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,900
Their overall strength is
higher than Chi Huo School.

48
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,260
They can even specifically restrain
Tian Shui School and School of Florals.

49
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,180
The only match they lost,

50
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,900
was the one against Shen Feng School.

51
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,460
Master, let me join the match today.

52
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Little San, your Blue Silver Plant
is immune to water and fire,

53
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,060
but it’s not immune to lightning.

54
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,160
It’ll even be restrained
when facing Lightning Martial Soul.

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,980
Because your Blue Silver Plant
isn’t completely insulated.

56
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,040
If you’re injured or defeated today,

57
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,420
if we face Shen Feng School tomorrow,

58
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,080
the chance of victory will be greatly reduced.

59
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,200
So I’ll be kept to fight Shen Feng School?

60
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,620
I’ve observed the strength
of Shen Feng School in detail.

61
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,080
Among the Five Elements Schools,

62
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,740
they’re no doubt the strongest team.

63
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,920
In order to defeat them, you have to give your best.

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,620
You must have faith
in your partners in today’s match.

65
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,920
I’ll announce the list of participants.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,100
The sequence is Tai Long, Jing Ling,
Huang Yuan, Xiao Wu, Dai Mu Bai,

67
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,640
Zhu Zhu Qing, Ma Hong Jun.

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,780
Is there any question?

69
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,380
No.

70
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,140
Don’t worry, Little San.
Let us handle this round.

71
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,260
We’ll count on you
to fight Shen Feng School.

72
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,400
Alright.

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,000
Shrek, wins!

74
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,280
This is the first match between
Shrek School and Lei Ting School.

75
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,840
Under Lu Chen’s strong attack,

76
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,260
can Tai Long only defend passively?

77
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,900
Tai Long, the trick for you
against Lei Ting School

78
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,240
is one word, delay.

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,880
Use your defence skill

80
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,220
to delay until the opponent’s
soul power is exhausted.

81
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,140
<i>The attack of lightning is so strong.
Can Tai Long take it?</i>

82
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,400
What an awesome attack.
Congratulations, Shrek School.

83
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,640

Can he win this round for Lei Ting School?

87
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960

88
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,320
<i>The weather is worsening.</i>

89
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,980
<i>Tai Long is trapped by him again.</i>

90
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,400
<i>Could this be...</i>

91
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Kill!

92
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,900
Tai Long.

93
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,060
Trust him. Tai Long is a descendant of Li Tribe.

94
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
<i>Such an insignificant Soul Honor</i>

95
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,110

Fourth round. Shrek School is sending Jing Ling.

What would he bring into play?

102
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,540
<i>Tai Long’s performance
is more outstanding than I expected.</i>

103
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,240
<i>Although he has won,</i>

104
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,560
<i>Lei Jiu Chong’s soul power has been depleted.</i>

105
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,580
Start!

106
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,660
<i>Jing Ling, as a soul master
of Keen Attack Branch,</i>

107
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,540
<i>has the biggest advantage of speed.</i>

108
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,660
<i>Your trick consists of only one word,</i>

109
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,460
<i>hide.</i>

110
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,760
Let’s see how long you can hide.

111
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,240
Fourth round, Shrek School won.

112

Third soul skill, Wings of Lightning.

136

Fourth soul skill, Lightning Eagle.

137
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,920
<i>The flying ability of Lei Tian can
restrain soul masters who attack close.</i>

138
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,060
<i>Such height is beyond
the attacking area of the opponent.</i>

139
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,040
<i>Yet the opponent is still not taking action.</i>

140
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,640
<i>When Lei Tian is done reserving
the energy and lock the target,</i>

141
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,340
<i>you can’t escape even if you try.</i>

142
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,360
Lightning Eagle Shield Body.

143
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,780
My Lightning Eagle has covered
the range of your Teleport.

144
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,160
You can’t escape.

145
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,680
- Eagle eyes locked on.
- Third soul skill, Teleport.

146
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,200
What? She’s gone?

147
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,620
<i>Rapid speed. I can’t lock in time.</i>

148
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,180
<i>Lei Tian is surrounded by lightning.
I can’t get close.</i>

149
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,140
Let’s see how you can hide
from my attack in the air.

150
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,380
Second soul skill, Charm.

151
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,040
The opponent is using
the strongest soul skill right away.

152
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,020
He probably wants to settle this quick.

153
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,900
But it’s too energy-depleting. He’s tricked by Xiao Wu.

154
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,300
The guidance I gave Xiao Wu is the word, dodge.

155
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,340
Xiao Wu has handled the match quite well.

156
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,340
She unsparingly used
her third soul skill, Teleport.

157
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,280
It forced Lightning Eagle
to be distracted.

158
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,620
Hence, she was able to mesmerize the opponent.

159
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,320
Shrek School won the seventh round.

160
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,020
Good one, Shrek School.

161
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,040
I didn’t expect them to defeat
Lei Ting School so easily.

162
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,520
Your Majesty, could you tell

163
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,060
why Shrek School can win continuously?

164
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,700
Of course, because of their strength.

165
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,920
Your Majesty, you’re half right.
Strength is surely important.

166
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,360
But one can’t achieve
such level just with strength.

167
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,560
The key to Shrek’s advantage

168
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,240
is their strategy and team arrangement.

169
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,340
According to what you two said,
this is no coincidence.

170
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,200
With that person, how is this a coincidence?

171
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,040
The choice of the Pope is indeed right.

172
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,180
That person has studied
Martial Soul profoundly.

173
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,520
No wonder he’s made the Honourary Elder.

174
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,020
Chief Salas, what do you mean?

175
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,300
Why don’t Your Majesty ask Chief Ning?

176
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,900
I shall leave now.

177
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,420
Your Majesty, this person is Tang San’s teacher.

178
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,000
The Grandmaster from the tribe
of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,160
He has become the Honourary Elder of
Martial Soul Hall at about Level 30.

180
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,380
His profound study of Martial Soul

181
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,720
made me ashamed of my inferiority.

182
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,200
Chief Ning is giving high praise to the Grandmaster.

183
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,320
Your Majesty, those who have Grandmaster
have the world.

184
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,520
It seems like I should meet this Grandmaster.

185
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,000
Chief Ning, please arrange it
after the qualifying rounds.

186
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,380
Your Majesty, if you would like
to solicit Grandmaster, start with Tang San.

187
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,040
Only this disciple
that he cares the most

188
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,860
can decide his direction.

189
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,680
Next, Vice Captain of Lei Ting School,
Lei Dong.

190
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,580
A Soul Sect of Controlling Branch at Level 43.

191
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,880
A very strong opponent.

192
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,140
How would Shrek School respond?

193
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,740
Eighth round, begins.

194
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,300
Little San, pay attention to Lei Dong’s battle.

195
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,760
He has spider type Martial Soul.

196
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,380
Since your third and fourth soul rings
are originated from spiders,

197
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,040
so is your soul bone,

198
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,660
his battle method may inspire you.

199
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,400
He closed eyes.

200
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,200
It seems he’s taking precautions
against Xiao Wu’s Charm.

201
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,780
Third soul skill, Web of Lightning.

202
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,800
<i>From the look of its form,</i>

203
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,030
<i>Lei Dong’s Martial Soul, Lightning Spider,</i>

204
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,620
<i>is similar to Eight Spider Bone.</i>

205
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,660
<i>Eight Spider Bone is venomous.</i>

206
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,100
<i>It works well with Blue Silver Plant.</i>

207
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,600
<i>It has a balanced attack and defence power.</i>

208
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,400
<i>Lightning Spider is controlled
with the help of current flow.</i>

209
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>Its attacking power is stronger.</i>

210
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,760
<i>The Web of Lightning is like his eyes,</i>

211
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,360
<i>having the movement of the arena in hand.</i>

212
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,760
<i>Xiao Wu, you must be careful.</i>

213
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,660
<i>What?</i>

214
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,960
<i>How can this be?
The Web of Lightning is sort of sucking.</i>

215
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,060
<i>But my soul power isn’t enough
for continuous Teleport.</i>

216
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,140
<i>What should I do?</i>

217
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,840
First soul skill, Silk of Lightning.

218
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,540
I finally get the chance.
Take my first soul skill, Arched Body.

219
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,640
She escaped from Lei Tian’s attack just now.

220
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,980
She hasn’t experienced
the power of lightning.

221
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,700
<i>Impossible. You’ve penetrated
the Web of Lightning.</i>

222
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,380
<i>Your body should be numb.</i>

223
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,720
<i>Your Web of Lightning can
attack strongly but defense weakly.</i>

224
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
<i>The core is the weakest part
of the lightning.</i>

225
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,460
<i>If this keeps going, I’ll be screwed
when she closes up.</i>

226
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>I have to use my fourth soul skill.</i>

227
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,620
Activate. Fourth soul skill,
God Locking Ring.

228
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,400
[Next Episode]
Boss Dai, count on you now.

229
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,120
Don’t stop me.

230
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,900
Dai Mu Bai, you have to pay for
what you’ve done.

231
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,340
I left home to Tian Dou Empire,

232
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,200
so I can make myself stronger.

233
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
I can’t lose.

234
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,800
We surrender.

235
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,940
If that’s the case, we’ll decide
the victory with one match.

236
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,420
Everyone trusts you.

237
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,360
Tang San, I admire you.

238
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,960
But I must defeat you today.
