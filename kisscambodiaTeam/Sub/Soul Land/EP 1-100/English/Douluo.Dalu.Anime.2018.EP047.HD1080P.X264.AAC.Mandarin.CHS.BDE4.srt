Fine.

22
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,640
Shrek School doesn’t want to trouble you.

23
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,650
Let’s bid farewell here, fellow seniors.

24
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,470
Dean Frander.

25
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,980
Dai was right.

26
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,500
Let’s re-run Shrek School.

27
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,600
None of us would want to see it end like this.

28
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,180
Yes.

29
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,900
Okay. Shrek School will not end.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 47]

31
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,930
Lanba School. I know something about it.

32
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,020
It’s located in Tian Dou City.

33
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,040
I heard that the teaching of
this school is quite strict.

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
Moreover, it has a specialty.

35
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,540
They only accept civilian students
and reject all nobles.

[Recruitment]

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,180
Very soon, they can compete
with Tian Dou Imperial School.

38
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,650
Let’s start.

39
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,060
I am Qin Ming.

40
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,260
War Soul Emperor of
Storm Attack Branch at Level 62.

41
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,660
Martial Soul, Fiery Grey Wolf.

42
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,100
I’m here to apply for a teacher position.
Please advise.

43
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,420
You don’t have to undergo evaluation.

44
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,480
The school rule states
that a soul master above Level 60

45
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,740
can exempt additional tests.

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,710
Since there’s no need for
additional tests for above Level 60,

47
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,290
we don’t have to waste time.

48
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,520

Of course, yes.

Storm Attack Branch at Level 54.

70
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,880
I couldn’t rate your grades, fellow seniors.

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,220
Why not allow me to lead you to our Dean?

72
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,370
Let her decide your grades and payment.

73
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,740
Let’s go.

74
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,040
Don’t your Dean stay in the school area?

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,720
Dean likes peace.

76
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,850
She usually stays alone in the forest.

77
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,750
The daily affairs of the school are
managed by the teachers.

78
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,710
Only big issues need to refer to the Dean.

79
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,380
I see.

80
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,900
<i>This voice.</i>

Xiao Gang. When can you stop avoiding?

82
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,900
It’s been 20 years.
Can you bare that not to visit her?

83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,970
Dean, these are soul masters
who come to apply for a job in our school.

84
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,220
Six of them have soul power above Level 60.

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,580
We couldn’t decide it.
So, we need you to make the decision.

86
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,600
Xiao Gang. Is that really you?

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,080
Am I dreaming?

88
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,470
Sister Er Long, I didn’t know you were here.

89
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,580
We haven’t met for years. How are you?

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,710
Boss Fu, we haven’t seen for years.
You still look the same.

91
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,940
I’m getting old.

92
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,580
Come on. Let me introduce.

93
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,650
These are teachers and students
from Shrek School.

94
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,800
We saw the recruitment notice of
your school coincidentally.

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,980
So, we come here to ask for a living.

96
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,660
She is Liu Er Long.

97
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,490
She’s the one who followed Grandmaster and me

98
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,780
wandering around the soul masters’ world.

99
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,980
She’s the third in the Golden Iron Triangle.

100
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,860
The Killing Point.

101
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,790
Aren’t you letting us in?

102
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,260
Boss Fu.

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,360
Can my hut fit so many people?

104
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,670
What happened to you?

105
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,380
Since when have you fallen to this point?

106
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,030
It’s a long story.

107
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,540
What a Tian Dou Imperial School.

108
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,450
How dare they bully Boss Fu!

109
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,080
Boss Fu, don’t say it anymore!

110
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,130
My place is also your place!

111
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,620
Everyone can stay on.

112
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,390
This will be your place.

113
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,910
Our requirements on our part are very high.

114
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,490
Can you bear it?

115
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,130
Payment?

116
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,510
This is your problem now, Boss Fu.

117
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,570
You are the boss of Golden Iron Triangle.

118
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,140
From now on, this school is yours.

119
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,170
Tomorrow I will hold a faculty meeting

120
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,980
to announce that
the school will change its name to Shrek School.

121
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,900
Teacher Yin Shu.

122
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,420
Please announce a meeting to be held
tomorrow with all teachers and students.

123
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,090
These are my friends.

124
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,760
Let the canteen prepare
a feast on the second floor.

125
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,380
Yes, Dean.

126
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,340
No. I am the Deputy Dean now.

127
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,540
Xiao Gang, are you still going to remain silent?

128
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,540
I remembered.

129
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,930
We haven’t eaten for a whole day.

130
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,900
Little San, let’s go out for a walk.

131
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,220
Okay.

132
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,720
[Soul Land]

133
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,300
Aren’t you afraid that he will run away again?

134
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,810
Boss Fu, do you think he can still run away

135
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,810
after I see him again?

136
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,170
Little San, do you want to ask

137
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,920
the relationship between Er Long and me?

138
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,710
Why do we end up this now?

139
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,260
Why did I avoid her for 20 years?

140
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,130
Let me tell you a story.

141
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,200
Okay.

142
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,580
More than twenty years ago,

143
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,100
a young man with a famous background

144
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,820
was rejected by his family
due to his Martial Soul mutation.

145
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,480
In order to prove himself,
he left his clan for studies.

146
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,100
He hoped that he could be recognized by
the world and his clansmen.

147
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,220
When he traveled abroad,

148
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,130
he met a young soul master with good strength.

149
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,610
They became friends and
went out into the soul masters’ world.

150
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,380
One day, they met a pretty girl
in the soul beasts forest.

151
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,610
The girl soon attracted the young men
with a lively and cheerful personality.

152
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,330
Three of them became good friends
and adventured together.

153
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,980
As time went on,

154
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,070
two young men fell for the girl
who owned Fire Dragon Martial Soul.

155
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,960
But, neither of them wanted to show it.

156
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,210
Especially the one who lacked powerful
strength due to Martial Soul mutation.

157
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:38,080
Soon, they made a name of Golden Iron Triangle
in the soul masters’ world.

158
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,020
Feelings

159
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,500
can be accumulated over time.

160
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,060
The deeper it hid,

161
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,450
the stronger it would be.

162
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,710
Finally one day,

163
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,750
the young man with good strength
proposed to the girl.

164
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,740
The girl rejected him.

165
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,570
She loved the young man with weak strength

166
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,980
who liked to study theoretical knowledge.

167
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,880
You should have guessed it.

168
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,510
The girl was Er Long.

169
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,030
The two young men were Frander and me.

170
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,240
When I heard the true feeling from Er Long,

171
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,390
I suddenly felt the happiness
I had never had in my life.

172
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,660
Frander withdrew from
this relationship readily.

173
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,060
He said that he wanted to be my brother

174
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,490
and Er Long would be his sister-in-law.

175
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,800
Dean Frander is a good man.

176
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,420
This may be the best ending.

177
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,260
If everything went smoothly,

178
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,870
this may be the best ending.

179
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,260
But, fate is always so cruel.

180
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,470
God’s teasing

181
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,990
turned all happiness in vain.

182
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,840
I remembered very clearly that day.

183
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,130
The stars were exceptionally bright.

184
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,610
Frander hosted our marriage.

185
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,630
Er Long and I finally got married.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,010
At that time, we felt so happy.

187
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,740
The story should end like this.

188
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,520
But at that time,

189
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,430
an uninvited guest came to our wedding.

190
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,540
My second uncle, the second owner of
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Family,

191
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,260
Yu Luo Mian.

192
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,860
However, he didn’t come to me.

193
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,960
He came for my newlywed bride, Er Long.

194
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,190
What? Why?

195
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,920
It’s because Er Long, my wife

196
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,230
is my second uncle’s illegitimate daughter,

197
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,720
which means she is my cousin.

198
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,290
At that time, I ran out crazily.

199
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,430
Er Long wanted to chase after me

200
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,800
but she was forcibly stopped by my second uncle.

201
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,590
At that time, I only wanted to die.

202
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,140
Frander came to stop me.

203
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,050
But, my heart was dead.

204
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,640
Being disheartened,

205
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,040
I could only escape

206
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,330
and leave alone.

207
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,540
After that, Frander told me that

208
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,220
Er Long had fallen out with my second uncle

209
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,340
and went around to look for me.

210
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,140
I wanted to see her so much.

211
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:31,150
But, I couldn’t see her.

212
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,260
Master, is the secular viewpoint so important?

213
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,650
Aunty Er Long has waited for you for so many years.

214
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,570
If you continue to avoid it,

215
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,420
both of you will only suffer.

216
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,890
No. It’s unfair to Er Long.

217
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,020
When you love someone,
you don’t have to own her.

218
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:15,310
I hope she could live happily.

219
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,980
He is right.

220
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,730
Xiao Gang, I don’t care about the secular viewpoint.

221
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,270
I don’t need justice.

222
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,010
I just wish to be with you.

223
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,490
[Next Episode]

224
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,580
Who is it?

225
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,190
That’s bad, Little San might be in trouble.
Hurry and have a look.

226
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,160
Stop pretending if you’re awake.

227
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,630
Kid, aren’t you afraid of death?

228
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,810
<i>I didn’t expect that I’d be killed by someone
who uses useless poison.</i>

229
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,180
<i>It’s so unworthy.</i>
