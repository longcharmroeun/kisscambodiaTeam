I’ll play with you guys today.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,160
You aren’t strong enough, little girl.

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me show you my power then.

24
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,820
You’re still not strong enough.

29
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,470
Good monkey, you’re really keen.

30
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,040
This is how you want to buy time.

31
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,440
It won’t be so easy.

32
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,410
Increase gravity.

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,470
<i>What a strong soul skill.</i>

34
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,570
Where can you run?

35
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,400
Dangerous.

36
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,500
<i>I’ll surely take this child.</i>

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,700
<i>But this exam should end now.</i>

38
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,040
<i>What does this mean?</i>

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>It’s about to end, little monkey.</i>

40
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,240
<i>Could this be Teacher Zhao’s...</i>

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,230
This is my fourth soul skill.

42
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,300
You won’t be able to escape,

Parasitic Haunted Vine.

47
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,550
<i>It’s the Haunted Vine.</i>

48
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,100
<i>It grew from inside of the body.
Could this be...</i>

49
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,940
Haunted Vine is
a century soul beast,

50
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,980
but its toughness surpasses
those of thousand years old.

51
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,070
Perhaps Teacher Zhao can’t set himself free so easily.

52
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,940
<i>It’s so strong.</i>

53
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,300
<i>It’s poisonous.</i>

54
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,970
<i>Here’s a good chance.</i>

55
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,050

<i>Decade Millennium Soul Skill is so scary.</i>

59
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,460
<i>You can use my skill to strike back.</i>

60
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,310
In such a passive condition,

61
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,330
Tang San can strike back all of a sudden.

62
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,230
What a stunning speed.

63
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,420
<i>You want castrate me? That’s too much.</i>

64
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,350
Are you a hedgehog?

65
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,430
Such a small hammer. I’ll give you a lesson.

66
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,230
Thank you.

67
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,750
Oscar, come here. There’s business for you.

68
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Boss Dai, are you asking for me?

69
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,050
Make us some sausages. They’re injured.

70
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,410
No problem. Five copper soul coin each.

71
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,350
Don’t forget to pay me.

72
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,770
Super Recovery Big Sausage.

73
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,080
Eat it. Although the way he talks is disgusting,

74
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,410
his sausage has great effect.

75
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,210
This will increase the speed of your recovery.

76
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,680
I’m not badly injured, just a little exhausted.

77
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,450
I’ll just need some rest.

78
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,440
Give the sausage to the others.

79
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,400
Oscar,

80
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,470
come here.

81
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,910
Sausage，

82
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,030
little sausage

83
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,540
give me one each.

84
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,440
Who are you?

85
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,370
Why are you in Shrek School?

86
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,740
You even know my name.

87
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,670
Rotter,

88
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,920

90
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,970
It’s really embarrassing today.

91
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,520
Tasty Little Sausage.

92
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,850
Don’t worry.

93
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,330
I’ll not let you eat his sausages.

94
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,850
How could I?

95
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,610
Teacher Zhao,

96
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,120
did we pass?

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,140

98
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,270
Yes, you passed.

99
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,690
Hmm.

100
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,600
Teacher Zhao,

101
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,640
hold on.

102
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,170
Little hedgehog,

103
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,570
what’s up?

104
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,670
You’ve passed my test.

105
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,640
Teacher Zhao,

106
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,390
sorry.

107
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,110
I was too reckless.

108
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,740
But your capability is too strong to me.

109
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,040
I have no choice but to give it all in.

110
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,260
Let me help you remove the hidden weapons in you.

111
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,370
Or else,

112
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,940
it may affect your body.

113
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,690
Mu Bai.

114
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,590
You arrange accommodation for them.

115
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,010
The class starts tomorrow.

116
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,090
Don’t touch these weapons
on the floor that Tang San left.

117
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,160
They’re poisonous.

118
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,040
Have him tidy them up when he’s awake.

119
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,730
What’s going on with Teacher Zhao today?

120
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,650
Why is he mad with the new students?

121
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,390
I dare you to speak louder,

122
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,200
so that Teacher Zhao hears it.

123
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,270
He must be very angry now.

124
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,810
Who would he vent it to?

125
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,410
Let’s help them settle down first.

126
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,870
Why are you guys carrying the beauties,

127
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
yet I’m carrying a man?

128
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,340
Because you’re Uncle Sausage.

129
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,950
Ah!

130
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,720
I’m really unfortunate

131
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,270
to meet such a little hedgehog.

132
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,730
If it was back then...

133
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,480
Ah...

134
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,810
No more about the past.

135
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,990
It seems

136
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,620
I have to teach him well.

137
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,560
One must be put through the mill

138
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,120
to be successful.

139
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,150
<i>Zhao Wu Ji.</i>

140
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,150
Who is it?

141
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,040
<i>Come out.</i>

142
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,340
Come out.

143
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,210
I know you’re here.

144
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,480
Who are you?

145
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,700
Meeting Acala in such an insignificant place.

146
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,950
I haven’t stretched for awhile.

147
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,870
I want to fight with you.

148
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,770
The Grand Soul Land Master.

149
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,160
May I know which senior is here?

150
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,200
Stop fooling around with me.

151
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,330
During the day,

152
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,660
didn’t you have fun

153
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,350
bullying those kids?

154
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,870
I realize

155
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,920
that it must feel great to bully someone.

156
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,650
Let me bully you as well.

157
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,780
Of course.

158
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,760
You may think that

159
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,650
I’m bullying the weak.

160
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,290
<i>Who is this person?</i>

161
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,750
Since you are here,

162
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,300
just show up.

163
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,850
One or two,

164
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,790
there’s no difference.

165
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,550
Boss,

166
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,720
this senior...

167
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,300
Greetings, Lord Hao Tian.

168
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,530
Save the courtesy.

169
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,390
I came to look for trouble.

170
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,570
Martial Soul of Owl,

171
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,110
Level 78.

172
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,850
You’re indeed the main attacker
of Golden Iron Triangle, Frander.

173
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,800
Is Shrek School yours?

174
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,560
Yes,

175
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,300
my Lord.

176
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,940
How did Zhao Wu Ji offend you, my Lord?

177
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,370
Can you forgive him for my sake?

178
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,400
Stop the nonsense.

179
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,140
Stand aside.

180
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,640
Or I will hit you as well.

181
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,890
Zhao Wu Ji,

182
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,340
I’ll give you a chance.

183
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,210
I’ll not use any Martial Soul.

184
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,160
If you can withstand for half an hour,

185
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,670
I’ll leave right away.

186
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,900
Or else,

187
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,430
you’ll have to do something for me.

188
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,960
Lord Hao Tian.

189
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,690
I don’t understand how I offended you.

190
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,390
Can you

191
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,460
clear this up, please?

192
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,750
So...

193
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,650
I can die knowing why.

194
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,080
Ha!

195
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,520
Do I even need to explain?

196
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,690
You hit the young one.

197
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,780
The older one will of course ask for justice.

198
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,460
This is an unquestionable principle.

199
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,780
Let’s begin.

200
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,020
Ah...

201
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Ah...

202
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,400
[Next Episode]

203
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,630
It’s my fault yesterday.

204
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,430
I didn’t protect you well.

205
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,790
The teacher was too powerful.

206
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,810
How can I blame you?

207
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:31,680
No.

208
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,650
Don’t.

209
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,670
Stop it.

210
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,630
Please stop disturbing this lady.

211
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,680
Who do you think you are?

212
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,920
You’re also a soul master.

213
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,780
No wonder you dare to interrupt me.

214
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,130
I’ll show you what’s actual strength.
