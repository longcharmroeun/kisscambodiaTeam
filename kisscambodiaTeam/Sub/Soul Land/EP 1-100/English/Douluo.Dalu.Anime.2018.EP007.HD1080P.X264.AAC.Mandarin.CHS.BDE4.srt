[Previous Episode]

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,190
Do you want to discuss it?

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,830
Yes, I’m here.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,750
Are you convinced?

24
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,370
What are you doing?

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,990
Isn’t this a friendly fight?

26
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,170
Hit your right shoulder.

27
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,810
Left calf, right calf.

28
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,890
How dare you hit me with stone!

29
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,290
You lose this time.

30
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,970
Come again!

31
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,850
You still want?

32
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,930
All right.

33
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,920
Come again!

34
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,960
Master, where can we find soul beasts?

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
This is for you.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,540
Thank you.

37
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,090
I’ve been using this belt for thirty years
but I never gave it a name.

38
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,350
You give it a name.

39
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,350
I’ll call it Twenty-Four Moonlight Bridges.

40
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,710
Not everyone can enter the Soul Hunting Forest.

41
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,090
Only soul master who receives warrant
from Martial Soul Hall...

42
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,210
can enter the forest and hunt for soul beasts.

43
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,870
From now on,

44
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,010
don’t leave my side, not even a single step.

45
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,780
Yes.

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,370
[Soul Land]
[Episode 7]

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,180
Come out,

48
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,290
Little San, this is my Martial Soul.
Luo San Pao.

49
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,230
You can call it Luo San Pao.

50
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,370
You can also call it San Pao.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,320
Master, this is your Martial Soul?

52
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,600
Isn’t the usual expression of
Martial Soul possession?

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,260
Why is it...

54
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,860
Because my Martial Soul
is a Mutated Martial Soul.

55
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,410
Do you remember
the Mutated Martial Soul I told you?

56
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,890
San Pao is the one.

57
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,350
But its mutation is towards a bad direction.

58
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,550
When it just awakened,

59
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,370
my soul power was only at half rank.

60
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,200
Otherwise, it wouldn’t be like this.

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,990
No matter how hard I try,

62
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,930
my soul power would never exceed Level 30.

63
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,210
After all, I can only study Martial Soul in theory.

64
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>Master is so persistent on Martial Soul
but San Pao...</i>

65
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,310
Master, I’m sorry for mentioning your sadness.

66
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,210
It’s all right. I’m used to it.

67
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,170
Let me introduce San Pao to you.

68
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,760
It was called San Pao...

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,160
because of the sound it produces.

70
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,050
Its attack can only be launched three times.

71
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,370
San Pao. Lead the road.

72
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,690
It’s just a ten-year-old tabby cat.

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,320
San Pao. Don’t disturb it.

74
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,130
This is a ten-year-old solitary bamboo
which features toughness.

75
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,480
Its attack is weak but it’s very defensive.

76
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
It suits your Blue Silver Plant.

77
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Then...

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,650
But, its age is still too short.

79
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,290
Let’s continue to look.

80
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,530
If there is no other choice.

81
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,960
How can I identify its age?

82
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,990
Mainly, you have to observe
the color of them when they attack.

83
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,860
The color of soul beasts is the same
as their soul ring when they attack.

84
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,030
Ten-year soul beasts have white soul power.

85
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,750
A hundred-year one will be yellow.

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,510
So on and so forth.

87
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,650
However,

88
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,050
although 100-year and 900-year
have same soul ring color,

89
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,130
the additional attributes gap is huge.

90
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,720
According to my studies,

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,000
the acceptable limit of the first
soul ring should be 423 years.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,250
Within this area,

93
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,650
I hope that your first soul ring can
get to this limit as close as possible.

94
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,950
This is a required course
for every outstanding soul master.

95
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,730
Yes, Master.

96
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,740
Only that,

97
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,490
you can use power of
the soul ring better in the future.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,090
Do you know why I let you sprinkle the powder?

99
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,160
It’s to mask our odor and get rid of
the snakes, worms, rats and ants.

100
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
That’s right. That’s snake repellent.

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,390
In the Soul Beast Forest, try not to use fire.

102
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,510
Although most of the beasts and
soul beasts are afraid of fire,

103
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,430
there are also some huge
soul beasts that like fire.

104
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,930
If we meet them,

105
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,480
unless your soul power is huge enough,

106
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,390
or you’ll surely die.

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,080
It is Ghost Wolf.

108
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,140
Little San, stay here and don’t move.

109
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,750
How dare a pack of Level 10 wolves
come to disturb!

110
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,710
San Pao!

111
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,070
Farting like thunder. Blasting Luo San Pao!

112
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,480
Wolves and dogs have similar body structures.

113
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,950
They are said to have a bronze head,
steel bone and weak waist.

114
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,210
Their waists are the weak point.

115
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,690
Look. The soul rings are going to appear soon.

116
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,770
Like this.

117
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,310
Draw the soul rings to yourself
using the soul power.

118
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,740
Then, start meditating to absorb
the energy of the soul rings.

119
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,830
My soul power now is unable to be advanced.

120
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,760
So, I can’t absorb it.

121
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,430
The soul rings will fade away in two hours.

122
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,050
Little San, give me two radishes.

123
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,010
San Pao can reduce my soul power
consumption by eating.

124
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,710
It’s because it can only launch three attacks.

125
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,180
So, it has to replenish after every attack.

126
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,160
Does San Pao only eat radish?

127
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,480
You saw it too. San Pao’s attack is farting.

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,670
It’s very rare that any other food
can beat radish in inducing fart.

129
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,840
With two radishes,

130
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,300
after one hour,

131
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,750
San Pao can recover one attack
that has been launched.

132
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,360
<i>This works too?</i>

133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,110
<i>To own a Martial Soul that attacks by farting.</i>

134
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,550
<i>Master is an arrogant person. He...</i>

135
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,950
There’s poison.

136
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,430
Master, it’s there!

137
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,870
It’s Datura Snake.

138
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,520
Why could this kind of soul beast
appear outside of the forest?

139
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,390
Hopefully its age is not too old.

140
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,580
It’ll be difficult if it ages
more than 100 years.

141
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,660
It doesn’t attack...

142
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,750
because it is waiting for the timing.

143
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,890
Master, what are we going to do?

144
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,550
Datura Snake’s venom is very toxic.

145
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,960
It not only has paralytic effect
but also damages the nerve system.

146
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,950
It is one of the most terrifying beings
of the poisonous soul beasts.

147
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,230
Moreover, it’s incredibly fast.

148
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,170
Its body is also extremely tough.

149
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,690
It’s hard to hurt it with an ordinary sword.

150
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,740
Only its mouth and eyes are the weakness.

151
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,360
But, it always protects these two parts very well.

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,360
Stay behind me.

153
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,690
[Soul Land]

154
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,330
I am teaching you a theory now.

155
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,200
When there are more rings,
there are more bones. Attack with power.

156
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,680
When there are fewer rings,
there are fewer bones. Run away.

157
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,330
I’ll explain about soul bone next time.

158
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,040
If your soul rings are more than your opponent’s,

159
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,240
then you can defeat your opponent
with your soul skill and soul power.

160
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,760
If fewer, just run without hesitation.

161
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,010
Farting like thunder. Blasting Luo San Pao!

162
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,710
Run!

163
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,560
Before Datura Snake evolves
up to thousand years,

164
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,940
it will grow 1 centimeter long every year.

165
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,210
This Datura Snake is already 4 meters long.

166
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,180
It’s been nearly 400 years.

167
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,960
<i>This snake is just unharmed.</i>

168
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,990
Farting like smoke. Hypnosis Luo San Pao!

169
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,840
Most beasts like the Datura Snake are impatient.

170
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,470
Let’s hang on there.
It will give up very soon.

171
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,630
San Pao. Stop it!

172
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,620
Come back, San Pao!

173
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,020
Little San, I’ll stop it later.
You find a chance to escape.

174
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,190
Good tactic!

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,030
Little San!

176
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,610
<i>This snake’s defense...</i>

177
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,440
<i>Oh, no! What if Master goes deep...</i>

178
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,750
Little San, how are you?

179
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,930
Master, it’s so scary. Where’s the snake?

180
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,730
Why did you let go of your hands just now?

181
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,790
Do you know how dangerous it is?

182
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,370
<i>Luckily, Master didn’t realize it.</i>

183
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,950
It slipped all of a sudden.

184
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,550
Master. I simply waved the stiletto
you gave me just now.

185
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,360
I think I stabbed the snake.

186
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,920
You may have stabbed on its weakness.

187
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,650
Let’s wait for a while.

188
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,190
Snake-type soul beasts have tenacious vitality.

189
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,980
It won’t die so easily.

190
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,310
<i>That was close.</i>

191
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,590
<i>I have to get more hidden weapons
as soon as possible.</i>

192
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,840
Little San, it’s great.

193
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,100
You finally got your soul ring.

194
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,830
It’s great, Little San.

195
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,430
Master, what did you say?

196
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,250
You aren’t talking about this snake, are you?

197
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,380
Yes. It is.

198
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,710
This snake is nearly 400 years old.

199
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,320
It’s about the limit for a soul master
to absorb the first soul ring.

200
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,110
Due to your inborn soul power,
it’s not a problem to absorb it.

201
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,230
But, Master,

202
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,290
my Martial Soul is a plant. Wouldn’t it conflict?

203
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,140
It isn’t a must to absorb a plant soul
beast’s ring for a plant Martial Soul.

204
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,440
It isn’t necessarily beast Martial Soul
can’t absorbs plant soul ring.

205
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,870
Under certain circumstances,

206
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,400
both of them are mutually absorbable.

207
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,990
A few years back, I’ve mentioned...

208
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,500
one of the ten core competitiveness
martial soul mimicry theories.

209
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,100
I’ve told you before.

210
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,120
One of the great advantages of Blue
Silver Plant is its non-exclusiveness.

211
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,110
As it is too weak,

212
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,990
It doesn’t reject the additional
attributes on any soul ring.

213
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,080
It will only integrate passively.

214
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,440
Do you remember what kind of soul rings
are we looking for?

215
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,930
With additional toughness
and preferably toxic.

216
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,800
That’s right. Datura Snake has
these two characteristics.

217
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,530
Regardless of an ordinary soul master...

218
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,410
or the people from the Martial Soul Hall,

219
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,950
they despise and don’t believe...

220
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,830
my ten core competitiveness theories.

221
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,530
No soul masters absorb different kinds
of soul rings to strengthen himself.

222
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,180
Little San, are you willing to try it?

223
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,840
Although I have absolute certainty
in my theory,

224
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,770
no one has tried it before.

225
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,300
Practice is the sole criterion
for testing the truth.

226
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,530
The ten core competitiveness that I’ve proposed...

227
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,920
is only a theory but not a truth...

228
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,110
because no one is willing to practice it.

229
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,760
Master.

230
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,060
Let me be the one who practices it.

231
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,600
I believe you.

232
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,260
Little San, let us start.

233
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,690
Sit cross-legged. Concentrate on Martial Soul.

234
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,100
<i>Come on, my first soul ring.</i>

235
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,460
<i>You will decide if I can practice
Tang Clan’s peerless talent.</i>

236
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,800
<i>You also decide if I can pass on Master’s hope.</i>

237
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,710
No matter how the power of the soul ring
pounds on your body,

238
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,990
you must stay awake.

239
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,200
<i>So hot. What a strong power.</i>

240
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,910
<i>Is this the inner sight realm?</i>

241
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,600
<i>I did it.</i>

242
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,910
<i>The first bottleneck of Xuan Tian Strike
is finally broken.</i>

243
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,160
Master!

244
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,030
What happened?

245
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,690
Poison!

246
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,630
[Next Episode]
Boss Xiao, are you afraid?

247
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,380
Who do you think I am?

248
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,010
Level 11 one-ring tool soul master.

249
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,900
I can attack anywhere within 50 metres.

250
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,630
A Century Soul Ring?
