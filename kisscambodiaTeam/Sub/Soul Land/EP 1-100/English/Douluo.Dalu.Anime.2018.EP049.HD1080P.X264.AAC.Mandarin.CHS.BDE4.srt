00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,490
that means you’re qualified.

Or else, you will die.

<i>Octa Dark Frost, a unique winter flower.</i>

32
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,110
<i>Even it’s a great item, but it’s poisonous too.</i>

33
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,010
<i>It causes freezing chill and numbness.</i>

34
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,050
<i>Even my Xuan Yu Hand is badly burnt.</i>

35
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,830
<i>This Fiery Soft Apricot is extremely poisonous.</i>

36
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,290
<i>It’s important to understand the nature
and prescription of these herbs.</i>

37
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,310
<i>It tastes good.</i>

38
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,650
<i>I hope they’re not too fiery.</i>

39
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,610
Xiao Gang, we’ve been searching for him for a day.

40
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,570
No matter how well San Pao smells,
if we continue to do it,

41
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,490
it’s struggling for it.

42
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,870
Get some rest.

43
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,710
Don’t worry, Xiao Gang.

44
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,550
Dugu Bo might not kill Tang San.

45
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,230
Or else, he could have done it in our school.

46
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,010
Why took him away?

47
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,590
No, you have no idea.

48
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,410
Dugu Bo abducted Tang San

49
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,390
surely because what he did to Dugu Yan

50
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,210
and the poison casting skill Tang San has shown.

51
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,770
I guess,

52
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,190
Dugu Bo must be eager to know
about Tang San’s poison.

53
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,550
He wants to know what poison Tang San has.

54
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,230
I’m pretty sure

55
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,410
Dugu Bo won’t spare his life.

56
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,270
Those useless Great Soul Land Masters
from Tian Dou Imperial School!

57
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,690
They only know Dugu Bo
stays in this Sunset Forest,

58
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,130
but don’t know in which mountain.

59
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,870
They told us about Sunset Forest,

60
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,230
that means they have already offended Dugu Bo.

61
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,770
Even if they know his exact location,

62
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,910
they can’t tell us.

63
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,090
If anything happens to Tang San,

64
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,150
what are we going to say to him?

65
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,450
Him? Who is it?

66
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,370
<i>In Xuan Tian Records,</i>

<i>in order to enter the Ice Fire Mouth Spring,</i>

68
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,010
<i>one must consume Octa Dark Frost
and Fiery Soft Apricot simultaneously.</i>

69
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,430
<i>Both herbs grow by the two extreme
spring water in Ice Fire Mouth Spring.</i>

70
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,410
<i>Only they can restraint the great force
from both spring water.</i>

71
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,350
<i>If Dugu Bo breaks his promise,</i>

72
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,010
<i>I can even hide in the Ice Fire Mouth Spring.</i>

73
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,290
<i>But, I’m feeling unwell.</i>

74
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,290
<i>Brother, hang on!</i>

75
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,010
<i>You’re heading a new route.</i>

76
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,770
<i>You can’t die, alright?</i>

77
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,850
<i>Little San, remember we’re brothers.</i>

- Little San, Grandpa is here to pick you up.</i>

It’s a Grand Soul Land Master.

<i>If he can cure the poison of
my granddaughter and me,</i>

82

<i>I’d better go and have a look.</i>

85

<i>I’ll get him out if he’s still alive.</i>

86

<i>How dare someone challenge me?</i>

87
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,810
<i>Alright, I would like to see who is that.</i>

<i>Two Saints of Soul above Level 70.</i>

89

<i>and a soul master under Level 30.</i>

<i>Do they have death wishes?</i>

You’re here for me?

92
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,010
Dugu Bo, where’s Tang San?
Where did you hide him?

Senior Dugu, Tang San is our disciple.

We’re not sure how he offended you,

97
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,490
but since you’re a Grand Soul Land Master,

98
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,210
we beg you to let him go.

99
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,010
That kid, I’ve already killed him.

Even though three of you are weak,

102

117

<i>It looks like the Golden Dragon.</i>

<i>Even the Golden Dragon isn’t as powerful as me,</i>

<i>They aren’t dodging?</i>

<i>It’s soul bone. This isn’t Dugu Bo’s soul-ring skill.</i>

130
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,550
<i>It’s an additional ability by soul bone,
and it is about the head.</i>

<i>Farting like thunder. Blasting Luo San Pao.</i>

What skill is this?

133
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,270
It can turn my power into stones?

134
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,470
<i>This is the Medusa Gaze.</i>

135
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,650
<i>Then his soul bone should be the top
among snake-type soul beasts.</i>

136
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,610
<i>His soul bone is only produced
by the queen of snake, Medusa.</i>

137
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,890
<i>It must be fallen from one of the
Decade Millennium Medusa.</i>

Wait. Dugu Bo, Tang San is my disciple.

This has nothing to do with them.

Good, that’s great.

Even if I can’t defeat the dragon from your tribe,

170

but when I kill all of you,

171

if I can’t even handle the poison,

175
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,610
I don’t deserve to be in the clan.

176
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,530
If I drink his blood, maybe...

177
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,410
Time’s up.

178
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,330
If you fail my test, I’ll still kill you.

179
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:29,230
Just right, I can kill them all and save my trip.

180
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,790
How dare you, Dugu Bo?

181
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,550
Tang San.
