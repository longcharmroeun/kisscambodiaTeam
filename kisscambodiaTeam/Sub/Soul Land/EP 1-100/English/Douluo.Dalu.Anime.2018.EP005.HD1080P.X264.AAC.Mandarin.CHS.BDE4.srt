Alright, enough.

Please accept me as your disciple.

30
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,130
You’ve become a Master’s disciple?

31
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,110
Who are you? Why are you attacking me?

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,700
I’m Wang Sheng, the boss of this dorm.

33
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,660
You’ve defeated me,

34
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,320

the boss of this Dorm Seven.

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,210
Boss.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 5]

37
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,310
Me? I’m here to study, not to be your boss.

38
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,430
This is the rule. Whoever wins the battle leads.

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,730
Right, this is the rule.

40
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,930
By the way, did you use soul skill just now?

41
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,640
Is this Dorm Seven?

42
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,420
Mixed-gender housing is allowed here?

43
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,890
We’re still kids.

44
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,540
Our school’s dorms are gender-neutral.

45
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,630
We’ll only be divided by gender during
Intermediate Soul Master School.

46
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,380
This is weird.

47
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,880
Last year we didn’t have an apprentice.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,320
Yet this year we have two.

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,950
Boss, go on! Show her some colors.

50
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,240
Me?

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,870
There’s a newbie, we must test her abilities. Go!

52
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,080
I don’t think it’s necessary.

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,140
Hello, I’m Xiao Wu, the “Wu” from dance.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,230
Hi, I’m Tang San.

55
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,470
I’m the chief of this dorm.

56
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,280
You can call me by my name.

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,140
May I ask about your Martial Soul?

58
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,710
My Martial Soul is a rabbit,
a very cute little white rabbit.

59
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,680
What about you?

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,300
Yours restrain mine perfectly.

61
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,110
My Martial Soul is your
Martial Soul’s food, Blue Silver Plant.

62
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,760
That’s interesting, can I come in?

63
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,620
Here is the thing.

64
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,750
Dorm Seven has a rule.

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,270
The new apprentice must
show their Martial Soul’s ability.

66
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,280
So, I want to have a friendly fight with you.

67
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,280
Are you sure?

68
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,550
Yes.

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,170
Okay.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,540
Come on.

71
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,920
Are you okay?

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,160
Come on, boss!

73
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,200
<i>Gosh.</i>

74
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,520
<i>I think I might be the
shortest-lived boss of Dorm Seven.</i>

75
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,760
Tang San, are you alright?

76
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,910
I have lost.

77
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,290
Can you tell me,

78
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,040
what skill you used just now?

79
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,160
I used Rou skill.

80
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,790
It’s a skill which utilizes the softness
and flexibility of our body.

81
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,620
<i>Rou skill.</i>

82
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,030
<i>Of all the famous clans in
the martial world including Tang Clan,</i>

83
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,950
<i>I’ve never seen any martial art like this.</i>

84
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,970
<i>This skill is powerful, yet it is full of risk.</i>

85
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,810
<i>Just now she caught me off guard.</i>

86
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,680
<i>If I had a quicker response,</i>

87
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,880
<i>At that close distance, it’s easy to attack her.</i>

88
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,120
<i>Why are the apprentices
for this year so skillful?</i>

89
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,990
According to the dorm’s rules, you win.

90
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,590
From now on you’ll be
the dorm leader, which is our boss.

91
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,070
That’s right.

92
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,940
Boss, sounds interesting.

93
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,230
Okay, then I’ll be your boss from now on.

94
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,160
<i>It’s not bad being an apprentice after all.</i>

95
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,870
Good, dismiss.

96
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,030
Boss, have a seat.

97
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,830
Tang San, what level is your soul power?

98
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,800
When we fought just now,
I feel that you’re quite strong.

99
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,130
I’m born with full soul power,

100
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,650
that’s why I’m more powerful.

101
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,820
Born with full soul power?

102
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,390
<i>No wonder he’s more powerful than me.</i>

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,100
Who is Tang San?

104
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,100
I am.

105
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,570
I’m Teacher Mo. This bedding is from Grandmaster.

106
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,740
Thank you, Teacher Mo.

107
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,190
Tang San and Xiao Wu is year one apprentice.

108
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,190
You’ll be in charge of the south side
of the garden beside the field.

109
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,290
You’ll get ten copper soul coins daily.
If you slack, you’ll be expelled.

110
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,460
Okay.

111
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,670
Tomorrow is the school opening ceremony.

112
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,480
You’ll start working after the classes
start on the day after tomorrow.

113
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,870
I’ll check on you randomly.

114
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,200
If you have questions, ask Wang Sheng.

115
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,880
Okay.

116
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,610
Boss, you can use my bedding.

117
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,830
Boss, use mine.

118
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,560
Boss, use mine instead.

119
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,450
Don’t call me boss, just call me Sister Wu.

120
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,840
Alright, Boss. Oh, it’s Sister Wu.

121
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,830
Little San, let’s discuss this matter.

122
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,840
Little San?

123
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,440
Your bedding is huge,
it’s enough to cover two people.

124
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,420
What about this?

125
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,250
Let’s move our beds together and
share the bedding together, okay?

126
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,860
Together? Is it appropriate?
It is improper for us to get too close.

127
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,090
I’m a girl, if I don’t mind. Why should you mind?

128
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,450
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

129
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,950
Move the bed near you.

130
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,070
I thought you are strong?

131
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,160
Put your bag here too.

132
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,110
From now on, this will be the border.

133
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,630
If you pass the border, I’ll not be easy on you.

134
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,990
[Soul Land]

135
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,250
Wow!

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,550
How huge!

137
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,070
This canteen can fit three hundred
students and teachers to eat at once.

138
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,160
Of course, it is enormous.

139
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,830
Let’s go in, I’m starving.

140
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,760
Well, aren’t these Wang Sheng and his poor gang?

141
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,790
If you’re poor, you’re forever poor.

142
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,110
It will be impossible for them
to go to the second floor to eat.

143
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,940
Who are you?
What’s so great about the second floor?

144
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,970
Wow, such a pretty little girl.

145
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,820
Too bad you’re just an apprentice.

146
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,680
The second floor is a place where you can
order and have your meals personally.

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,490
The price is high, we can’t afford it.

148
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,300
Wang Sheng, I’m going to eat now.
I’ll let you go for this time.

149
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,670
Darn it.

150
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,230
<i>When did he...</i>

151
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,490
Never mind, we’re here to eat.

152
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,730
You’re afraid of trouble.

153
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,140
<i>Rules of Tang Clan.</i>

154
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,380
<i>All Tang Clan’s disciple are
not allowed to look for trouble.</i>

155
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,060
Never mind, let’s eat first.
We’ll teach them a lesson soon.

156
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,060
<i>But if someone attacks first,
we’re allowed to fight back with all might.</i>

157
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,170
Master, you’re here to eat too.

158
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,390
Have you done tidying all your things?

159
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,580
Thank you for the bedding.

160
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,350
Follow me to the second floor to eat.
I’ll show you around.

161
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,160
Wang Sheng, isn’t this meal on you?

162
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,880
I’m going to eat this.

163
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,400
No, thank you. I’ll eat with my dorm mates.

164
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,500
Good. You’re not acting like a maverick.

165
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,720
Wait for me at the
canteen’s entrance after your meal.

166
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,550
Do you know the Grandmaster?

167
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,640
He is my Master.

168
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,940
Oh no, you’ve acknowledged
Grandmaster as your Master?

169
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,490
His ability is just average.

170
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,280
It is rumored that
he’s in good terms with the Dean,

171
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,480
so he stays here as a guest teacher.

172
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,220
In other words, he’s a freeloader.

173
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,870
I heard that Grandmaster’s almost fifty,
yet he’s stuck in the Great Soul Master level.

174
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,530
There are only twenty-nine
levels in Martial Soul.

175
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,390
He probably can’t go higher than this anymore.

176
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,910
This is the first time, and I hope it’s the last too.

177
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,370
If you don’t want to fight me again,

178
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,740
don’t bluntly comment on my Master.

179
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,140
Thank you for your kind intentions.

180
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,680
I think, there’s no need
for you to pay for my meal.

181
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,560
<i>Dad, can you give me this piece of steel?</i>

182
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,120
<i>Dad, it’s mealtime.</i>

183
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,750
<i>Dad, I’ve done it for ten thousand times.</i>

184
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,590
<i>Dad, practice makes perfect.</i>

185
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,880
<i>Dad, I’m leaving.</i>

186
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,240
Eat first, you’re growing up.
You must eat well.

187
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,370
Master...

188
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,180
Hurry up and eat. Eat it while it’s still hot.

189
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,070
After the meal I have something to tell you.

190
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,180
Don’t waste your time.

191
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,720
Come, show me your the other Martial Soul.

192
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,560
Tang San surname is Tang...

193
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,500
Okay, withdraw it back.

194
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,750
Don’t simply show it in front of others.

195
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,060
Without my permission,

196
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,270
don’t add a soul ring on this Martial Soul either.

197
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,580
My father said this too.

198
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,820
<i>I want you to promise me,</i>

199
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,160
<i>no matter how you practice your soul power,</i>

200
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,680
<i>never add any soul ring to that hammer.</i>

201
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,380
<i>Moreover, never show it in front of others.</i>

202
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,280
<i>And never tell anyone that...</i>

203
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,400
<i>you have Twin Martial Soul.</i>

204
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,120
<i>Can you do this?</i>

205
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,100
What’s your father’s job?

206
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,480
The blacksmith in the village.

207
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,320
Blacksmith?

208
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,920
Blacksmith and hammer are quite a pair.

209
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,780
Why can’t I add a soul ring to this Martial Soul?

210
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,600
Now it’s not the time to tell you yet.

211
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,510
You just need to keep this in mind.
It’s all for your future, remember.

212
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,040
<i>Dad said this. Master said the same thing.</i>

213
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,390
I will.

214
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,480
Good, if that so,

215
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,960
tomorrow morning, I’ll bring you
to look for a suitable soul ring.

216
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,070
For you to level up to a soul master.

217
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,070
<i>With the soul ring,</i>

218
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,230
<i>I can make progress in Xuan Tian Strike, but...</i>

219
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,030
Tomorrow is the school opening ceremony.

220
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,840
I’ll settle the school for you.

221
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,720
Come, tell me your views about Blue Silver Plant.

222
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,700
Everyone thinks that
it’s a useless Martial Soul.

223
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,300
But I think that
everything has its own specialty.

224
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,470
Even if it’s a commonly found Blue Silver Plant.

225
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,310
It surely has its reason to exist and ability.

226
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,540
Good. It’s rare for you to have such insights.

227
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,100
Let me tell you about the
development path of the Martial Soul.

228
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,510
The development path of the Martial Soul?

229
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,470
Let’s start from
the categories for Martial Souls.

230
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,220
We divide Martial Soul into two categories.

231
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,880
Which are beast soul and tool soul.

232
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,310
Beast soul is a merge of human and Martial Soul.

233
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,640
It utilities the beast’s power on our own...

234
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,030
to reach the state
in which the soul and body are one.

235
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,090
We call that Martial Soul Shield Body.

236
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,690
Whereas tool soul is different.

237
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,600
Most tool souls need to leave the body to be in use.

238
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,450
Tool souls are more like
an auxiliary compared with beast souls.

239
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,030
Furthermore, some Martial Souls
can be seen as food.

240
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,700
Can we eat Martial Souls too?

241
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,420
Of course.

242
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,600
All Martial Souls in the Food Branch are edible.

243
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,820
You can think of
the soul power as a type of energy.

244
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,340
Living things eat to obtain energy.

245
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,280
That means, tool souls are for support,

246
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,920
right?

247
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,540
This is not exactly correct.

248
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,130
There’s similarity and difference among
tool soul master and war soul master.

249
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,280
Some tool martial soul can be war soul master.

250
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,570
Every soul master has his path.

251
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,490
For instance, Food Branch, Investigation Branch,

252
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,040
Combat Branch, Healing Branch,
Controlling Branch and so on.

253
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,250
Once we set our path for Martial Soul,

254
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,580
when we’re obtaining soul rings,

255
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,400
there will not be a clash
between the ring and the soul.

256
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,030
Master, which path should I go to?

257
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,520
Many think that the Blue Silver Plant is useless.

258
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
But after years of research,

259
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,470
Blue Silver Plant has its strength too.

260
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,100
First, it consumes little soul power.

261
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,650
Second, it’s found everywhere and deceitful.

262
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,160
Third, it has various paths to develop.

263
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,740
It doesn’t repel the soul ring easily.

264
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,240
Repel?

265
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
That’s right.

266
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,780
If your Martial Soul
doesn’t match with the soul ring,

267
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,620
adding the soul ring on the Martial Soul...

268
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,320
will result in a repulsion.

269
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,080
And the fourth benefit only works on you.

270
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,300
Me?

271
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,490
[Next Episode]
What are you doing?

272
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,910
Didn’t I come?

273
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,170
Convinced or not?

274
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,680
I’ve found a way to fight with you.

275
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,500
Hit your right shoulder.

276
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,440
We’re preparing to enter the forest.

277
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,670
From now on,

278
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,250
don’t ever leave my side, not even a single step.
