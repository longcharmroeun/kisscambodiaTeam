From now on, you should start training.

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,200
Keep on absorbing to strengthen your power.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,720
Don’t eager for quick results.

23
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,840
Understood.

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,280
Be careful!

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,460
Xiao Gang, I lost.

26
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,720
Seems like if they join forces,
they can defeat Zhao Wu Ji.

27
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,360
Little Freak, my wish has come true.

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,940
It’s time to leave.

29
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,900
Old Freak, take care of yourself.
Don’t forget about the two iron balls.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 55]

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,460
What’s the matter?

32
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,700
Brat, are you new?

33
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,180
Don’t you know the rules of the advanced class?

34
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,520
Rules?

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,380
Don’t you know that

36
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,560
no one is allowed to sit next to Xiao Wu?

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Who allows you to sit here?

38
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,160
Me.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,580
Nothing else to do now? Get away.

40
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,060
Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude.

41
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,940
Xiao Wu, it’s our guy’s matter.
Don’t get involved.

42
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,320
I give in to you,
it doesn’t mean I’m afraid of you.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,060
Do you think me as the school chief
could just back down?

44
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,340
School chief?

45
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,800
Who’s this hick?

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,320
Doesn’t even know our school chief.

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,740
He’s the most...

48
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,960
The most outstanding student in the school.

49
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,840
<i>I see.</i>

50
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,839
<i>Is he even stronger than Boss Dai?</i>

51
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,979
<i>I must be more alert.</i>

52
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,140
Brat, you have two choices now.

53
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,500
First, fight with me, one-on-one.
If you win,

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,940
I’ll admit that you’re qualified to sit here.

55
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,760
Second, get off now.
Find another place to sit.

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,740
One-on-one? Right now?

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Do I have to pick a place
to duel with you little kid?

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,780
Don’t worry, I don’t bully kids.

59
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,020
I’m not using my third soul skill.

60
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:57,680
One may escape an untoward act of God,
but never the evil of their own.

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,380
Then come on.

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,700
Tang San, Martial Soul of Blue Silver Plant.

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,020
War soul honor of Controlling Branch at Level 37.

64
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,660
What? You’re at Level 37?

65
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,560
Is he afraid?

66
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,000
Tai Long, Martial Soul of
Supreme Orangutan.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,640
War soul honor of Storm Attack Branch at Level 37.

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,300
He’s doomed.

69
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,440
If his level is higher,
he’d have more bouts to fight.

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,240
Come on, boss.

71
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,940
Humph, such a fragile Blue Silver Plant.

72
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,340
Quiet! Class is going to begin.

73
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,900
Little San, are you bullying your classmate
on your first day?

74
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,060
I’m sorry, Teacher Shao.
I’ll release him now.

75
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,380
Teacher, it’s me who wanted
to challenge Tang San.

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,860
Tang San, I disclaim it.
Let’s duel again.

77
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,220
Can you stop it?

78
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,700
A strength-type soul master challenging
a soul master of Controlling Branch.

79
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,140
Are you out of your mind?

80
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,920
But I...

81
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,580
Let’s fight physically,

82
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,280
instead of fighting with our martial soul.

83
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,420
Sure.

84
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,980
Enough, here is not the soul arena.

85
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,800
It’s time for class now.

86
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,940
Find a place to settle your problem after class.

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,340
I’ll wait for you after class.

88
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,280
Brother, Tai Long keeps pestering me.

89
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,240
Sort him out properly later.

90
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
He pesters you?

91
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,480
He’s always approaching me.

92
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,580
Hump! I don’t care about him.

93
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,380
<i>Why do I feel annoyed about</i>

94
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,260
<i>Xiao Wu gaining attention from others?</i>

95
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,660
Finally, class is over.

96
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,680
It’s finally over.

97
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,180
Brother, there’s a lot of good food in Tian Dou City.

98
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,260
Let’s go stroll.

99
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,740
Great, let’s go.

100
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,180
Let’s ask Fatty and Little Ao too.

101
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,940
Why do you bother bringing them along?

102
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,580
They’re so boisterous.

103
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,040
Forget about them, just two of us go.

104
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
Xiao Wu, even if you’re afraid of us
bothering your date,

105
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,100
it’s not necessary to mock me.

106
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,020
I’m so handsome, charming, and talented.

107
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,420
How could I be boisterous?

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,460
Tang San, follow me.

109
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,820
He’s still not finished!

110
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,460
Brother San, do you want me to deal with him?

111
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,640
No, you go first.

112
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:14,160
[Soul Land]

113
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,100
Haven’t we arrived after walking so far?

114
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,180
Right here then.

115
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,240
Let’s start.

116
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,260
Are you convinced now?

117
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,780
No!

118
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I’ll beat you till you concede.

119
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,080
Tai Long is tenacious though.

120
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,720
He didn’t want to stop
even you’ve thrown him away many times.

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,660
If I didn’t dislocate his joints,

122
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,800
the fight won’t be ended.

123
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
It’s good though.

124
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,060
He shouldn’t dare to pester you.

125
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,620
Let’s go eating.

126
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,320
Brother, look. What’s that?
What a strange giant hemisphere.

127
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,340
It seems to be an auction house.

128
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,540
The symbol above should be the gavel
dedicated to the auction house.

129
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,620
An auction house?
Can we go take a look?

130
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,480
I remember Grandmaster said that

131
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,740
only the capitals of
two imperial empires possess

132
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,760
auction houses with the highest standard.

133
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,320
They even sell soul bones.

134
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Let’s go eating first though.

135
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,080
But, it seems like every restaurant is full.

136
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,920
It’s all because of Tai Long

137
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,660
who wasted our time.

138
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,500
Brother, there’s fast food.

139
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,400
Let’s eat it before we go to the auction house.

140
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,720
Boss, what do you have?

141
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,420
Little girl, my meal is delicious yet cheap.

142
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,260
2 copper soul coins for 1 set.
Do you want?

143
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,380
Give me two then.

144
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,280
By the way, give all the meat to him.

145
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,660
How could it be? You should eat more.

146
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,080
Never mind.

147
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,880
You’re growing now.

148
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,740
Grandmaster said that boys should eat more meat.

149
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,020
Or else you won’t have strength.

150
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,880
Xiao Wu, no matter what happens in the future,

151
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,760
I will be by your side as I am now.

152
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,340
You’re always my precious Xiao Wu.

153
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,060
I know you care for me very much.
Let’s eat quickly.

154
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,240
<i>There’s some soul power left here.</i>

155
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,100
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

156
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,700
How pitiful.

157
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,660
Brother.

158
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,460
What kind of treasure is it

159
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,060
that those didn’t hesitate
to kill the guards of the auction house.

160
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,000
Could it be a soul bone?

161
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,700
Stop there. Loiterers keep away.

162
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,240
This is the auction house. We want to go for a look.

163
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,000
I’m sorry, my guests.

164
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,240
Do you have
the bidding qualification certificate?

165
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,660
Bidding qualification certificate?

166
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,440
You don’t even know that.

167
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,580
Do you want to break in?

168
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,760
Only guests with
a bidding qualification certificate

169
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,180
are allowed to enter the auction house to bid.

170
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,560
The threshold of having the certificate
is 10,000 gold soul coins.

171
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,980
As it can avoid malicious bids.

172
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,240
I hope you understand.

173
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,760
Is there any other way to get in?

174
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,340
You may enter if you’re here to sell something.

175
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,820
But the items must be appraised by
our appraisers at Tian Dou Auction.

176
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,860
And the value must exceed 1000 gold soul coins.

177
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
We’ll sell this then.

178
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,680
What’s this?

179
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,500
A weapon.

180
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,720
This way, please.

181
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,980
Appraiser, these two guests would like
to put this item up for auction.

182
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,840
What an intricate creation.

183
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,900
May I ask what it is?

184
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,180
Could you please show me?

185
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,200
I named it Malicious Attack, and it’s poisonous.

186
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
It’s poisonous?

187
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,540
This weapon is potent,

188
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,040
is there any suitable place for a demonstration?

189
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,500
Please.

190
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,560
[Next Episode]
The coming lot

191
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,540
is a nonpareil among all.

192
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,460
This lot is starting at

193
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,380
100,000 gold soul coins.

194
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,840
It’s in my interest.

195
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,480
Sold.

196
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,860
I come to see

197
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,680
who dares to beat my son.

198
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,520
It’s meaningless to save those
who’ve lost their soul.

199
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,880
How could I not save one with soul?

200
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,940
Are you going to save them all?

201
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,160
The two of you, who’s Tang San?

202
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,460
I am.
