<i>Come on then.</i>

23
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,130
I admit that I lost.

Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent is yours now.

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,550

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,700
I have also reached Level 30 just now.

Little San.

33
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,180

[Episode 24]

35
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,240
<i>This is...</i>

36
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,260
<i>King of Forest, Titan Giant Ape.</i>

37
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,490
<i>Titan Giant Ape is like the overlord
of the soul beasts.</i>

38
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>It has the same wisdom as human.</i>

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,630
<i>Its strength, speed, attack and defense...</i>

40
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,830
<i>are almost flawless.</i>

41
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,800
<i>Even if it’s only at a century level,</i>

42
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,380
<i>it can also battle with soul beasts
at decade millennium years old.</i>

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,100
<i>The most terrifying is...</i>

44
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,460
<i>they can also use similar skills
like our soul skills.</i>

45
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,200
<i>This is the soul beast
standing at the top of the pyramid.</i>

46
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,660
<i>It is also a nightmare for all soul masters.</i>

47
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>This Titan Giant Ape looks so strong.</i>

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,490
<i>Its cultivation is obviously
over ten thousand years.</i>

49
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,790
<i>Probably, no soul beast can compare...</i>

50
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,270
<i>with this terrifying king.</i>

51
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,240
<i>It should have existed
in the core of the Star Dou Forest.</i>

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
<i>Why does it appear here?</i>

53
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,080
Dear King of the Forest.

54
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,660
We don’t mean to offend.

55
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,660

<i>Titan Giant Ape understand human language.</i>

57
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,580
<i>Hope it is not malicious.</i>

58
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,540
<i>Is it like Little San said...</i>

59
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,780
<i>the indiscriminate killing...</i>

60
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,580
<i>has created soul beasts’ hatred towards human?</i>

61
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,880
<i>What shall we do?</i>

62
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,160

<i>By increasing 30% of its strength and speed,</i>

73
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,860
<i>So does Teacher Zhao at Level 76.</i>

74
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,120
<i>That means Teacher Zhao’s current attack...</i>

<i>the real body of Supreme Bear Martial Soul?</i>

92

<i>This soul skill is overbearing.</i>

93
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,460
<i>Its side effect is also the strongest.</i>

94
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
<i>It can use any soul skills</i>

95
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,980
<i>under Level 7</i>

<i>while the defense is increased by 200%.</i>

99

<i>the soul master’s own attributes</i>

<i>They’ll need 7 days to recover.</i>

103
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,660
<i>So, unless there’s no choice,</i>

104
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,180
<i>a soul master who exceeds Level 70...</i>

105
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,220
<i>would no use it.</i>

106
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,540

Blame me if you want.

157
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,980
You’ve also seen Little San’s look.

158
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
If I didn’t help him,

159
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,500
I’m afraid he’s going to walk.

160
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,660

161
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,140

Don’t go anymore.

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,740
I need to go back as soon as possible.

171
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,140
Er Ming, you shouldn’t have come out to look for me.

172
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,220
Brother is injured.

173
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,140
I was caught by you.

174
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,380
He must be very anxious.

175
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,020
Er Ming, you shouldn’t have done it.

176
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,540
If you see me next time, you should observe first.

177
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,660
You cannot hurt my friends anymore.

178
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,320
Is Da Ming all right?

179
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,970
That’s good.

180
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,060
Since I was brought out by you,

181
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,620
I’ll simply complete the third soul ring.

182
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,370
Er Ming, you cover it for me.

183
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,300
<i>Xiao Wu,</i>

184
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,740
<i>where are you?</i>

185
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,020
<i>You must stay alive.</i>

186
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>I’ve promised to protect you.</i>

187
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,420
<i>You must stay alive.</i>

188
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,780
<i>Xiao Wu.</i>

189
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,820
[Next Episode]

190
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,260
It’s Human Faced Demon Spider.

191
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,620
No!

192
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,140
Who did this?

193
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,820
You rest at Tang Clan.

194
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,740
Everything will be all right.

195
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,100
Seems like there is something important...

196
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,530
that I need to do.
