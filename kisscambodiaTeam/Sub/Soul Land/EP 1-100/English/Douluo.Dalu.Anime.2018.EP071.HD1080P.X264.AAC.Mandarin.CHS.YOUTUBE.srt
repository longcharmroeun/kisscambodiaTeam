[This animation is based on the novel Soul Land]
[written by Tangjia Sanshao]

23
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,010
[Previous Episode] I heard that you knew
the reason why my father

24
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,520
went into seclusion.

25
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,880
Martial Soul Hall.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,000
If that isn’t a dream, Martial Soul Hall...

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,960
I’ll never let go those who killed my parents.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,980
It’s all because of our greedy dean,
he could do anything for money.

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,040
Qibao Amber Tribe should have a skill
named Heart Separation Control, right?

30
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,120
I want to return a favour too.

31
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,450
[Soul Land]
[Episode 71]

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,020
Theoretically,

33
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,240
what His Royal Highness has said is correct.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,240
The point lies in what exactly the secret item is.

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,340
Why did Martial Soul Hall turn all out for it?

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,020
Yet they returned with nothing,

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,760
and even might lose their pope.

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,920
Could it be a soul bone?

39
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,000
The most precious thing for every soul master

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,200
must be the soul ring and soul bone.

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,400
Soul ring is exclusively specified,
it can’t be taken.

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,140
But a soul bone can.

43
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,320
No, if it’s the soul bone,
Martial Soul Hall wouldn’t lose.

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
Even though your father is powerful,

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,860
it’s impossible to fight alone
against Martial Soul Hall.

46
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,340
In fact, apart from the pope
of Martial Soul Hall,

47
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,100
there’re at least
three Grand Soul Land Masters.

48
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,320
I think if they didn’t insist
on getting the secret item,

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
it’s either damaged

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,020
or has lost its function.

51
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,920
Lost its function? Could it be a soul beast?

52
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,780
But how could a soul beast
be related to your father?

53
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,730
Putting aside how high the level of
a soul beast drew their attention,

54
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,970
it’s impossible a soul beast
would be with your father,

55
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,660
due to the unresolved conflict
between human and soul beasts.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,460
Your father wouldn’t have offended
Martial Soul Hall for a soul beast either.

57
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,040
Your analysis makes sense.

58
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,160
Father,

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
I’d have known the truth,
if only I could meet you again?

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,680
Brother San, I knew my father will
certainly agree.

61
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,800
Little San, Heart Separation Control
isn’t a secret skill.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,340
If it’s useful, you could learn it
together with Rong Rong.

63
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,140
How could such a modest skill compare with

64
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,320
your contribution to Qibao Amber Tribe?

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,180
Ning Feng Zhi.

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,380
I think no one dares to mock us any more.

67
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,220
From now on, those humiliations will vanish.

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,820
I suggest you concede defeat in the next competition.

69
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,340
Ah?

70
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,600
I’ve been observing your opponents these days.

71
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,460
Your opponents...

72
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,000
Now, you have three choices.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,720
First, give up this battle
and preserve your strength.

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,200
Second, go with the previous formation.

75
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,820
But you have less than 1% of chance to win.

76
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,680
Third, compete with
the best key members of your team.

77
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,400
However, your strength might be revealed

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,420
if your team win.

79
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,060
Master, who exactly are our opponents?

80
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,300
Why are you so anxious?

81
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,720
Your opponents are
from Elephant Armoured Tribe.

82
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,700
What? That strongest defensive tribe?

83
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,940
Shrek School.

84
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,120
Only through your fiasco

85
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,020
could glorify Martial Soul Hall.

86
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,020
It’s the Elephant Armoured Tribe
who ranked the sixth

87
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,200
among the seven great tribes.

88
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,760
No, I’m afraid it could be higher than the sixth,

89
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,440
if there’s one
Grand Soul Land Master from this tribe.

90
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,700
It’s said that Chief Huyan Zhen
isn’t merely the Great Soul Land Master,

91
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,740
his defence is stronger than
others from his level.

92
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,670
The hereditary martial soul of
Elephant Armoured Tribe

93
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,140
is Diamond Mammoth.

94
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,740
It’s a super soul with supreme defence.

95
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,380
Mainly on strength and defence.

96
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,720
Your opponents are
the direct disciples of this tribe.

97
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Three of the seven are at Level 40,

98
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,180
While the rest are almost reaching it.

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,660
I suggest you all give up this competition

100
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,520
for the ultimate victory.

101
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
After all,

102
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,440
top five qualifiers can enter the finals.

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
It’s nothing wrong

104
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,880
to conceal your strength in the early period.

105
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,080
But if they give up, my advertising fee...

106
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,400
Brother, stop being greedy!

107
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,540
If these little devils got injured
in this competition,

108
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,160
it’ll be hard to handle in future competitions.

109
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
Are you aware of it?

110
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,540
You guys make the decision then.

111
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
We’ll fight!

112
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,960
Master, we know what you’re saying.

113
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,820
However, we’re competing not only for victory,

114
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,840
but also to train ourselves.

115
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,980
If we keep out those strong rivals,
we can’t progress.

116
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,220
And it’s not worth being
the monster students of Shrek School.

117
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,900
I reckon, we must think of new tactics
and agility in duelling with them.

118
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:43,230
[Soul Land]

119
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,660
Why did Huyan Zhen come here too?

120
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,020
You’ll know when you see
Elephant Armoured School’s opponents.

121
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,500
Salas invited Huyan Zhen here

122
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
maybe because of them.

123
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,700
That’s the chief of Elephant Armoured Tribe,

124
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,520
Huyan Zhen, the Heavenly Elephant.

125
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,900
Could it be Martial Soul Hall?

126
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,160
It should be.

127
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,580
Among the seven great tribes,

128
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,940
Qibao Amber Tribe from Upper Three
always supports Tian Dou Empire.

129
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,520
Hao Tian Tribe secretly supports
Xing Luo Empire.

130
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,760
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe
stays neutral.

131
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,550
Meanwhile, Lower Four are closed

132
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,180
to Martial Soul Hall.

133
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,300
Even they aren’t its subordinates,
they’re on the same boat.

134
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,340
The reason why Martial Soul Hall
is regarded as the strongest among all

135
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,740
and even can compete
with the two empires

136
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,880
is due to the support of Lower Four.

137
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,660
How interesting this
Soul Master Elite Tournament is.

138
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,450
Feng Zhi, you’ve predicted Shrek Seven Devils

139
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,140
will be the great soul masters.

140
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,460
Today, they’re going to duel
with Elephant Armoured Tribe.

141
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,020
Do you still think so?

142
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,340
Why not?

143
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,540
Elephant Armoured Tribe’s flaw
is as obvious as their strength.

144
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,680
With Tang San’s wisdom

145
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,200
and superb guidance from Master,

146
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,720
they’re in no doubt to win

147
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,900
if they fight all out.

148
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,660
Wait, they’re...

149
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,160
Let’s welcome Shrek School Team and
Elephant Armoured School Team.

150
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,440
Captain Dai Mu Bai and
Vice Captain Tang San from Shrek School.

151
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,500
These two soul sects participated
in the first preliminary round.

152
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,120
Their results are excellent.

153
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,620
These three soul honors are familiar faces too.

154
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,120
But they seem to be lower ranked
than Elephant Armoured School.

155
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,760
I wonder how they will make up for each other.

156
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,640
Here comes the new member, Zhu Zhu Qing...

157
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,360
She’s a soul sect too.

158
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,100
From Keen Attack Branch, at Level 41.

159
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,300
Two yellow and two purple soul rings.

160
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,060
Shrek School has four soul sects.
[Tool soul sect from Food Branch]

161
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,880
This is beyond our expectation.

162
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,560
In the last round,
three members from Shrek Seven Devils.

163
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,820
We now sent out five members for this round.

164
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,400
Zhu Qing replaces Tai Long.

165
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,460
Little Ao replaces Jiang Zhu.

166
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,700
It won’t reveal our full strength,

167
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,400
and yet we’ll have the chance to win.

168
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Good. Very targeting strategy.

169
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,780
Little San, why didn’t you send me to duel?

170
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,280
Our opponents are defence and
strength type of soul masters.

171
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,700
At least, I can help to block them head-on.

172
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,600
I’m confident in my ability to resist attack.

173
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,860
He didn’t intend to fight head on,

174
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,460
that’s why he lets Zhu Qing
takes over your position.

175
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,260
Little San, you’ve done the strategy, right?

176
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,900
They didn’t perform their full strength,

177
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,860
when facing such strong opponents
like Elephant Armoured Tribe.

178
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,180
Are they too naive to be fearless

179
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,760
or are they too confident?

180
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,120
Let’s take a look at
Elephant Armoured School Team’s data.

181
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,820
Captain of Elephant Armoured
School Team, Huyan Li.

182
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,400
War soul sect from Defence Branch,
at Level 43.

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,900
Two yellow and two purple soul rings.

184
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,140
He’s young and talented.

185
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,540
Let’s look forward to his performance.

186
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,240
The following are two soul sects, at Level 41.

187
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,640
Two yellow and two purple
soul rings as well.

188
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,780
There are three soul sects
in this team of seven members.

189
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,720
It’s really worthy of Elephant Armoured School.

190
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,460
Four soul honours almost reaching Level 40.

191
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,940
This is a robust team.

192
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,760
Their opponents should watch out.

193
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,720
Seven soul masters of defence type
build up a strong fortress.

194
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,300
Will they keep their opponents at bay today?

195
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,540
It seems like the battle between them
aren’t coincidental.

196
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,780
He suppresses Shrek
since he failed to recruit them.

197
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,660
I just found something interesting.

199
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,420
Shrek School Team has changed the uniform.

200
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,100
But who knows whether their luck

201
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,980
will disappear with their previous uniform.

202
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,140
This game must be exciting.

203
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,120

211

Diamond Mammoth.

215
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,260
Preliminary second round, first match.

216
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,550
Shrek School versus Elephant Armoured School,

217
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,380
officially begins!

218

219
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:46,900
[Next Episode]

220
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,720
Brother, should we use that skill?

221
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,980
Set up the fort.

222
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,760
Retreat.

223
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,400
Bring Tang San out!

224
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,220
Trigonal Defence, please.

225
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,240
