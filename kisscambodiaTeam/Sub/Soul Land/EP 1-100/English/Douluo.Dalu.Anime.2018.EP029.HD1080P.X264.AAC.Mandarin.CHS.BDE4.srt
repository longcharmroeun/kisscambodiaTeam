Xiao Wu, you’re still alive?

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,020
Brother!

22
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,230
Is Little San becoming a big spider?

23
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,870
An outer is always an outer.
You can only be trash.

24
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,270
How dare an outer disciple
peep at the inner practice!

25
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,760
Give him a lesson!

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,060
If you still have improper thoughts,

27
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,310
I will definitely report to
Grandmaster Tang Lan

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,120
to expel you from the clan.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 29]

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,010
Brother, I’m back.
You must hang in there.

31
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,880
You said that you’d protect me forever.

32
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,360
You must not break your promise.

33
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,780
<i>An outer disciple is willing to
never enter the inner.</i>

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,140
<i>But I have to study
the secret scripture of Tang Clan.</i>

35
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,710
Hey, it’s time to change shift.

36
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,250
Okay.

37
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,140
<i>In any case, I mustn’t hurt
my schoolmates with hidden weapons.</i>

38
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,870
<i>I mustn’t reveal myself either.</i>

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,560
<i>It’s said that there are 3 levels
in Scriptures Library.</i>

40
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,440
<i>On Level 1, guards are enforcing martial law.</i>

41
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,130
<i>Level 2 is guarded by 3 Elders
with the most powerful hidden weapons,</i>

42
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,460
<i>to ensure no fish slips through the net.</i>

43
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,870
<i>Level 3 is the place
that the secret scripture is kept.</i>

44
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,580
Let’s check over there.

45
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,950
<i>This shall be the entrance to Level 3.</i>

46
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,560
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,990
<i>Looking thoroughly, in details.</i>

48
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,790
<i>Three Elders have a full-round sight.</i>

49
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,620
<i>This is impervious.</i>

50
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,630
<i>Once any object appears,</i>

51
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,660
<i>I’m afraid it can’t escape
the capture of these red lines.</i>

52
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,680
<i>Three Elders would never miss a single sound.</i>

53
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,310
<i>If I want to break through,
death is the only option.</i>

54
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,290
<i>I got it.</i>

55
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
<i>It’s Xuan Tian Records.</i>

56
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,780
<i>It’s Xuan Tian Records that record
the strongest skill of Tang Clan.</i>

57
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,370
Who is it?

58
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,960
Grandmaster Tang Lan.

59
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,170
Outsiders know that Tang’s Scriptures
Library has 2 levels highly guarded.

60
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,630
But they don’t know about the core of Level 3.

61
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,290
I have guarded it on my own for years.

62
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,510
Tang San is unfilial.
I’m willing to be punished.

63
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,720
What if you’re to be expelled from Tang Clan?

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,190
I was adopted by Tang Clan when I was a baby.

65
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,790
Since then, I have been part of Tang Clan

66
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,700
for eternal life and will never change until death.

67
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,490
Grandmaster.

68
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,710
Tang San, do you know why I saved you?

69
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,810
Grandmaster, you’re kind.

70
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,050
Wrong! I saved you because of Tang Clan.

71
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,240
In the past, Tang Clan reached its zenith.

72
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,190
No one was a match for us.

73
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,600
However, with the fame growing,

74
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,940
the inner has become hierarchical and
more red tape were created.

75
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,960
The outer disciples couldn’t practice
the highest skills.

76
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,490
The inner disciples are not qualified enough.

77
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,110
The pedantic rules have made
many secret scriptures lose.

78
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,090
In this way, Tang Clan couldn’t
escape its fate of falling.

79
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,390
Only the survival of the fittest, being eclectic,

80
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,420
is the core for the prosperous of Tang Clan.

81
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,790
I haven’t seen you today.

82
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,650
You have never been to Scriptures Library.

83
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,460
Tang San.

84
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,890
How will Tang Clan develop in the future?

85
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,230
You might as well try it boldly.

86
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,670
<i>Revive Tang Clan.</i>

87
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,220
<i>Little San, I am leaving.</i>

88
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,550
<i>You will count on yourself in the future.</i>

89
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,450
Grandmaster.

90
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,770
<i>Heinous treason! Don’t let him go!</i>

91
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,140
<i>In the future,</i>

92
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,110
<i>you must use the hammer in your left hand</i>

93
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,880
<i>to protect the plant in your right hand forever.</i>

94
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,550
<i>Brother, you must put effort.</i>

95
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,960
- Soul power transformation succeeded!
- That’s great!

[Soul Land]

97
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,530
Xiao Wu.

98
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,710
Brother.

99
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,790
Xiao Wu, it’s you?

100
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,370
Brother, it’s me.

101
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,310
I am not dreaming, right?

102
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,730
It’s not a dream. I’m back, Brother.

103
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,210
It’s all my fault. I made you worry.

104
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,310
It’s my fault.

105
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,190
It’s my bad for not being able to protect you.

106
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,840
No. It’s not your fault.

107
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,450
Have you got hurt?

108
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,620
Little San.

109
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,610
Who took off my clothes?

110
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,570
You guess.

111
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
What is the situation?

112
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,630
No idea.

113
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,590
Has your soul ring mutated?

114
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,100
A soul ring never mutates.

115
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,260
Only Martial Soul does.

116
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,490
I absorbed the soul ring of Human Faced
Demon Spider and got a skill.

117
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,320
Everything is so normal.

118
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,040
But, there’s no explanation for
the 8 spider legs on my back.

119
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,240
Can you control the 8 spider legs on your back

120
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,660
and keep them?

121
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,240
You can’t leave it like this all the time.

122
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,120
You’ll be treated as a monster.

123
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
We are monsters.

124
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
You, little rascal.

125
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,590
Let me try it.

126
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,060
Tang San! Brother San.

127
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,710
Did you kill Human Faced Demon Spider with that?

128
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,670
Oh, yes. I will show it to you guys too.

129
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,590
Wait. I can feel something.

130
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,170
Something is approaching.

131
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,070
It’s Human Faced Demon Spider.

132
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,750
The size is much smaller than this one.

133
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,570
They’re its descendants.

134
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,800
It’s a big amount.

135
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,830
It’s bad. My strength hasn’t recovered.

136
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,580
My strength is also limited. I’ve miscalculated.

137
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,050
What shall we do now?

138
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,030
There’s a way.

139
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,030
I used the hidden weapon to kill
the Human Faced Demon Spider.

140
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,130
These young Human Faced Demon Spiders
are not powerful.

141
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,850
If we use the hidden weapon well,

142
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,860
we may survive the crisis.

143
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,260
Xiao Wu, this is for you.

144
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,800
Brother, you use it.
I can protect myself.

145
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,070
Do you remember what I told you?

146
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,010
<i>But I can give you my promise.</i>

147
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,180
<i>I’ll protect my younger sister forever.</i>

148
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,960
Little monsters, let’s start the battle!

149
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,760
Yes!

150
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,570
Why is this so difficult?

151
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,250
It’s because you’re too lousy.

152
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
Rong Rong, I’m coming!

153
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Rong Rong, are you all right?

154
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,210
I don’t need your rescue.

155
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,110
You’re the ones who put my brother in danger!

156
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,210
Dangerous! Don’t you hurt Xiao Wu!

157
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,790
Are you all right, Xiao Wu?

158
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,410
This hidden weapon is quite useful.

159
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,790
Exactly. We could beat so many of them
without using Martial Soul.

160
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,820
Brother San, can you sell this to me?

161
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,270
Sell it to you?

162
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,210
I am a soul master of Assisting Branch
with self-protection ability.

163
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,120
If...

164
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,950
Forget about selling. I’ll give it to you later.

165
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,450
Isn’t this inappropriate?

166
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,550
It’s all right. If you feel embarrassed,

167
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,650
you can pay for the materials.

168
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,190
Little San, are we good brothers?

169
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,380
I got it. I’ll give you a set too.

170
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,460
I’ll give one to every each of you.

171
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,490
All of them have money.

172
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,880
It’s hard to make this crossbow.
Just collect the money you deserve.

173
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,170
Teacher Zhao is right.

174
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,680
Little San, we can’t make you suffer losses.

175
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,600
Okay, we shouldn’t stay long
at this place. Hurry up and leave.

176
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,750
Let’s talk about it along the way.
