Dean, please help me.

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,930
I want the Burrow Demon Spider.

25
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,370
You want to escape? No way!

26
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,560
Dean, it’s here!

27
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,050
This soul beast is something!

28
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,020
If I let you escape again,
I won’t be the Four-Eyed Eagle Owl!

[Soul Land]
[Episode 66]

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,290
You should never let her down.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,000
If not, no matter who’s your master,

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,520
you will suffer the same fate
as that King of the Land last time.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,090
I, Tang San, swear to God,

37
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,540
I will never let Xiao Wu down.

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,610
Little San, the Burrow Demon Spider
is holding on to its last breath.

39
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,600
You should go and absorb its soul ring.

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Dean, you’re right.

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,210
I feel much better.

42
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,080
Later, I will absorb its soul ring
in the Ice Fire Mouth Spring.

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,270
It’ll speed up the process.

44
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,680
Before I’m done with it,

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,270
you all should not go near
the Ice Fire Mouth Spring,

46
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,590
in case you guys will get hurt.

47
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,470
Xiao Wu, no matter if his decisions
are right or wrong,

48
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,960
you need to support him.

49
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,810
You should be happy for him
if he made the right decision.

50
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,550
Mother, you’re right.

51
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,770
I should always support him.

52
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,080
Xiao Gang, come with me.
I need to speak to you.

53
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,820
<i>Xiao Gang.</i>

54
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,120
<i>Luckily, I have a daughter now.</i>

55
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,160
<i>I do understand why you took
Tang San as your disciple now.</i>

56
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,640
<i>At least we can place our emotion on them.</i>

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,250
<i>Even if we can’t lead a happy life together,</i>

58
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,250
<i>I hope they can be happy.</i>

59
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,430
<i>Brother San.</i>

60
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,410
<i>My son!</i>

61
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,180
Xiao Gang, do you wanna continue
this state with Er Long?

62
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,700
I don’t know.

63
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,560
You don’t know?

64
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,430
Er Long has waited for you for 20 years.

65
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,860
She spent a long time waiting for you!

66
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,790
Although you’re my brother,
I want to beat you up right now!

67
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,430
Actually, I want to beat myself up too.

68
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,250
It’s all my fault.

69
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,230
But Er Long is suffering because of me.

70
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,030
Xiao Gang, are there no other ways?

71
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,750
If this continues, both of you
will suffer until the end.

72
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,440
You should know that

73
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,400
Er Long only like you

74
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,190
and no one else.

75
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,590
I shouldn’t stay by her side,

76
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,540
and make her suffer again.

77
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,160
Xiao Gang, do you love Er Long?

78
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Of course.

79
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,960
That’s good. I’m sure that

80
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,530
Er Long has always loved you too.

81
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,890
Since that’s the case,

82
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,850
both of you are together already.

83
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,080
Can I say that?

84
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,590
You!

85
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Since both of you love each other,

86
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,920
Why can’t both of you

87
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,400
be united in the mental state?

88
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,690
You don’t need any recognition.
You just need her approval.

89
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,120
Both of you can be together mentally.

90
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,220
Frander, I don’t understand.

91
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,740
It’s easy.

92
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,540
You guys can be a couple.

93
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,680
Just don’t change the way
you address each other.

94
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,860
If you two love each other mentally,

95
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,840
nobody can talk about it.

96
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,060
Is that really okay?

97
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,080
Why not?

98
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,820
At least, both of you will feel better.

99
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,550
You two love each other.
There’s nothing wrong with that.

100
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,050
Frander, why didn’t you say that earlier?

Why isn’t he back yet?

104
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,400
He’ll return to us. He’ll surely return to us.

that hard for you?</i>

<i>God, why are you punishing me like this?</i>

108
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,000
I’ve let you down.

109
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,170
Let’s be together.

110
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,770
Xiao Gang, do you know how long
I’ve waited for you?

111
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,250
How many days and nights?

112
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,680
Do you know how I got through every day?

113
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,560
You’re not escaping anymore?

114
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,390
Are you willing to be with me now?

115
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,880
Er Long, I swear,

116
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,700
I won’t ever try to escape from you again.

117
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,460
Although we can’t be a normal couple,

118
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,090
I will still love you forever.

119
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,360
Okay. Everything is fine
as long as you return to me.

120
