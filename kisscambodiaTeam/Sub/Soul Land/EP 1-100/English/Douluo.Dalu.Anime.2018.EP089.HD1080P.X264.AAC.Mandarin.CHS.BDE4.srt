[Previous Episode]

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,800
Fourth soul skill, God Locking Ring.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,820
You have to pay for what you’ve done.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,730
Dragon in Heaven. Jade Lightning.

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,760
Tang San.

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,680
Let us decide who the champion
of the qualifying rounds is.

29
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,660
[Soul Land]
[Episode 89]

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,860
<i>So fast.</i>

31
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,180
<i>Xuan Yu Hand.</i>

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,460
Feng Xiao Tian is from Storm Attack Branch.

33
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,760
Why is he as fast as Keen Attack Branch?

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,260
Actually, he can be considered as
Keen Attack Branch too.

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,980
<i>Gale Double-headed Wolf. I see.</i>

36
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,560
Second soul skill,
Double Wolves Shield Body.

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,620
Such Mutated Martial Soul
like Gale Double-headed Wolf

38
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,820
has a keen attack characteristic

39
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,620
on top of the storm attack foundation.

40
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,760
I believe Little San has realized that too.

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Brother San will surely find a way
to defeat him.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,620
Up to now, without using
his third and fourth soul skills,

43
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,820
he has led his team to continuous
victories. Don’t look down on him.

44
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,680
It’s indeed a battle between
two teams of complete victory.

45
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,860
Tang San pretended to be weak
to lure Feng Xiao Tian to his trap.

46
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
He’s so thoughtful at such a young age.

47
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
It’s indeed rare and commendable.

48
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,940
First soul skill, Aero Sword Formation.

49
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,860
Turns out Feng Xiao Tian is risking himself,

50
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,800
in order to release Aero Sword Formation.

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Just for the first soul skill?

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,660
Feng Xiao Tian’s first soul skill has
a boundary limit. It isn’t precise.

53
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,800
Despite so,

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Feng Xiao Tian chose to continue releasing it.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,680
It must be very powerful.

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Especially with the help
of Double Wolves Shield Body,

57
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
the power of Aero Sword Formation
has greatly improved.

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,300
It won’t be easy for Little San to react.

59
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,680
Second soul skill, Parasite.

60
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,260
First soul skill, Aero Sword Formation.

61
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,040
First soul skill, Intertwine.

62
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,420
Although Little San was tricked by
Feng Xiao Tian just now,

63
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,420
a direct attack is just to feign.

64
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,820
Planting Blue Silver Plant
is his real aim.

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,340
Right. Then enclose him with Blue Silver Plant
to have a series of attack.

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,700
Little San is doing really well in this battle.

67
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,060
Wow, he won. Little San is so powerful.

68
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,460
This battle is far from done.

69
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,620
How is that possible?

70
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,600
Up until now,

71
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,300
Feng Xiao Tian has only used
his first and second soul skills.

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,720
That means he hasn’t done his best.

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,740
Third soul skill, Gale Wings.

74
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,060
Besides forming wings of wind,
my third soul skill

75
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,120
can also bring my body condition to the top.

76
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,040
So, you’ve been planning this since the beginning?

77
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,780
Tang San, you’re stronger than I imagined.

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,620
Despite so, I’ll defeat you.

79
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,700
The strength of Feng Xiao Tian
is much more powerful than mine.

80
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,400
This time, Little San...

81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,180
The tougher it is,
the better it can help him grow.

82
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,640
This battle has brought us too much.

83
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,120
Your Majesty,
the battle is only just about to start.

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
Oh?

85
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,720
I’ll defeat you with my self-created soul skill.

86
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,100
You’ll have a moral victory.

87
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,720
Gale Devil Wolf with 36 continuous chops.

88
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Self-created soul skill
isn’t like given soul skills,

89
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,020
which can form naturally.

90
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,640
It’s formed through continuous
trials and training.

91
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
It’s more practical
than common soul skills.

92
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,560
It’s more powerful.

93
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,760
His talent is frightening.

94
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,500
<i>The strength is way stronger than last time.</i>

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
That’s not good.

96
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,300
What happened, Dean?

97
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,020
Look. Feng Xiao Tian’s 36 chops
work through leveraging.

98
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,280
Speed and strength
are superimposed continuously.

99
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,760
Superimposed continuously?

100
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,980
This is only the fourth time,

101
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,320
yet Little San is already injured.

102
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,820
If there are 36 times...

103
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,680
<i>Brother, you must be careful.</i>

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,340
<i>I can’t await death without doing anything.</i>

105
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,360
Fourth soul skill.

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,000
It’s Blue Silver Cage again. You’re out of ideas.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Blue Silver Spike Formation.

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,140
Is this a self-created soul skill too?

109
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,540
<i>This is the mutated version
of his fourth soul skill.</i>

110
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,380
<i>The activation speed of Blue Silver Cage
is much faster.</i>

111
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,480
<i>This can be considered as
Little San’s last trick. However...</i>

112
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,340
<i>I can’t run away anymore. I have to...</i>

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,980
Fourth soul skill, Storm of Devil Wolf.

114
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,240
<i>It has been broken through.</i>

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
<i>The attack coverage is everywhere.
I can’t escape by Ghostly Trace.</i>

116
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,760
<i>Xuan Yu Hand is at its extreme.</i>

117
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,720
<i>I’ve already...</i>

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,700
<i>Could I really be defeated this time?</i>

119
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,680
Brother.

120
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,700
<i>No.</i>

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,880
Weapon?

122
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,580
Could this be...

123
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,760
- That is...
- Hao Tian Hammer? How is it possible?

124
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,820
Yes, Your Majesty. He is the son
of Grand Hao Tian Master.

125
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,300
Grand Hao Tian Master?

126
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,140
Could this be Hao Tian Hammer?

127
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,260
You still recognize Hao Tian Hammer.

128
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,960
Do you know what you’ve missed then?

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,920
Hao Tian Hammer.

130
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,860
Little San wants to fight directly.

131
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,040
Hao Tian Hammer is the number one
tool soul in the world.

132
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,220
Even without an additional soul ring,
it weighs 500 Jin.

133
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,900
But when facing the self-created
soul skill of Feng Xiao Tian, I’m afraid...

134
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,260
Random Air Hammer Skill.

135
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,280
Little San is...

136
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,120
The only thing they can compete now

137
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,500
is the persistence.

138
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
I believe in him.

139
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,480
<i>For Sister Huo Wu,
I have to win.</i>

140
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:34,440
[Soul Land]

141
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,680
You’re the first person who persists
until the 36th strike.

142
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,040
How can they...

143
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,300
Twin Martial Souls, right?

144
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,200
The hammer is called Hao Tian.

145
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,500
Hao Tian Hammer?
It seems I can’t complain about my defeat.

146
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,100
Actually, you didn’t lose.

147
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,280
It’s just that your self-created
soul skill was limited by me.

148
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,340
Besides, there’s nothing
between Huo Wu and me.

149
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,700
If you like her, that’s your business.

150
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,960
Please don’t involve me.

151
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,720
Awesome.

152
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,940
Random Air Hammer Skill is done so adeptly.

153
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,120
They’re indeed the team
that Chief Ning thinks highly of.

154
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
They can make the empire proud.

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,660
My daughter

156
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,900
will only be seen fighting
in the final round.

157
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,480
<i>Well, good one, Hao Tian Tribe and Tang Hao.</i>

158
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,560
<i>I’ll show you who’s the master of Soul Land.</i>

159
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,720
Let’s go.

160
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,540
After a few days of competition,

161
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,720
15 teams of Tian Dou Empire
have performed distinctively.

162
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,880
Special congratulations to Shrek School.

163
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,160
They have obtained complete victory
by winning all 14 battles.

164
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,620
- Great. Awesome.
- Not bad.

165
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,840
In this year’s competition,

166
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,960
the Crown Prince, Xue Qing He,
will be the envoy of the empire,

167
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,460
in joining the jury.

168
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,540
Moreover, Royal Cavalry Troop of
500 strong will be assigned as an escort.

169
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,540
I hope all of you can make
the empire proud.

170
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,980
Aren’t you ready? We’re departing soon.

171
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,940
Xiao Gang isn’t found yet?

172
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,620
Xiao Gang said in his letter that
he’s going to look for her.

173
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,200
<i>You have to help me then.</i>

174
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,640
<i>For the sake of Little San, I have to see her.</i>

175
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,440
Xiao Gang has no choice.

176
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,940
You knew about it?
Why did you let him go?

177
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,820
He...

178
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,020
Dean Frander, Deputy Dean Liu Er Long.

179
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,800
Royal Cavalry Troop of Tian Dou is pressing.

180
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,940
He said he must see her for
something urgent. Don’t you trust him?

181
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,300
It’s not that I don’t trust him.
I just don’t understand.

182
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,980
It’s been so many years.

183
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,500
Why would he still need to see her?

184
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,980
Er Long, have faith in yourself and Xiao Gang.

185
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,240
Okay. Let’s go

186
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,580
to Martial Soul City for the final round.

187
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,700
Hooray.

188
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,480
Alright, just stop here.

189
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,380
Class will start soon.

190
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Don’t hold up the curriculum of the kids.

191
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,840
Don’t worry, Dean.

192
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,900
Handle the kids in the school to us.

193
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,420
It won’t be held up.

194
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,140
We, the teachers who can’t join the final round,

195
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,220
wish the Little Devils
good results in this trip.

196
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,940
No problem.

197
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,800
Yes. No problem.

198
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,420
Just count this on Fatty alone.

199
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,280
That’s not what I mean.
I just wanted to ease the atmosphere.

200
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,040
Holy Lady, the Pope means...

201
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,160
Fellow Elders.

202
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,620
Our teacher doesn’t wish
to see this person in Martial Soul City.

203
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
Don’t worry, Teacher.

204
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,340
The honour of this competition
belongs to Martial Soul Hall.

205
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,260
[Next Episode]
Little San, what are you thinking about?

206
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,960
Regarding us...

207
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,700
Get into the cart.

208
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,140
Shh. Keep quiet.

209
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,620
Something is happening.

210
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,540
Right now,

211
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,100
the most important thing
is to protect the children.

212
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,940
It is indeed so.

213
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,080
There are so many of them.
They’re obviously prepared.

214
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
Qin Ming.
