00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,240
Now, he’s two times stronger than he was before.

22
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,440
You used poison.

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,680
The power differences of 21 levels...

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,340
are indeed hard on my body.

25
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,320
What’s your current soul level?

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120

[Soul Land]
[Episode 58]

29
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,260
Malicious Attack? Soundless Arrow?

30
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,600
Dad, why did you have
Brother San’s hidden weapons?

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,760
Your Brother San made them?

32
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Let me show you how to use hidden weapons.

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
Let’s go outside.

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,220
Rong Rong, how do you plan to show it to us?

35
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,840
Grandpa Sword, why don’t you have a try?

36
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,000
You’re so powerful. I’m sure
you wouldn’t be hurt by them.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,760
I think your Grandpa Bone is stronger.

38
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,440
He should do it.

39
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,360
You coward. I’ll do it.

40
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,880
Do you really think I meant that?
Stay away.

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,100
Both of them are Grand Soul Land Masters.

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,920
They are at Level 95 and 96 respectively.

43
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
But they still act like kids
when they throw their tantrums.

44
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,500
Let me do it for you, little princess.

45
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,200
Little lass, use whatever you have.

46
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,840
I’ll block them off.

47
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,060
If so, Grandpa Sword, you have to be careful.

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,180
This is the Soundless Arrow.

49
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,940
That is a feint attack!

50
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,880
Sword Aura!

51
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,780
Godly Zhuge Crossbow!

52
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,460
Aura Sword!

53
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,960
<i>That’s powerful.</i>

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,100
Malicious Attack!

55
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,740
Here’s the poisonous weapon.

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,740
Sword Aura!

57
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,160
Uncle Sword, you’re so strong!

58
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,020
The hidden weapons are powerful indeed.

59
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,500
Especially the crossbow.

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,040
It has a strong impact.

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,880
Soul masters under Level 40...

62
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,620
can’t block it if they’re not cautious.

63
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,140
Of course!

64
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,940
We defeated a team of soul masters at Level 40
in the soul arena with it.

65
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,100
Shoe Crossbow, Hidden Knife!

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,460
You haven’t done yet?

67
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,780
That’s fast!

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,040
One with the sword!

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,300
Grandpa Sword, you’re so strong!

70
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,780
You’re strong too.

71
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,120
You forced me to use my Martial Soul.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,460
This hidden weapon is really something.

73
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,720
Yeah. Brother San said

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,960
hidden weapons should be used
when the opponents are unaware.

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,240
So it can be used to its fullest potential.

76
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,880
Back-tightening Crossbow!

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,820
Grandpa Sword, you...

78
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,740
Rong Rong, on your knees!

79
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,980
Feng Zhi, what are you doing?

80
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,360
It’s the old fellow’s fault. He’s too weak.

81
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,040
How can you blame Rong Rong for this?

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,880
Grandpa Sword, I’m wrong.
Please punish me.

83
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,940
Rong Rong, be a good girl. Don’t cry.
How is this your fault?

84
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,120
We agreed to test hidden weapons out.

85
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,320
You didn’t do wrong.

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,460
And I’m fine now.

87
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,120
Tribe Chief, the hidden weapons
are strong indeed.

88
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,760
If possible, we must ask the maker
to join our tribe.

89
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,580
Rong Rong, regarding this,
don’t tell anyone in our tribe yet.

90
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,940
Tomorrow, I’ll go to Shrek School with you

91
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,120
to meet this Brother San of yours.

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,860
Dad, are you not angry at me anymore?

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,120
Why would I be angry at you?

94
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,640
Just now, I was too anxious.

95
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,900
<i>The pain inside my body
has disappeared completely.</i>

96
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,080
<i>In the Ice Fire Mouth Spring,</i>

97
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,580
<i>the Octa Dark Frost and Fiery Soft
Apricot did increase my endurance.</i>

98
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,220
<i>[Brother, Oscar is back. I’ll go back first.]</i>

99
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,080
<i>[Eat this sausage when you wake up.]</i>

100
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,200
<i>[I’ll visit you tomorrow morning.]</i>

101
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,720
<i>[From Xiao Wu.]</i>

102
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
<i>My Purple Demon Eye is stronger now.</i>

103
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,960
<i>I’ve reached the Surreal level now.</i>

104
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,400
<i>Not only my Purple Demon Eye has improved,</i>

105
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,660
<i>my Xuan Tian Strike has improved too.</i>

106
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,920
<i>If I follow this progress,</i>

107
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,840
<i>I can attain the
highest level in Xuan Tian Strike.</i>

108
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,160
Brother!

109
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,660
The class is so difficult.
I can’t understand them at all.

110
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Look.

111
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,140
It’s Tang San.

112
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,340
What’s going on?

113
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
Good job, Tang San!

114
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,380
You defeated a Soul King.

115
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,940
Of course, everyone would notice you.

116
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,240
Look at those girls’ loving eyes.

117
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,300
I’m so jealous.

118
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,820
Uncle Sausage, you’ve revealed yourself. Playboy.

119
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,340
Don’t speak nonsense. I only love Rong Rong.

120
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,980
Two words for you.

121
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,180
Be sincere.

122
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,880
Be sincere?

123
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,620
You can only feel the sincerity from others...

124
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,420
if you treat them sincerely.

125
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,340
Little Ao, you may not notice...

126
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,900
the way Rong Rong looks at you is different.

127
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,240
If you’re sincere enough,
you will earn your rewards.

128
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,000
Tang San, go and have a look!

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,680
It’s Tai Long! They’re back!

130
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,240
They still want to fight?

131
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Did his father come again?

132
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,000
Not just his father,

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,420
even his grandfather is here!

134
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,760
- What?
- What?

135
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,600
At this time?

136
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,860
The Dean and the others
all went to hunt soul beasts for Boss Dai.

137
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,120
Xiao Wu, go and find Teacher Zhao.

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,980
Little Ao, let’s go and have a look.

139
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,160
Super Recovery Big Sausage!

140
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,460
Just in case.

141
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,500
Yeah.

142
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,180
Look.

143
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:31,080
[Soul Land]

144
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,760
Grandpa, I beg you. Please go back.

145
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,900
If you create a mess again, I’ll be expelled.

146
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Shut up.

147
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,860
Who’s Tang San?

148
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,280
I am Tang San.

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,200
I’m Tai Tan, the head of Li Tribe.

150
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,940
Did you injure my son and my grandson yesterday?

151
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,380
I did.

152
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,760
Okay.

153
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,080
You managed to injure them,

154
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,320
because they’re weak,

155
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,760
but it doesn’t mean that my tribe is useless.

156
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,820
I won’t bully you.

157
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,040
Let’s make a bet.

158
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,980
What’s the bet?

159
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,700
<i>The pillar is made from reinforced steel.</i>

160
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,500
<i>That incense can pierce through the pillar
form long distance</i>

161
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,440
<i>and without any damage.</i>

162
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,960
<i>This old man is scary.</i>

163
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,440
I won’t use any skills or use my Martial Soul.

164
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,780
You win if you can withstand my soul
pressure until the incense burns out.

165
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,600
And I’ll ask them to kowtow
and apologize to you.

166
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,520
If not, you’ll have to join my tribe.

167
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,760
This is unfair!

168
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,140
If you lose,

169
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,360
they just need to kowtow and apologize to him.

170
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Although it’s a disgrace,

171
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,680
they won’t lose anything.

172
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,840
<i>I should delay this as long as I can.</i>

173
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,520
If Little San loses,

174
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,960
he has to join your tribe and will be restricted.

175
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,260
What kind of bet is this?

176
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,900
What do you propose then?

177
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,640
It’s easy. If you lose,

178
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,220
they have to join Tang San’s tribe.

179
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,680
Oh, you have a tribe too?

180
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,980
Yes. I’m from Tang Clan.

181
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,520
Tang Clan? I didn’t hear of that before.

182
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,480
Maybe it’s a small tribe.

183
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,440
Okay, deal. If I lose,

184
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,800
both my son and my grandson
will join the Tang Clan.

185
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,280
Little San, that’s all I can do for you.

186
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,340
Senior, please.

187
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,040
I heard Tai Long’s grandfather is here.

188
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,400
Come, let’s have a look.

189
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,880
You can do it!

190
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,500
<i>So strong!</i>

191
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,900
<i>He is at a different level from Zhi Lin.</i>

192
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,220
<i>If Zhi Lin’s soul pressure were like river waves,</i>

193
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,460
<i>This old man’s soul pressure is like a flood.</i>

194
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,640
<i>Is he a Great Soul Land Master?</i>

195
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,380
<i>This kid, he actually withstood my first wave.</i>

196
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,780
<i>Is he really at Level 37? If that’s so...</i>

197
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,700
Teacher Zhao, please stop them!

198
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,620
The battle began.

199
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,700
We’ll have to wait until the battle ends.

200
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,400
Why is Little San fighting with him?

201
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,360
You know him? He’s Tai Long’s grandfather.

202
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,400
Of course, I do.

203
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,520
In the past, I hit his disciples accidentally.

204
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,720
And he hunted me down.

205
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,340
That’s why I joined Frander to set up Shrek School.

206
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,720
He’s stronger than you?

207
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah. That old man is over Level 80.

208
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,160
I can face the other Great Soul Land Master.

209
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,080
But he’s all about strength.

210
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,420
Regarding his strength,

211
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,220
he’s stronger than most
Grand Soul Land Masters.

212
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,200
Eight Spider Bone!

213
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,819
Is that a soul bone?
It’s an attached soul bone!

214
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,699
This kid is indeed awesome. Since it came to this...

215
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,780
<i>You mustn’t let people know that
you are born with two Martial souls.</i>

216
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,620
<i>Am I losing? Will I lose here?</i>

217
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,900
[Next Episode]

218
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,840
Do you admit your defeat?

219
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,100
Remember to keep calm...

220
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,620
no matter what they are going to say.

221
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,880
who exactly is my father?

222
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,560
What exactly happened?

223
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,880
Please tell me!

224
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,420
What happened to you?

225
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,560
You must be wary of Ning Feng Zhi.

226
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,060
Ning Feng Zhi is ambitious.

227
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,700
Kid, you’re a good businessman.

228
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,060
Are you willing to sell us the method
of making hidden weapons?
