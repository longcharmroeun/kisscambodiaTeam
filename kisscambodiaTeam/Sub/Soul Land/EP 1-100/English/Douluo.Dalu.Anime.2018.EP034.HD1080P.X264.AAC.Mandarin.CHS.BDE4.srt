I was hit by a wretched man.
It was embarrassing.

44
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,180
Fatty, were you fighting someone for a woman?

45
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,790
That’s why you were hit, right?

46
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,790
What are you saying?

47
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,670
I was just helping someone

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,720
Fatty, what happened to you?

49
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,240
Boss Dai, you have to help me find justice.

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,310

We’re finally on holiday.

55
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,660
So I contacted the beauty that I met a few days ago.

56
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,280
And then a rogue interrupted.

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,060
Registration fee is 10 gold soul coins.

It isn’t safe to be here alone at night.

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,430
Let me send you home.

64
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,240
Stupid.

65
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,930
Why are you so annoying?

66
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,110
Do you think you can escape?

67
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,000
What a beauty.
It seems I won’t be lonely tonight.

68
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,970

69
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,680
Don’t get in my way.

70
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,110
Run.

71
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,520
You rogue.

72
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,200
How dare you harass my woman?

73
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,260

The Merging of Phoenix.

75
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,360
So you fought with him?

76
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,100
Of course. Neither beauty and delicacy
can be let down.

77
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,590
But who knew that fellow
was a Soul Sect with four soul rings.

78
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,610
So I became like this.

79
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,240
The worst thing is

80
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,610
he crossed over my body in front of everyone.

81
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,930
Boss Dai, Second Brother, Brother San.

82
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,990
You have to do me justice.

83
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,440
What is his name?

84
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,650
Bu Le or something.

85
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,620
Then I found out,

86
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,200
that fellow is a notorious ruffian here.

87
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,190
He’s involved in illegal business

88
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,570
and loves to harass young and beautiful girls.

89
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,540
Normal folks are no match to soul masters.

90
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,690
Bu Le, a Soul Sect.
Just because he’s capable,

91
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,340
he’s doing some villain business.

92
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,500
He’s a black sheep of all soul masters.

93
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,410
That’s right. He even hit Fatty.

94
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,110
As a soul master, he’s bullying the weak.
That’s humiliating.

95
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,800
It seems

96
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,550
this is the time for Shrek School
to do something.

97
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,280
Yes, we have to help Fatty find justice.

98
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,490
Soul masters are unlike common folks.

99
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,920
If we start fighting out of revenge

100
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,770
and act violently, which is an abuse of our talent.

101
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,130
But if it’s to punish the evil,

102
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,200
and defend peace,

103
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,320
it shouldn’t be refused.

104
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,950
That’s right.

106
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,040
Hurry up. We may stop him if we go now.

107
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,930
Where are you creeping to?

108
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,650
Fatty, why is your face swollen?

109
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,610
Who’s so cruel to hit you to hits point?

110
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,700
Boss Dai, could it be you?

111
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,370
Would I be so cruel to my brother?

112
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,900
Fatty wanted to be a hero to save a beauty,

113
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,640
but he lost.

114
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,250
We’re going to punish the evil now.

115
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,580
That’s cool. Count me in.

116
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,490
That person is a pervert.

117
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,330
Besides, he has a higher soul power than us.

118
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,450
It’s too dangerous for a girl.

119
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,450
What? That’s a better reason
for me to come along.

120
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,850
I have to do justice for girls.

121
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,110
Alright then. This is dangerous.

122
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,300
But we’ll face it together.

123
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,840
That fellow has higher soul power than us.

124
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,340
Tell us his condition in details.

125
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,360
He’s quite tall.

126
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,940
His face is so black, it’s as if
he just crawled out from a stove.

127
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,490
His Martial Soul is odd.

128
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,670
It feels like it has a similar function
to Brother San’s Martial Soul.

129
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,670
A soul master of Controlling Branch.

130
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,550
I think so.

131
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,120
His Martial Soul looks like two claws.

132
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,270
They are pitch black.

133
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,150
When they’re summoned, they would fly to his back,

134
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,990
like a pair of little wings.

135
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,730
That’s so disgusting.

136
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,520
Two pitch-black claws, flying to his back?

137
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,040
What kind of weird Martial Soul is that?

138
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,480
When he fought me, he used two soul skills.

139
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,510
First, he enlarged the claws,

140
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,920
to block my Phoenix Firing Line.

141
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,670
The second one was to produce some black smoke.

142
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,460
The black sticky liquid in the smoke
limited my body movement.

143
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,530
He then hid in the smoke.

144
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,870
I couldn’t attack him.

145
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,810
So I was entangled by the slime,

146
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,850
wrapped like a dumpling.

147
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,730
And then he hit me like his sandbag.

148
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,780
Soul Sect should have four soul skills.

149
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,180
That means, two are still unknown.

150
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,330
Brother San, the three of you are Soul Honors,

151
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,520
in addition to me, a soul master at Level 27,

152
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,170
would we still be afraid of him?

153
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,160
I have my mushroom sausage.
If we can’t defeat him, we’ll just flee.

154
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,550
If I’m right,

155
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,560
his Martial Soul is born to restrain flame.

156
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,940
So your Evil Flame wouldn’t work on him at all.

157
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,920
Since there are two unknown soul skills,

158
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,810
we can’t plan a strategy, which increases the risk.

159
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,480
Here it is?

160
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,600
That’s right. It’s said that Bu Le
is active around here at night.

161
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
This place is remote.

162
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,440
The residents won’t be disturbed.
It’s good to lay an ambush.

163
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,810
Nothing suspicious is found.

164
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,670
That’s bad.

165
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,070
We wouldn’t know when he will appear.

166
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,380
I have an idea.

167
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,910
My beauty, wait right here for me.

168
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
Act accordingly.

169
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,990
Hello, little girl.

170
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,050
Hello, Uncle. Is there a candy shop around here?

171
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,260
Xiao Wu would like to have candies.

172
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,570
Xiao Wu, you’re such a cute girl.

173
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,230
Come with me. I’ll take you to buy candies.

174
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,100
Then I’ll send you home, okay?

175
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,650
Thank you, Uncle.

176
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,240
Come with me.

177
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,130
Little San, is that really Xiao Wu?

178
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,160
What is she planning?

179
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,870
This girl doesn’t change at all.

180
