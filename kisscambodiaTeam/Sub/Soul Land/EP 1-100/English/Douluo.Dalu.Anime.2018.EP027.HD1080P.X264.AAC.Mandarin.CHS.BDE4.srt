[Soul Land]
[Episode 27]

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,090
Ah Yin, here is the place we bade farewell.

22
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,130
<i>Martial Soul Hall.</i>

23
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,420
Be careful.

24
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,570
Your doom is due.

25
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,350
Tang Hao, you can’t escape.

26
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
His soul ring can’t be seen, only the shadow is here.

27
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,580
What a Grand Soul Land Master.

28
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,030
Ah Yin.

29
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,350
No.

30
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,010
No.

31
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,230
The Strike of Ling Tian.

32
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,850
Bright light can stop him for a while. Let’s go.

33
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,640
Go? Where are you going to?

34
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Oh, no.

35
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,890
Rare Powerful Chrysanthemum.
Another Grand Soul Land Master.

36
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:40,820
Wilted chrysanthemum brings pain.
Falling flowers bring misery.

37
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,330
Shield of Hao Tian.

38
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,260
Sixth soul skill, Clouds of Golden Pistil.

39
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,550
Hang in there, Ah Yin.

40
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,070
I’ll surely take you and the child
out of this valley.

41
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,490
Hao.

42
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,150
I’m here.

43
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,320
Thank you.

44
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,600
Finally.

45
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,950
Hao.

46
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,690
Almighty Pope.

47
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,030
Challenging is the soul hammer,
lofty is Hao Tian Tribe.

48
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,110
The heir of the world-best tribe

49
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,220
is going against God’s will.
This will be a disaster.

50
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,180
Going against God’s will?

51
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,470
Am I going against God’s will?

52
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,820
Or are you assuming yourself as God?

53
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,240
How dare you?

54
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,320
Three Grand Soul Land Masters.
Martial Soul Hall.

55
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,360
You only have 8 soul rings.
Why ask destruction to yourself?

56
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,210
Tang Hao, Martial Soul Hall doesn’t want
to be enemy of Hao Tian Tribe.

57
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,610
Give her to me. I’ll let you live.

58
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,490
If you want to hurt her,

59
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,500
step over my corpse first.

60
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,410
What a stubborn one.

61
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
The Sword of Angel Light.

62
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,590
Hammer of Hao Tian.
Skill of Random Hammering.

63
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,580
Unexpectedly, Skill of Random Hammering
is so powerful.

64
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,290
You’re indeed a rare genius of Hao Tian Tribe.

65
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,430
Bipolar Static Field.

66
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,660
<i>I can’t move.</i>

67
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,010
<i>Combination of Martial Soul.</i>

68
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,910
No one can stop Martial Soul Hall
from getting what it wants.

69
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,740
The Holy Sword of Angel.

70
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
This is the end, Tang Hao.

71
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,190
Your anger is the stepping stone to my peak.

72
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,100
Despicable.

73
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,980
Blue Plant doesn’t belong anywhere.

74
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,790
Fortunately, it was cared for
by the east wind during a hard time.

75
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,650
Ah Yin.

76
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,320
Hao, I have no regret loving you.

77
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,030
Always remember, this is our child.

78
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,100
No, Ah Yin. No.

79
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,610
Ah Yin.

80
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,700
No.

81
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,140
I know,

82
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,150
I can never survive in Martial Soul Hall.

83
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,880
That’s my fate. I can’t complain.

84
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,740
But before submitting myself to fate,

85
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,610
I want to have a deal with you.

86
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,140
You want to offer a sacrifice?

87
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,970
Do you know you’ll be destructed?

88
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,750
Ah Yin, no. Go with them.
Don’t offer a sacrifice.

89
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,650
Stop her. Take action, everyone.

90
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,230
Farewell, my love.

91
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,740
No.

92
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,250
[Soul Land]

93
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,380
Hao, you have to live on for him.

94
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,170
I’ve given him a name.

95
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,050
[San]

96
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,680
Little San might can’t withstand
this Human Faced Demon Spider.

97
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,650
Their levels are too different. It’s dangerous.

98
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,980
Little San has faced a situation of life and death.

99
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,780
Xiao Wu.

100
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,920
Brother.

101
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,720
Xiao Wu.

102
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,540
Brother.

103
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,870
<i>It was just a dream.</i>

104
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:01,240
Ah Yin, I’ve seen our son.

105
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,370
He has grown up. He looks more and more like you.

106
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,170
The girl called Xiao Wu is cute as well.

107
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,900
If you see her, you might like her too.

108
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:26,290
I hope they can live well. Not like us.

109
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,400
Don’t worry.

110
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,900
As long as I’m around, no one can harm them.

111
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,000
It’s enough to have our tragedy once.

112
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,710
Little San has met a trustworthy companion.

113
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,550
He also has a teacher who’s more
responsible and better to care for him.

114
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,390
I can do what I want to and must do without worry.

115
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,590
I have to pay back what I owed the tribe.

116
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,770
I also have to ask back
what Martial Soul Hall owed us.

117
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,060
I like this place a lot.

118
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,940
I wanted to stay here with you forever.

119
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,960
But I think it’s not possible now.

120
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,350
Don’t stop me, Ah Yin.

121
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,830
I promise you, I’ll be back soon.

122
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>To be able to meet you and have Little San with you</i>

123
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,090

124
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,080
<i>Martial Soul Hall, I’m back.</i>

[Next Episode]
Tang San

126
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,620
is a rare talent.

127
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,680
Yi Ran, what do you think of Tang San?

128
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,870
Grandpa, are you pairing us together?

129
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,010
If Little San carries on,

130
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,700
he may be in danger.

131
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,470
Do you think

132
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,880
Little San’s Martial Soul is only Blue Silver Plant?
