[Previous Episode]
He’s the War Soul Master from Nuoding City.

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,300
I’m going to awaken your Martial Soul one by one.

22
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,500
Lone Wolf,

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,890
join me!

24
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,830
It’s a useless Martial Soul.

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,620
No attack,

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,120
no defence...

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,960
or assisting ability.

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,570
No soul power.

29
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,810
Something in my body...

30
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,180
seems to be unlocked.

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,620
Blue Silver Plant is considered
standard for useless Martial Soul.

32
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,320
I’ve never seen anyone with Blue Silver Plant...

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,480
who has the soul power.

34
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,640
He’s born with full soul power!

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,040
Born with full soul power,

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
but with Blue Silver Plant.

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,270
[Soul Land]
[Episode 3]

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,940
Little San, what’s your Martial Soul?

39
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,560
It’s Blue Silver Plant, Dad.

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,860
<i>Is he...</i>

41
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,850
Even though it’s Blue Silver Plant,

42
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,090
But Little San was born with full soul power.

43
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,360
I’ve decided...

44
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,080
to give the only apprentice position
in our village to Little San...

45
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,640
to learn at Beginner Soul Master School
in Nuoding City.

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
We’ll take care of the travel fee.

47
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,530
Blue Silver Plant.

48
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,920
No way.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,810
What?

50
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,540
You should know this is a precious chance.

51
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,640
We get our this apprentice position...

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,330
because there was a Soul Saint
here in our village.

53
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,650
Others have to fight for a position
among two or three villages.

54
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,940
Are you aware of that?

55
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,420
By grabbing this chance,

56
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,640
Little San might be a successful person in the future.

57
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,050
What’s the use of being successful?

58
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,500
Who’s going to make me meals after he’s gone?

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,020
What can he train with Blue Silver Plant?

60
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,030
It’s just a useless Martial Soul.

61
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,090
But Little San was born with full soul power.

62
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,390
As long as he gets a soul ring,

63
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,200
even the worst can be trained as a soul master.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,060
Soul master, you see?

65
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,740
It has been years since we had a soul master.

66
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,480
This is your motive behind all this, right?

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,060
I said no.

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,440
Alright, you may leave now.

69
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,860
Tang Hao!

70
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,650
I can still hear, you don’t have to shout.

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,850
I said, you may leave.

72
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,890
You!

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,380
Grandpa Jack, don’t be angry. My father is right.

74
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,420
Blue Silver Plant is just a useless Martial Soul.

75
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,280
I think I’d better not learn
those soul masters’ abilities.

76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,580
Thank you for your kindness.

77
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,620
Good boy, I’m not angry.

78
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,360
Alright, I shall leave.

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,010
Tang Hao, you may have already given up,

80
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,470
but Little San is still young.

81
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,960
Don’t you think...

82
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,860
he deserves to learn some surviving skills?

83
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,460
Don’t stop him...

84
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,160
from becoming a soul master.

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,290
At least he won’t look down-and-out like you.

86
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,280
Come and look for me if you change your mind.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,330
There are three months to go
before the registration starts.

88
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,880
Little San, get me the beer.

89
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,450
Are you disappointed?

90
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,640
You want to be a soul master?

91
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,840
It’s alright, Dad. I’m fine with being a blacksmith.

92
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,720
We can still survive with that.

93
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,140
Didn’t you promise...

94
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,330
to teach me to make farm tools?

95
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,600
What’s the use of being a soul master?

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Not to mention a useless Martial Soul,

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,900
even the best Martial Soul...

98
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,520
and the strongest soul master...

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,700
are merely useless.

100
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,270
Don’t be angry, Dad.
I’m not going to be a soul master.

101
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,850
I’ll always accompany you and make meals for you.

102
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,860
Release your Martial Soul.

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
Alright.

104
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,360
<i>It’s the same as hers.</i>

105
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,260
Dad?

106
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,270
Stop bothering me!

107
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,690
But I still have another Martial Soul.

108
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,720
<i>Let them go, I’ll go with you.</i>

109
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,800
<i>No.</i>

110
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,140
<i>No, Ah Yin!</i>

111
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,750
<i>No!</i>

112
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,940
<i>Ah Yin!</i>

113
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,250
<i>No.</i>

114
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,820
This...

115
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,890
Is there anything wrong?

116
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,330
It’s Twin Martial Souls!

117
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,230
Son, my son.

118
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,690
Dad.

119
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,850
<i>This is the first time Dad hugs me.</i>

120
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,140
<i>It feels so warm.</i>

121
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,020
<i>Wait, why is my inner power
decreasing drastically?</i>

122
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,490
<i>I’ll hurt Dad if this goes on.</i>

123
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,030
Dad, I can’t hang on any more.

124
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,370
Withdraw it back.

125
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,690
Remember, in the future,

126
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,490
you must protect your plant with the hammer.

127
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,960
Forever.

128
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,720
Dad, I will. Promise.

129
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,130
It’s extremely rare to witness
Twin Martial Souls in this world.

130
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,060
Hang on.

131
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,620
If you continue to knock like this,
you won’t make it even after a year.

132
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,580
What should I do?

133
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,540
Look.

134
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,290
[Soul Land]

135
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,360
<i>Finally, the hidden weapon of Tang Clan is done.</i>

136
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,010
<i>Too bad, I’m lack of iron samples now.</i>

137
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,630
<i>Or else it would be perfect
if I can add a hook at the arrow tip.</i>

138
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,970
<i>For the past three months, Dad has been
teaching me the hammering skill,</i>

139
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,380
<i>I can strike twenty-four times continuously now.</i>

140
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,370
<i>Even the other strikes have great improvements.</i>

141
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,930
<i>It’s time to think about
Xuan Tian Strike’s problem.</i>

142
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,560
The porridge is ready.

143
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,990
Dad, let’s eat!

144
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,630
<i>Normally, Dad will come out by now,</i>

145
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,160
<i>has he fallen sick?</i>

146
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,010
<i>Where did he go this early?</i>

147
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,820
Dad, let’s eat.

148
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,940
Alright.

149
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,960
You don’t have to train to hammer today.

150
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,460
Pack your stuff,

151
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,100
and Old Jack will bring you
to Nuoding City tomorrow.

152
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,530
Nuoding City?

153
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,280
For what?

154
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,630
Don’t you want to learn to be a soul master?

155
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,150
Old Jack will bring you to
the Beginner Soul Master School.

156
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,180
You’ll learn what you want there.

157
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,120
Dad, why did you change your mind?

158
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,900
Are you going or not?

159
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,080
So Dad went out this morning
to look for the village head.

160
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,290
But no one will make meals for you then.

161
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,070
Do you think I really need you? Just go.

162
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,990
You chose this path.

163
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,850
Just use the hammering method I taught you...

164
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,360
to be an apprentice in a blacksmith shop there.

165
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,340
It should be enough to cover
your school fees and meals.

166
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,460
I won’t let you go to Nuoding City so easily.

167
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,480
Promise me something before you go.

168
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,670
I promise.

169
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,610
You didn’t even ask what I want,
yet you’d already agreed.

170
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,200
As a man,

171
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,700
you must mean what you say.

172
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,890
Don’t break your promise.

173
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,340
No matter what you ask, I’ll say yes.

174
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,410
It’s definitely for my own good.

175
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,540
Alright, I want you to promise me,

176
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,980
no matter how you train your soul power,

177
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,650
never add any soul ring to that hammer.

178
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,220
No one should know about its existence,

179
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,220
and the fact that you have Twin Martial Souls.

180
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Can...

181
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,200
you do it?

182
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
What about Blue Silver Plant?

183
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,440
You can use that whenever you want.

184
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,740
For Twin Martial Souls,

185
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,070
you can proceed training
even you only have one soul ring.

186
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,940
Any problem with your soul power will be solved.

187
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,160
That means...

188
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,980
I can only use Blue Silver Plant, right?

189
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,490
Unless it’s a life-and-death matter,

190
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,680
never use the hammer!

191
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,010
Alright, got it.

192
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,620
Alright, let’s eat.

193
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,700
Little San, have you packed up?

194
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,060
That’s too loud, Grandpa Jack.

195
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,160
My dad is still sleeping.

196
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,680
He most dislikes being disturbing
while he sleeps.

197
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,010
Kid,

198
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,010
you’re still worrying about
your dad’s breakfast upon leaving?

199
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,790
Grandpa Jack, give me another minute.

200
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,690
<i>Dad, I’m going with Grandpa Jack.</i>

201
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,590
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

202
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,920
<i>Don’t forget the porridge in the pot.</i>

203
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,340
Little San, will you miss the village...

204
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,650
or your drunken dad more?

205
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,480
Both.

206
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,110
Grandpa Jack, can you tell me about the school?

207
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,380
Of course, what would you like to know?

208
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,610
Dad asked me to work with a blacksmith
after getting into the school.

209
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:59,200
Working in a blacksmith shop?
Is he kidding?

210
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,730
Tang Hao must be crazy.

211
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,480
You’re too young for that.

212
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,280
Just study hard at school.

213
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,820
If you really are capable,

214
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,140
you should ask your dad
to earn some money for you.

215
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,400
We don’t have any more position
for Intermediate Soul Master School.

216
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
That costs quite some amount of money.

217
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,900
There’s Intermediate Soul Master School?

218
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,910
Of course!

219
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:28,170
[Next Episode]

220
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,270
Are villagers even allowed to be here?

221
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,070
Get lost.

222
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,100
The third Twin Martial Souls in a hundred year.

223
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,130
What?

224
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,290
Born with full soul power?

225
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,760
People will just laugh at him.
