20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,780
[Previous Episode] The background of
Emperor Team is overwhelming!

21
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,980
During the battle,

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,500
we must focus on

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
the soul master of Assisting Branch
of the opponent.

24
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,750
This is an almost perfect combination.

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,610
This time, you’re going to
encounter a strong opponent.

26
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,580
We can win.

27
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,470
In the previous battles,

28
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,710
we won by defeating the strong opponents.

29
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,680
We, Shrek Seven Devils
are never afraid of anyone else.

30
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,910
Yes, Shrek Seven Devils will surely win.

31
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,150
Win!

32
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,260
Soul battle begins.

33
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,580
[Soul Land]
[Episode 40]

34
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,000
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,480
He is indeed powerful.

36
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,120
Remember.

37
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,110
Only by combining all your strength,

38
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,070
you can make up the gap
between the capability difference.

39
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,020
<i>It’s odd.</i>

40
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,920
<i>How can he control every strand
of Blue Silver Plant like his limbs?</i>

41
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,620
<i>Pulling requires strength.</i>

42
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,540
<i>It isn’t easy to control it well.</i>

43
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,350
<i>Let alone controlling six teammates
at the same time.</i>

44
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,130
<i>It’s hard to control Blue Silver Plant
only by strength.</i>

45
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,320
<i>But I have the skill from Tang Clan,
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.</i>

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,670
<i>I have the whole situation in control.</i>

47
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,380
<i>Teacher is right. You should
be paid more attention.</i>

48
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,410
<i>Thunder Dragon Claws.</i>

49
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,120
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

50
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,930
<i>Oh, no, I’m tricked.</i>

51
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,530
Our opponent’s level is too much higher than ours.

52
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,630
Therefore, we can’t have a head-on fight.

53
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,490
Brother San, what idea do you have?

54
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,060
The key to victory is on him.

55
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,040
Yu Tian Heng?

56
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,730
His strength is very mighty.

57
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,710
He’s the captain of Emperor Team,

58
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,590
and the sharpest spear of Emperor Team.

59
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,940
If we can first break this spear,

60
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,740
the scale of victory and defeat will be tilted.

61
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,420
But how should we defeat him?

62
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,160
Yu Tian Heng is from
the clan of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

63
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,190
He must be very arrogant.

64
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,490
We can take advantage of this.

65
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,910
<i>Little San, you’re indeed an expert in tactics.</i>

66
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,650
<i>Using Mu Bai’s attack as a bait,</i>

67
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,990
<i>and Blue Silver Plant is used to
help Mu Bai neutralize his attack.</i>

68
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,470
<i>That’s not just for saving Mu Bai,</i>

69
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,740
<i>most importantly, it is to attract
Yu Tian Heng’s attention</i>

70
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,410
<i>to yourself.</i>

71
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,280
<i>Lure the enemy into depth.</i>

72
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,140
<i>As the captain of Emperor Team,</i>

73
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,390
<i>you’re indeed calm, reliable and strong.</i>

74
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,980
<i>However, in your heart,</i>

75
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,700
<i>while facing this obviously weaker team,</i>

76
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,300
<i>you’re indeed a little reckless.</i>

77
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,670
<i>You’re tricked eventually.</i>

78
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,530
<i>Tian Heng, the pride of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon
makes you belittle your opponent.</i>

79
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,350
Intertwine.

80
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,990
Excellent combination.

81
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,190
How can Yu Tian Heng overcome this plight?

82
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,160
<i>I’m waiting for this moment.</i>

83
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,760
<i>I don’t have to retreat.</i>

84
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,090
<i>Your joint attack</i>

85
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,760
<i>is the chance for me
to destroy all of you in a blow.</i>

86
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,620
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

87
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,910
Fury of Thunderbolt.

88
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,800
Is this really a soul battle among Soul Honors?

89
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,920
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon
shouldn’t be looked down upon.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,130
<i>Powerful. Blue Silver Plant
doesn’t conduct electricity normally.</i>

91
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,140
<i>But the energy of Fury of Thunderbolt
is too humongous.</i>

92
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,540
<i>Blue Silver Plant can’t take it.</i>

93
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,360
<i>The tactic of luring enemy
of Shrek Seven Devil was effective,</i>

94
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,480
<i>but it has also put them in crisis.</i>

95
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,290
<i>Fury of Thunderbolt of Tian Heng
can double the power of lightning.</i>

96
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,490
<i>His second soul skill,
Mighty Thunderbolt, has a bursting attack.</i>

97
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,850
<i>It can injure Shrek Seven Devils
in all dimensions.</i>

98
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,980
Pretending to progress while retreating.

99
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,860
However,

100
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,790
Shrek Seven Devils can win all 27 battles

101
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,830
in Suo Tuo Soul Arena,

102
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,050
they won’t be defeated so easily.

103
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,570
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Martial Soul is brutal,

104
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,850
but you’re fighting alone after all.

105
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,770
<i>Mighty Thunderbolt may be frightening,</i>

106
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,200
<i>but it attacks in all dimension.</i>

107
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,630
<i>Mu Bai’s attack is monosomic.</i>

108
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,540
<i>In coherence of soul power,
White Tiger Intense Light Wave is more superior.</i>

109
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,160
<i>But Yu Tian Heng has only fallen
one step further back than Mu Bai.</i>

110
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,370
<i>Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon
is apparently very overbearing.</i>

111
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,690
Due to the fire wall,
teammates of Emperor Team can’t help.

112
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,940
<i>Although Xiao Wu’s soul power is eight levels
lower than the opponent,</i>

113
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,210
<i>Tian Heng’s body condition is at its worst.</i>

114
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,980
<i>Xiao Wu has an increment of 30%
with the help of Qibao Amber Pagoda.</i>

115
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,500
<i>Tian Heng can’t resist Xiao Wu’s Rou Skill.</i>

116
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,180
First soul skill, Arched Body.

117
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,200
<i>From Tian Heng overtook
Black Martial Turtle to attack,</i>

118
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,370
<i>to Shrek Seven Devils completed the surround</i>

119
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,970
<i>to inflict Tian Heng,</i>

120
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,820
<i>all of these only are done within little time.</i>

121
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,480
<i>However, this is the key moment.</i>

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,980
I’ll kill you all!

123
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,060
No, Yan Zi.
Do not use Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom.

124
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,240
Dugu Yan’s best skill,
Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom.

125
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,140
<i>The venom of Jade Phosphor Serpent
is extremely venomous.</i>

126
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,090
<i>Even Tian Heng is strong, he wouldn’t touch it.</i>

127
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,940
<i>Let alone that she released the venom
with third soul skill,</i>

128
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,240
<i>the toxin will be in effect very quickly.</i>

129
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,410
<i>Once touched by the venomous fog,</i>

130
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,810
<i>that part will be inflamed immediately.</i>

131
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,700
<i>It’s indeed Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom.</i>

132
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,970
<i>This girl is just like him, cruel and vicious.</i>

133
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,590
<i>Don’t know if Little San...</i>

134
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,970
Get back.

135
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,470
<i>Yan Zi is a little lazy normally,</i>

136
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,280
<i>but when someone hurts Yu Tian Heng,</i>

137
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,070
<i>she’ll be infuriated.</i>

138
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,660
<i>Now she has forgotten my deploy.</i>

139
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,200
<i>The lives of Shrek Seven Devils are at stake.</i>

140
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
Are the little monsters okay?

141
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,370
<i>It’s just the Jade Phosphor Serpent
of the Five Toxins Jade Phosphor.</i>

142
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,660
<i>See how I neutralize your venom.</i>

143
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,410
Boss. Fatty.

144
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,610
Pointless struggle.

145
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,740
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

146
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,220
Phoenix Firing Line.

147
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,990
It’s alcohol.

148
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,230
No, this is impossible.

149
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,800
How could you neutralize
my Jade Phosphor Purple Venom?

150
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,630
Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom
is just an insignificant skill.

151
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,210
<i>Venom is the unique skill of Tang Clan.</i>

152
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,260
I added realgar powder into the alcohol.

153
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,290
Then it’s ignited by Fire of Phoenix.

154
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,610
Although the serpent venom is strong,
it can be neutralized.

155
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,430
<i>Turns out there’s such an intelligent way
to neutralize it.</i>

156
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,420
Do these small obstacles
make you afraid of the opponents?

157
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,230
<i>Nine Heart Flowering Apple.</i>

158
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,880
<i>Nine Heart Flowering Apple.</i>

159
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,560
<i>We’ve neglected
the existence of this soul master.</i>

160
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,430
That’s not good.

161
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,450
Shrek Seven Devils could strike first,

162
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,450
because they took advantage
of their recklessness.

163
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,110
But this time, we’re the reckless ones.

164
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,050
Shrek Seven Devils have good teamwork.

165
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,420
But Emperor Team isn’t half a penny worse.

166
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,370
<i>Ling Ling is usually cool and detached.</i>

167
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,620
<i>In fact, she cares about her partner
more than anyone else.</i>

168
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,690
<i>Because of the recovery power of
Ling Ling’s Nine Heart Flowering Apple,</i>

169
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,550
<i>Tian Heng and the others
can charge forward without worries.</i>

170
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,900
<i>You’re reckless. Though Jade Phosphor
Serpent Venom lost its function,</i>

171
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,340
<i>it has gained the most crucial time.</i>

172
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,340
Oh, no.

173
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,180
Ling Ling is right.
What are we waiting for? Fight!

174
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,620
<i>The favorable situation
that Little San established is useless now.</i>

175
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,120
<i>The real battle starts now!</i>

176
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,930
It’s venomous gas. Oscar!

177
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,700
<i>His body isn’t recovered to his best condition.</i>

178
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,940
<i>Although his wounds are healed,
his soul power isn’t recovered.</i>

179
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,270
<i>His fractures didn’t heal completely either.</i>

180
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,000
<i>The Black Panther soul master
is faster than Zhu Qing.</i>

181
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,630
<i>Besides, his attack is fierce.</i>

182
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,410
<i>He wants to use up Zhu Qing’s soul power
with continuous attacks.</i>

183
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,610
<i>Osler may be arrogant,</i>

184
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,710
<i>but his tactic is implemented thoroughly.</i>

185
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,230
<i>Especially when he faces
opponents of the same type.</i>

186
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,510
<i>His nature of breaking the opponent completely</i>

187
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,020
<i>is released.</i>

188
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,590
<i>The angle of attack is cunning.</i>

189
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,330
<i>This person looks smiley.</i>

190
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,970
<i>Why is he so cunning?</i>

191
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,620
<i>The opponents that Zhu Qing and Hong Jun
face have way higher soul power.</i>

192
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,580
<i>Despite the help of Qibao Amber Pagoda,</i>

193
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,820
<i>the gap of a soul ring can’t be made up.</i>

194
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,630
<i>An extra soul ring isn’t just about
an extra soul skill.</i>

195
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,150
<i>When the soul ring is absorbed,
everything is improved comprehensively.</i>

196
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,590
<i>Black Martial Turtle soul master
has undoubtedly the shell as defence.</i>

197
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,260
<i>Now that the shell is here,</i>

198
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,210
<i>their defence will decrease greatly.</i>

199
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,510
<i>The turtle shell is cutting Silver Blue Plant.</i>

200
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,300
<i>Black Martial Turtle and Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon
are both top Martial Souls.</i>

201
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,480
<i>It seems the Shi Brothers
are stronger than imagined.</i>

202
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,350
<i>All along, the most eye-catching
one in Emperor Team</i>

203
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,550
<i>is the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon soul master,
Captain Yu Tian Heng.</i>

204
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,420
<i>But in terms of the combat ability,</i>

205
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,490
<i>Shi Brothers aren’t much worse than Tian Heng.</i>

206
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,780
<i>Without turtle shells,
how will you defend yourself?</i>

207
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,500
Xiao Wu, watch out!

208
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,600
<i>Oh, no! Xiao Wu can’t move in the air.</i>

209
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,600
No!

210
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,360
<i>I promised you, I’ll protect you forever.</i>

211
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,910
<i>Brother.</i>

212
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,860
<i>Xiao Wu.</i>

213
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,510
Xiao Wu.

214
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,750
No!

215
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,930
Xiao Wu.

216
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,860
Brother.

217
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,460
Don’t talk.

218
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,870
<i>Xuan Tian Strike has protected
your cardiopulmonary arteries.</i>

219
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,440
<i>The blood has been stopped.</i>

220
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,910
How dare you injure Xiao Wu?

221
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,870
<i>What’s going on?</i>

222
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,570
<i>Surprisingly, I feel a unique pressure from him.</i>

223
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,330
Third soul skill, Raging Storm.

224
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,320
[Next Episode]

225
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
The toxin is getting near the cardiac artery.

226
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,510
That’s the fact.

227
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,540
Comparing your actual strength,

228
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,820
you’re no match to Emperor Team.

229
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,480
Alright, Frander. That’s enough.

230
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,070
The kids have worked hard lately.

231
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,710
You are...

232
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,010
Frander, I’ve repeated many times.

233
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,500
I have nothing to do

234
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,050
with Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe anymore.
