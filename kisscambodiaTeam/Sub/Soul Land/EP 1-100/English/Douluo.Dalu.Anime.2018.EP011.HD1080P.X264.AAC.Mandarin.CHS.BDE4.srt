Grandmaster.

21
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,170
Tang Hao!

22
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,900
I wish to entrust Little San to you.

23
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,250
Please always remember that he is my son.

24
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,860
Xiao Wu, would you like to be my sister?

25
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,020
I’m just a peasant.

26
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,030
I can give you neither wealth nor power.

27
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,940
But I can give you my promise.

28
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,240
I’ll protect my younger sister forever.

29
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,400
I won’t let her get hurt.

30
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,580
Brother.

31
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,660
I don’t know what’s the Grandmaster thinking.

32
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,150
There are several intermediate schools
that want to recruit us unconditionally.

33
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,480
However, he kept asking you
to enroll in Shrek School....

34
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,910
which has no rank at all.

35
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,790
This room should belong to me, right?

36
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,080
Buddy, I think we came first.

37
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,840
So what?

38
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,470
Nothing. We just want you to get out.

39
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,760
I’ll give you a chance to get me out.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 11]

41
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,110
Please.

42
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,370
<i>Very strong.</i>

43
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,570
Great! Able to hold my punch!
You’re qualified to be my opponent!

44
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,500
<i>To no avail to hit hard.
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.</i>

45
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,780
<i>My body is being absorbed toward him.</i>

46
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,650
<i>Ghostly Trace.</i>

47
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,120
<i>So fast!</i>

48
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,620
<i>Ouch! Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.</i>

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,970
<i>Oops!</i>

50
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,870
Shall we continue?

51
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,420
Sure!

52
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,860
You did force me to use soul power.
I lost this battle.

53
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,850
However, how can I let it be
if I don’t battle once again?

54
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,650
White Tiger Shield Body.

55
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,700
Millennium soul ring.

56
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,750
Dai Mu Bai. White Tiger Martial Soul.

57
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,110
War Soul Master of Level 37. Please.

58
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,050
Tang San. Blue Silver Plant Martial Soul.

59
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,020
Tool Soul Master of Level 29. Please.

60
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,260
Blue Silver Plant.

61
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,890
Are you looking down on Blue Silver Plant?

62
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,610
Martial soul is wasted with a waste soul master.

63
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,050
You’re right!

64
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,450
Martial soul is wasted with a waste soul master.

65
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,940
Show me how peculiar your Blue Silver Plant is.

66
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,730
<i>Inseparable.</i>

67
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,420
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

68
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,290
Tang San. The attack power of a beast soul
is always stronger than a tool soul.

69
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,530
The power of your Blue Silver Plant
is beyond my expectation,

70
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,700
but it can’t trap me at all.

71
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,830
That’s not a must.

72
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,160
The Blue Silver Plant is poisonous.

73
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,490
While you launched strong soul skill
to break my intertwine,

74
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,380
the toxin has already penetrated into your body.

75
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,680
You might feel paralysis all over now.

76
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,410
You lost this battle.

77
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,440
What a great Blue Silver Plant.

78
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,740
If I have only two soul rings,

79
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,850
indeed I did lose.

80
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,150
But...

81
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,970
Just let me show you the skill
of my third soul ring!

82
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,890
White Tiger Vajra Transformation.

83
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,840
<i>Is this the millennium soul ring?</i>

84
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,330
The toughness of Blue Silver Plant
is indeed beyond my expectation.

85
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,810
Even my normal soul power can’t cut it all at once.

86
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,680
But I’m now using the skill of my third soul ring,

87
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,690
White Tiger Vajra Transformation.

88
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,870
The White Tiger Vajra Transformation
can retain for half an hour.

89
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,250
In this half an hour,

90
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,190
the attribute of all aspects will be doubled.

91
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,220
With my soul power of Level 37...

92
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,560
and the strengthening of
White Tiger Vajra Transformation,

93
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,980
the toxin won’t hurt me.

94
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,810
Even you own subtle soul skill...

95
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,410
and great martial soul of controlling branch,

96
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,250
you’re still not my opponent.

97
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,370
This shows the great
differences of our strengths.

98
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,240
I think that we will meet again soon.

99
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,670
If there’s someone troubles on you...

100
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,840
in Shrek School,

101
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,910
you can tell them my name,
Evil Eyes White Tiger — Dai Mu Bai.

102
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,390
How did you know we’re going to Shrek School?

103
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,150
I’ll wait for you in Shrek.

104
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,210
Huh! This person is inexplicable!

105
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,850
He’s not a good guy.

106
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,770
Little San, when we get into Shrek School,

107
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,830
we don’t mingle with him.

108
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,910
I think this person is pretty good.

109
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,950
Although a bit cold on the surface,
he is straightforward.

110
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,750
What I see as bad cannot be mistaken.

111
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,190
You said he took two girls to rent a room at the hotel.

112
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,310
Still capable of what good deed?

113
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,200
What Evil-Eyes White Tiger?

114
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,510
I think it’s more like Lewd Tiger.

115
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,230
Xiao Wu, I find you understand more and more.

116
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,230
Of course.

117
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,130
Don’t forget that I was
the boss of Nuoding School.

118
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,790
I’m not going to evaluate
Dai Mu Bai’s personal preferences.

119
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,920
But about the battle just now,

120
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
he’s good at every aspect.

121
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,770
His strength is beyond us,
but he didn’t bully us.

122
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,630
He shows his intention on
taking care of us before he left.

123
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,240
Take care of us?

124
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,820
Oh, yes! He did mention that he lost.

125
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,270
What does it mean?

126
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,350
Him? If I got it right,

127
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,390
he is also a combative person.

128
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,760
What does it mean?

129
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,350
Nothing. Let’s check in first.

130
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,740
Brother, if you lost the battle just now,

131
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,000
would we really get out of here?

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,110
Even so, I would be the only one who leaves.

133
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,320
That’s why I didn’t allow you to get involved.

134
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,940
He said it right. One soul ring apart...

135
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,110
did keep an enormous difference
between our strengths.

136
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,040
When he used
White Tiger Vajra Transformation,

137
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,460
we’re still not his opponent
even we joined hand together.

138
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,300
Don’t you worry.

139
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,870
If he insisted on getting you out,

140
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,930
I’d fight against him deadly.

141
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,750
If I got to fight against him again,

142
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,550
I have 70% certainty to put him to death.

143
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,830
Fight against him deadly?

144
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,710
This hotel...

145
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,070
It seems to be exclusively for couples on dates.

146
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,830
It doesn’t matter to stay here.

147
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,320
[Soul Land]

148
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,390
Why didn’t you... move forward?

149
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,370
It seems that I got it right.
No wonder Dai Mubai wants to bring a girl here.

150
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,590
Xiao Wu, if don’t like it,

151
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,580
I’ll ask the waiter to take away these flowers.

152
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,500
Brother, how stupid you are!

153
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,060
There isn’t any girl who dislikes roses.

154
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,270
If you’re doing this, how can you get your wife then?

155
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,990
It’s still too early to talk about this now.

156
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,430
This room is really well decorated.

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,710
I realize that I’ve fallen in love with this place.

158
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,830
Brother, can we come here again in the future?

159
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,350
How good is it? We are siblings.

160
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,990
What good is it to come to this place?

161
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,190
We have a long journey.
Let’s have a rest.

162
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,650
Xiao Wu, I think it’s a mistake to
listen to you and come here.

163
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,860
You rest here. I’ll rest on the sofa there.

164
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,150
<i>The golden light ray seems to be radon.</i>

165
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,230
<i>Tang Clan has several hidden
weapons that can destroy it.</i>

166
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,380
<i>Unsure whether it’ll work.</i>

167
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,150
You’re from Blacksmith Clan.
Why are you coming to Tang Clan?

168
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,650
Do you believe if I say that
I’m here to enjoy the scenery?

169
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,810
Anyone who breaks into Tang Clan...

170
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,900
will be killed without pardon.

171
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,800
This is a hair crystal.

172
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,130
Little San, why are you looking at this poor crystal?

173
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,400
Are you planning to buy this thing?

174
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,070
Yes, but I don’t know how much is it.

175
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,160
It’s not expensive. 100 gold soul coins.

176
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,900
This poor crystal costs 100 gold soul coins?
It’s better to snatch!

177
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,800
100 gold soul coins is the lowest price here.

178
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,410
If you want to buy, pay it. Or, please leave here.

179
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,340
All right. I’ll buy it.

180
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,320
Little San, are you all right?

181
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,520
That is not enough.

182
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,730
This is 100 gold soul coins. No wrong.

183
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,090
I’m selling it for 200 gold soul coins.

184
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,090
You’re cheating!

185
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,570
You said 100 just now,
and now it turns to 200.

186
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,780
No wonder you have no dealing.

187
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,920
Little San, don’t buy it. Let’s go.

188
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
Are you going to change your mind?

189
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,340
Okay, 500 gold soul coins.
No change.

190
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,030
Let’s go.

191
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,510
We should have left earlier.

192
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,360
Dealing with this dishonest trader
is really insulting.

193
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,680
If you have no enough coins now,

194
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,080
I can collect 200 gold soul coins first.

195
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,390
You can pay the remaining

196
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,490
for 10 coins monthly with 10% of interest.

197
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,950
Dishonest trader!
Why don’t you go to hell?

198
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,830
<i>10 coins per month?</i>

199
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,660
<i>He knows that I’m a soul master.</i>

200
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,080
<i>- I didn’t feel the soul power of him.</i>
- Money makes a person blind.

202
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,790
Xiao Wu, hurry!

203
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,220
Help me collect all the gold granules quickly.

204
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,630
Don’t miss even one.

205
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,870
Mu Bai, someone is claiming for
a refund. Settle it.

206
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,920
Fully refund if he can defeat me in a battle.

207
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,150
Did your family know that you’re here?
