00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,570
Where did you get this belt?

22
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,340
My master gave it to me.

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,750
Take the crystal with you.

24
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,220
<i>Does he know Master?</i>

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,390
Brother. What on Earth is this crystal?

26
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,580
This is a hair crystal.

27
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,900
Look.

28
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,670
Once the hair gold penetrates
into the human body,

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,520
unless using some special tactics,

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,170
otherwise, you’ll have to cut off
the muscles that are curled up.

31
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,320
In this world, it’s not the weapon
that decides its vice.

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,540
It’s up to the person who uses it.

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,910
It’s impossible. This is a soul master school?

The meaning of Shrek School...

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
is a monster school.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,730
We only accept “monsters” but not ordinary people.

37
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,620
Teacher, the two of us want to register.

It’s only 5 copper soul coins for one.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,530
Uncle. Please give me two sausages.

56
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,850
What did you call me?

57
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,850
I called you uncle. Is there a problem?

58
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,790
Of course, it’s a big problem.

59
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,580
I am still so young, yet you called me that.

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,250
Are you young?

61
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,360
Of course! I am a student of the school.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Anyone else would know that I am still a student.

68
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,950
Senior, I’m sorry. I was rude just now.

It’s all right.

70
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,200
Just buy sausages from me more often.

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
No problem.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,130
Tang San. What are you doing?

73
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,360
Boss Dai, do you want to have a sausage?

74
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,900
Goodness. What a shame of the school.

75
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,240
I remembered that I warned you more than once.

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,650
Don’t sell sausages in the school.

77
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,970
Do you want everyone to vomit?

78
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,660
Tang San. You can’t eat this sausage.

79
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,750
Why?

80
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,010
Little Ao, give me a new sausage.

81
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,380
Boss Dai, I don’t think so.

82
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,530
Anyways, we’re classmates for years.

83
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,920
You’ll make the juniors have grudges against me.

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,020
I am just reminding Tang San.

85
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,910
Tang San is my brother. You can’t fool him.

90
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,300
you have to accompanied with soul curse.

91
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,840
This is a curse. I didn’t mean to shout it.

92
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,780
But, you can rest assured.
The quality of sausages is no problem.

93
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,030
You shall save the sausages for yourself.

94
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,150
Brother Dai. Thanks for reminding.

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
What a pity to my delicious sausages.

96
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,910
No one wants to eat it.

97
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,970
You’d better be careful.

98
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,320
Do it outside of the school.

99
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,730
Where is my sausage?

100
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,980
Silly.

101
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,400
What happened?
Doesn’t the sausage taste good?

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,770
These boys are too bad.

103
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,760
Why is there such a weird Martial Soul?

104
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,480
This is a monster school.

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,630
Of course, the Martial Souls are weird.

106
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,360
Don’t judge Oscar from his appearance.

107
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,480
His Martial Soul is the top of
Food Branch Martial Soul.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,850
The top?

109
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,500
After all he provides meat.

110
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,270
You’ll know it in the future.

111
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,830
Oh, right.

112
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,550
He has a nickname in the school.

113
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,410
Uncle Sausage.

114
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,720
Let’s go. I’ll bring you to pass the exam.

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,890
Don’t have to queue.

116
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,620
This is not appropriate.

117
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,150
Rest assured. I am not playing favoritism.

118
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,360
This is what you deserve.

119
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,830
Let’s go to the fourth exam straightaway.

120
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,530
What is this?

121
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,200
Why can they skip the test
to enter the fourth exam...

122
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,190
but we have to pass exam by exam?

123
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,930
If your soul power has exceeded Level 25,

124
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,480
you can go directly to the fourth exam.

125
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,420
What?

126
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,370
Their soul powers have exceeded Level 25?

127
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,470
It’s impossible. We’re at the same age.

128
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,380
how can they have such a high level soul power?

129
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,820
Exactly! It must be fake!

130
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,450
Don’t think others can’t do it
when you can’t do it yourself.

131
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,980
When I entered the school,

132
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,030
my soul power was also Level 25.

133
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,890
Tang San. Show them your soul power!

134
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,290
His soul power has already reached Level 29?

135
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,690
Level 29 at our age?

136
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,010
Can this be achieved by a man?

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,330
Another Level 29? Goodness! What is this?

138
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,470
I think I can also skip the second and third exams.

139
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,450
How is it? Two of them are at Level 29.

140
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,030
One at Level 26 and another one at Level 27.

141
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,170

143
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,600
What?

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,630
Your school only have 3 students now?

145
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,090
Yes. There are only 3 students including me.

146
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,540
In the whole Soul Land,

147
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,230
we are the only school
with more teachers than students.

148
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,490
The school was established for 20 years.
There were only 42 students enrolled.

149
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,130
Averagely,

150
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,570
it seems that there are
about two students every year.

151
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,200
How did the school survive?

152
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,450
If there’s no new students,
there won’t be income.

153
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,490
Why do you think the school
is located in this small village?

154
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,180
It’s due to the shortage of funds.

155
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,710
If my family didn’t sponsor,

156
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,260
the school might have closed last year.

157
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,370
If we can’t enroll any students this year,

158
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,950
the three of us studying...

159
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,300
will be the last batch of students
in Shrek School.

160
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,690
Why not loosen the admission requirement?

161
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,840
There are many people who came for registration.

162
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,760
The Dean of our school said,
put quality before quantity.

163
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,720
Even if Shrek School has to be closed,

164
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,500
it won’t accept trash but only monster.

165
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,350
Do you want to know
the graduation requirement?

166
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,720
What is it?

167
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,010
Your soul power has to exceed Level 40
before 20 years old...

168
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,450
and reach the level of Soul Sect
in order to graduate.

169
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,190
Exceeds Level 40?

170
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,620
Yes. Exceeds Level 40.

171
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,010
Ever since the school was established,
only 14 people graduated.

172
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,800
After these 14 people graduated,

173
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,010
all of them are notable figures.

174
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,170
One of the most outstanding person...

175
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,840
is now the youngest elder
in the Martial Soul Hall.

176
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,220
His authority is second to the Pope.

177
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,990
For those who couldn’t graduate,

178
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,410
some of them couldn’t manage
to complete practice to Level 40,

179
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,090
some others passed away
while hunting for soul beasts.

180
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,520
The Dean of our school said that...

181
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,010
don’t go out and shame him
if you can’t reach Level 41.

182
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,910
I am grateful to be here.

183
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,340
Initially, the royal family of Barak Kingdom
wanted to sponsor the school...

184
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,750
with the condition that
graduates need serve the royal family,

185
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,090
which was rejected by the Dean.

186
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,890
Our Shrek School is incompatible
with other schools...

187
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,460
and was excluded.

188
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,910
So, it became what it is now.

189
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,470
<i>What kind of person is the Dean of the school?</i>

190
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,110
We’re here.

191
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Teacher Zhao. I bring them here
to undergo the fourth exam.

192
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,990
This year, we have students for the fourth exam.

193
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,200
And four students.

194
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,510
They exempted the second and third exams.

195
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,020
Four of them have exceeded Level 25.

196
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,640
Not bad.

197
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,530
Seems like there are quite
a number of monsters.

198
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,000
I am Zhao Wu Ji.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,510
Since four of you have exempted
the second and third exams,

200
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,230
let me play with all of you.

201
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,260
I’ll give you half an hour
to know each other and discuss.

202
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,110
Half an hour later,

203
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,810
all of you team up to resist my attack
for half and hour.

204
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,080
As long as one of you
can persist to the end,

205
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
you will pass this exam.

206
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,580
But, the last part of the test...

207
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,790
is not that easy to pass.

208
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,970
Teacher Zhao, this is not quite good.

209
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,190
Why?

210
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,660
Dean of the school isn’t here, so I am the leader.

211
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,200
I make the decision.

212
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,810
Teacher.

213
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,770
Don’t say it anymore.
Using this half and hour,

214
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,460
you tell them my strength and characteristics.

215
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,400
I hope that you understand. Don’t try to trick.

216
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,500
No one can escape from my attack area.

217
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,410
At the same time, I can also remind you.

218
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,120
You won’t be able to resist my attack alone.

219
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,490
Coordination is the only chance
for you to succeed.

220
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,130
I didn’t expect Teacher Zhao would do it personally.

221
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,810
Teacher Zhao is the same as
the teacher at the entrance.

222
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,270
He’s also an outstanding soul master of
the Soul Emperor level.

223
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,890
No.

224
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,070
Then, there’s nothing to fear.

225
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,610
Anyway, four of us are almost at Level 30.

226
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,680
Four to one. It won’t be too hard
to persist for half and hour.

227
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,590
You don’t be too happy yet.
I haven’t finish my words.

228
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,800
Teacher Zhao is not a Soul Emperor.

229
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,090
But he is a Soul Saint.

230
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,620
He’s a beast soul, War Soul Saint of Level 76.

231
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,220
In the school, Teacher Zhao’s strength
is second to the Dean.

232
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,050
Level 76?

233
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,120
Level 76, Soul Saint.

234
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,970
Master has mentioned this before.

235
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,800
Soul Saint can survive in an army of
ten thousand people with great ease.

236
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,770
He is at Level 76?

237
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,180
But he looks far younger than
the teacher at the entrance.

238
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,170
Age? Age has never meant anything.

239
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,690
Not much time left.

240
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,480
I’ll briefly tell you Teacher Zhao’s strength.

241
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,310
You have to come out
with a strategy against him.

242
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,740
Or else, let alone half an hour,

243
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,430
you wouldn’t even be able
to take his first attack.

244
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,510
Initially, Teacher Zhao only
takes charge of the fourth exam.

245
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,640
Your opponent should be me.

246
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,440
You just have to persist
half an hour fighting with me.

247
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,830
You will be passed.

248
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,940
But he is behaving abnormal today.

249
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,570
He wants to do it himself.

250
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,700
Teacher Zhao’s Martial Soul is Supreme Bear.

251
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,220
It’s a super power beast soul.
He’s completely flawless.

252
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,720
Its defense is extremely terrifying.

253
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,180
Even the soul masters at his level...

254
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,040
can hardly hurt him.

255
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,580
Flawless.

256
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,540
Speed was Teacher Zhao’s weak point.

257
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,900
But there’s a big difference between
your soul power and his,

258
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,500
so this weak point is worthless to you.

259
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,680
Teacher Zhao has a nickname in the school,

260
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,390
Acala.

261
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,410
[Next Episode]
Ning Rong Rong will assist three of us.

262
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,290
Xiao Wu will be the main attack.

263
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,480
I will control Teacher Zhao’s attack.

264
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,280
Zhu Zhu Qing, pin him down from the flanks.

265
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,450
<i>Unexpectedly, this little boy
made me feel a little uneasy.</i>
