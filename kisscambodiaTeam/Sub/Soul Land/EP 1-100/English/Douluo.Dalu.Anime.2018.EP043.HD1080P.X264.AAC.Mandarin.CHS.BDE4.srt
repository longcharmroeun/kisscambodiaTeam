Your team is the strongest at this level.

set Tang San as a goal then.

<i>I haven’t been here for a while.

<i>An artisan doesn’t create
excellent tools with excellent iron.</i>

35
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,400
<i>Instead, they use common iron
to create excellent tools.</i>

36
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,590
<i>No matter how common the iron is,</i>

37
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,920

We haven’t seen Little San for a while.

42
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,140
I wonder how he has been recently.

43
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,280
Little San, you’re finally out.

44
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,520
Our iron man is here.

45
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,720
Iron man, why are you so clean today?

46
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,630
I came out because things are done.

47
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,800
Looking at the time,

48
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,120
there are only a few days left before we leave to

49
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,860
Tian Dou Imperial School.

50
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,240
Brother San, what great things
did you make this time?

51
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
Show us, please.

52
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,710
Just some hidden weapons.

53
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,890
But I have made something practical
for everyone.

54
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,190
For us?

55
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,520
Little San, what is this?

56
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,320
Is this a more powerful sleeve arrow?

57
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,130
I call it Flying Godly Claw.

58
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,400
I made it by combining a few types of metals.

59
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,630
Its hardness is enough
to penetrate gold and stone.

60
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,000
This metal claw is its main part.

61
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,160
When the claw is expanded, only with a light touch,

62
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,280
the inner springs and gears will be triggered,

63
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,760
so it’ll contract.

64
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,040
Look.

65
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,510
What other functions does this steel claw have?

66
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,960
If that’s the only function,

67
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,160
my tiger claw would be much better.

68
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,560
Of course not.

69
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,430
After all, it is called Flying Godly Claw.

70
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,280
Look, this is its third function.

71
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,180
The length of the steel cable is 30 meters.

72
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,230
Contractile power is about 150 kgs.

73
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,510
As long as our weight isn’t more than 150 kgs,

74
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,320
we can use it to climb to a certain height.

75
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,430
This is the best tool
for flying from house to house

76
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,010
and for cracking a crib.

77
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,380
You have to beware of your weight.

78
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,200
When you exceed 150 kgs,

79
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,450
this will be useless to you.

80
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,870
Little San, I have no idea what’s in your brain.

81
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,030
You could even figure out such a thing.

82
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,340
Moreover, you created it.

83
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,220
Brother San, you’re really powerful.

<i>I’m able to produce so many tools,</i>

87
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,240
<i>all because of my other Martial Soul.</i>

<i>All metals become soft when they contact with it.</i>

89
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,970
<i>However, it costs too much soul power and energy.</i>

90
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,160
<i>As the Dean, I must be
responsible for every student.</i>

91

<i>Stop looking. Let’s go. We will come back.</i>

92

<i>Worst come to worst, I’ll come here

101
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,420
he shouldn’t torture old people like us.

102

But I had to keep making sausages for all of you.

106
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,320
The soul power I used is no lesser than you.

107
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,150
Stop whining.

108
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,500
I’m the most unfortunate one. I’m heavy

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,940

110
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,790

Okay, no problem. I’ll do that

I heard that some venom can be used medically.

Hold on. Who are you?

177
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,480
You poor fellows?

178
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,790
They’re fierce and cruel. Don’t have mercy.

179
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,590
If anything unexpected happens,

180
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,330
surrender yourselves, and don’t get injured.
Remember that.

181
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,520
Shrek Seven Devils will surely lose.

182
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,650
No, they’ll surely die.
