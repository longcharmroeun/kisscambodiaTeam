Sausages.

You want a sausage? Oscar sausage.

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,200
Two are in Level 29.

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
One is in Level 26, one is in Level 27.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,890
Do you still have comments?

25
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,680
This year, we have students for the fourth exam.

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,250
And four students.

27
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,010
Not much time left.

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,020
You have to come out
with a strategy against him.

29
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,960
Or else, let alone half an hour,

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,640
you wouldn’t even be able
to take his first attack.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 14]

32
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,540
Teacher Zhao’s Martial Soul is Supreme Bear.

33
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,280
It’s a powerful beastly Martial Soul.

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,710
He’s completely flawless.
Its defense is extremely terrifying.

35
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,970
Even the soul masters at his level...

36
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,150
can hardly hurt him.

37
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,300
Flawless.

38
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,360
Speed was Teacher Zhao’s weak point.

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
But there’s a big difference between
your soul power and his,

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,300
so this weak point is worthless to you.

41
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,050
Teacher Zhao has a nickname
in the school, Acala.

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,180
He’s Acala?

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,150
What? You have heard about him?

44
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,970
Many years ago,
Acala offended Martial Soul Hall.

45
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,340
He was surrounded by 16 bishops
of Soul Emperor level.

46
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,030
But they didn’t succeed.

47
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,920
Acala fought against 16 people.

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,310
He survived the surrounding attack.

49
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,440
Since then, he disappeared
in the world of soul master.

50
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,490
Turns out he’s teaching here.
[Shrek School]

51
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,140
So great.

52
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,110
Back then, Teacher Zhao was just a Soul Emperor.

53
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,930
I haven’t seen Teacher Zhao gave his full effort.

54
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,640
So pray for yourself.

55
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,550
Get to know each other...

56
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,170
to see how you can work together.

57
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,230
So you can endure the fight a little longer.

58
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,270
I’m Tang San. My tool soul is Blue Silver Plant.

59
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,960
A soul master of Level 29
from Controlling Branch.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,310
Xiao Wu, my beast soul is Rabbit.

61
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,840
A soul master of Level 29
from Storm Attack Branch.

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,460
Zhu Zhu Qing. My beast soul
is the Cat of Netherworld.

63
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,540
A soul master of Level 27
from Keen Attack Branch.

64
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,410
Ning Rong Rong.
My tool soul is the Qibao Amber Pagoda.

65
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,500
A soul master of Level 26
from Assisting Branch.

66
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,780
You’re from the Qibao Amber Tribe?

67
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,620
Is that the tribe with the most powerful
assisting tool soul of the land,

68
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,510
Qibao Amber Tribe?

69
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,360
Stop staring. I’m no difference from others.

70
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,260
I sneaked out from my home.

71
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,820
Let’s talk after this test.

72
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,540
Two souls rings of mine can increase
our speed and strength.

73
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,040
The increment is about 30%.

74
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,770
It can last for half an hour without problem.

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,900
30%?

76
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,410
That’s great.

77
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,460
I think the combination
of your Martial Souls are good.

78
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,360
Come out with a strategy quickly.

79
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,730
Ning Rong Rong assists the three of us.

80
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,430
Xiao Wu is the main striker.

81
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,820
I’ll control Teacher Zhao’s attack.

82
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,430
Try my best to limit him...

83
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,030
to help Xiao Wu attack.

84
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,070
Zhu Zhu Qing, pin him down from the flanks.

85
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,530
I’ll go there first, then you...

86
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,980
How is it? Are you done discussing?

87
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,330
Teacher. We can start now.

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,960
When the Qibao spins, there will be amber.

89
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,060
Good fellow. Turns out one of the
candidates is from Qibao Amber Tribe.

90
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,010
Not bad.

91
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,550
Frander is going to be excited about it.

92
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,440
<i>If you meet a soul master
from Qibao Amber Tribe,</i>

93
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,810
<i>you must defeat him/her immediately.</i>

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,010
<i>Not good.</i>

95
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,100

Xiao Wu.

98
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,420
Let me show you my power then.

99
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,610
It’s still not strong enough.

100
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,230
Oh, really?

101
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,030
Rise.

102
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,940
<i>What’s going on?
Are they destroying the school?</i>

103
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,960
Delightful. Again.

104
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,230
Little girl, good timing.

105
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,900
Qibao gives the power.

106
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,040
Qibao gives the speed.

107
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,750
Spinning is also fun.

Little San, are we fighting too harshly?

111
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,870
No. Teacher Zhao hasn’t used his soul skill.

112
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,510
The master is defeated by the newbies.

113
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,050
It seems I have to be more serious with you guys.

114
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,340
Mu Bai. What are you laughing at?

115
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,310

Xiao Wu, Human Meteor Hammer.

119
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,080
Blue Silver Plant. Intertwine.

120
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,340
<i>That’s not good.</i>

121
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,800
Xiao Wu.

122
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>That’s not good.</i>

123
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>Great. There’s puzzling soul skill.</i>

124
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,380
<i>Sadly, you forgot that my nickname is...</i>

125
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,370
<i>Teacher Zhao’s nickname is Acala.</i>

126
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,340
<i>Puzzling skill is useless to him.</i>

127
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,460
<i>Besides, if the level difference is too big...</i>

128
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,380
Xiao Wu.

129
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,740
Xiao Wu.

130
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,100
She’s fine.

131
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,750
Puzzling soul skill is good,

132
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,240
but the gap between
her soul power and mine is too great.

133
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,320
She’s attacked by her own soul power.

134
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,930
That’s the natural result.

135
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,240
Just like the poison on your Blue Silver Plant...

136
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,160
is useless against me.

137
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,430
Let her sleep for a night.
She’ll recover tomorrow morning.

138
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,960
I don’t need to fight again, right?

139
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,680
Little girl from Qibao Amber Tribe, you lose.

140
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,190
The gap between us is too big.

141
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,220
You can’t even fight me for half an hour.

142
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,750
Can you please take care of Xiao Wu?

143
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,500
What? You want to carry on?

144
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,450
I’m afraid you may not even
take one attack of mine.

145
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,940
My second soul skill, Supreme Palm,

146
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,080
is not so easy to handle.

147
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,030
I don’t want to continue
the current exam with you.

148
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,820
That means you’ve surrendered?

149
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,140
No.

150
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,500
I hope to fight you seriously.

151
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
We’ll start from the beginning.

If I can withstand more than half an hour,

153
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,270
then please allow the four of us
to join Shrek School.

What if you fail?

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,410
Just now the four of you fought together,

<i>Worst comes to worst, we’ll leave together.</i>

159

<i>As your older brother, I couldn’t protect you.</i>

167
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,810
<i>Unexpectedly, this little boy
made me feel a little uneasy.</i>

168

<i>Tang San’s skill...</i>

<i>Which clan is this attack from?</i>

172
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,010
<i>I haven’t seen this before.</i>

173
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,920
<i>It’s really flawless.</i>

174
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,780
<i>Not right.</i>

175
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,340
<i>Flawless is the flaw.</i>

176
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,780
<i>If the power is focused in front,
once the back is relaxed,</i>

177
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,900
<i>that’s the point where my chance stands.</i>

178
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,500
<i>Good kid.</i>

179
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,110
<i>Turns out Blue Silver Plant can reach such level.</i>

180
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,080
<i>Supreme Palm.</i>

181
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,310
Good monkey, you’re really keen.

182
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,500
This is how you want to buy time.

183
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,550
It won’t be so easy.

184
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,250
Increase gravity.

185
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,050
<i>What a strong soul skill.</i>

186
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,650
<i>What a strong sense of pressure.</i>

187
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,680
<i>My body is sucked to the ground.</i>

188
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,530
Where can you run?

189
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,490
<i>The famous Acala...</i>

190
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,360
<i>can’t even defeat a 12-year-old kid.</i>

191
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,960
Dangerous.

192
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,840
<i>If this is spread, it’ll be the joke
of other teachers.</i>

193
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,970
<i>I’ll surely take this child.</i>

194
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,880
<i>But this exam should end now.</i>

195
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,250
<i>What does this mean?</i>

196
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,350
<i>It’s about to end.</i>

197
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,950
<i>Could this be Teacher Zhao’s...</i>

198
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,580
<i>Little monkey.</i>

199
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,610
This is my fourth soul skill.

200
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,160
[Next Episode]
How’s Xiao Wu?

201
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,100
Come out. I know you’re here.

202
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,140
Who are you?

203
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,290
I meet Acala in such an insignificant place.

204
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,990
I want to fight against with you.

205
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,780
Let’s begin.
