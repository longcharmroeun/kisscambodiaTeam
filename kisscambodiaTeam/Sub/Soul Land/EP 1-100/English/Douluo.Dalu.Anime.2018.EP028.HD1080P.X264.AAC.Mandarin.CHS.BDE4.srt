[Previous Episode]
Ah Yin, here is the place we bade farewell.

21
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,670
Tang Hao, you can’t escape.

22
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,500
Give her to me. I’ll let you live.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,880
If you want to hurt her,

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,590
step over my corpse first.

25
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,520
Farewell, my love.

26
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,680
I’ve given him a name.
[San]

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,730
Little San might not withstand
this Human Faced Demon Spider.

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,860
[Soul Land]
[Episode 28]

29
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,260
Yi Ran, what are you thinking?

30
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,890
I’m thinking of Tang San’s words.

31
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,340
<i>Gift it to you.</i>

32
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,120
Grandma,

33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,590
do you think if I should
use that Bone Piercing Needle?

34
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,150
Use it if you think it’s useful.

35
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,950
Tang San is gifted.

36
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,100
He’s a rare talent.

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,950
Unfortunately, he refused to join our family.

38
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,240
Otherwise, in less than twenty years,

39
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,260
he can definitely lead the family to a new level.

40
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,160
You’ll never find a golden carp in a pond.

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Not only Tang San,

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,550
but also the other children are outstanding.

43
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,460
But, why I’ve never heard of Shrek School?

44
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,200
All these are unimportant.

45
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,740
Although those kids are outstanding as well,

46
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,140
there’s still a difference from Tang San. Yi Ran...

47
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,010
Huh?

48
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,000
How do you think of Tang San?

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,560
Him? I think he’s just a mature kid.

50
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,460
No. I’m asking your feeling towards him.

51
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,800
Grandpa, are you pairing us together?

52
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,540
I’m three years elder than him.

53
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,810
Age is not a matter.

54
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,260
Grandpa, you...

55
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,490
What? Aren’t you willing?

56
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,430
Do you think that he looks too ordinary?

57
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,230
Indeed he has an ordinary look.

58
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,720
Obviously, he isn’t from a famous clan.

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,620
I don’t understand how he practices

60
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,290
the poor martial soul of Blue Silver Plant.

61
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,040
My girl, never judge a book by its cover.

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,470
Tang San is not as common as you say.

63
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,030
How do you know that he isn’t from the famous clan?

64
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,170
Have you ever seen a soul master who
practiced Blue Silver Plant to Level 30?

65
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,770
And the hidden weapon that he used.

66
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,900
All of these are enough to prove
that he’s extraordinary.

67
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,100
Grandpa, don’t be mad.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,090
Let’s talk about it later.

69
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,780
It’s uncertain whether I’ll meet him again.

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,100
Yi Ran, you’d better think properly.
It’s now or never.

71
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,950
No worries, my dear. She’ll have her own happiness.

72
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,940
We’d better help Yi Ran to find
an appropriate third soul ring first.

73
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,790
Let’s figure out the Shrek School

74
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,370
when we return home later.

75
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,440
<i>Brother San, where did you go?</i>

76
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,860
Brother, Xiao Wu is back!

77
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,130
Teacher Zhao, if Little San carries on,

78
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,010
he may be in danger.

79
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,760
I knew it. But it’s
inappropriate to disturb him now.

80
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,880
Everything depends on his willpower.

81
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,530
Who?

82
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,200
Xiao Wu, you’re still alive!

83
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,040
Are you expecting me to die?

84
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,560
What happened? This mist...

85
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,480
What happened to Little San?

86
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,600
Xiao Wu, please wait.

87
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,050
Little San is absorbing his third soul ring.

88
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,270
Don’t disrupt him.

89
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,820
Third soul ring? How come...?

90
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,350
How can this happen during
absorbing the third soul ring?

91
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,780
This is Human Faced Demon Spider.

92
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,680
The soul ring of Human Faced
Demon Spider that Little San is absorbing

93
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,770
far exceeds the limit of his third soul ring.

94
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,180
How do you know it?

95
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,620
Grandmaster did say

96
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,410
the limit of a third soul ring
is about 1,700 years.

97
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,100
The legs of this Human Faced
Demon Spider is longer than 3 meters.

98
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,750
It had undergone at least 2,000 years of practice.

99
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,210
I see.

100
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,270
But it’s too late to stop him now!

101
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,770
Hopefully Little San can withstand until the end.

102
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,050
By the way, how did you
escape from the Titan Giant Ape?

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,420
I don’t know what happened either.

104
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,630
The Titan Giant Ape caught me
and ran into the forest.

105
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,720
Before running further,
we heard a cow roaring from far.

106
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,510
The Titan Giant Ape looked nervous.

107
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,930
It threw me aside and ran away.

108
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,080
Cow roar? What kind of cow can
make Titan Giant Ape nervous?

109
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,940
Titan Giant Ape roared before leaving,

110
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,540
so I fainted.

111
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,240
It had disappeared when I awoke.

112
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,910
By the time,

113
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,790
my soul power was upgraded to Level 30.

114
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,230
What? You’re reaching Level 30 now!

115
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,400
Who’s elder between Tang San and you?

116
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,940
I’m a few months younger.

117
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,950
At the time, a few Millennium Soul Beasts fainted as well.

118
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,890
Coincidentally, there’s one suit for me!

119
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,210
So I hunted it. It’s such a coincidence!

120
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,590
Ah! How can it be?

121
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,110
I thought I would be dead.
Unexpectedly, I survived.

122
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,320
I was physically recovered
after absorbing the soul ring.

123
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
So I came to you all at once.

124
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,540
<i>Xiao Wu, I’ll definitely rescue you!</i>

125
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,290
<i>Brother, please stay well!</i>

126
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,170
<i>It’s all my fault. My bad.</i>

127
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,120
<i>Please wake up.</i>

128
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,300
Don’t you worry, Little San can overcome it.

129
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,050
[Soul Land]

130
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,260
Have you been returned home?

131
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,520
Do you think I still have a home?

132
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,530
You have to return one day
since they are your family.

133
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,660
It’ll not be now even if I return.

134
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,390
Before I prove myself,

135
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,590
I won’t make myself a joke to them.

136
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,780
Xiao Gang, you’re too stubborn.

137
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,340
Otherwise, you and she would not be...

138
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,030
Shut up! Don’t mention her in front of me!

139
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,690
I’m here just for one purpose.

140
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,930
All right. Not mentioning her.

141
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,390
Isn’t Tang San your purpose to be here?

142
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,600
Zhao Wu Ji was beaten
a few days ago because of Tang San.

143
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,880
I can guess who is the person.

144
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
You know?

145
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,470
Do you think Little San’s Martial Soul
is only Blue Silver Plant?

146
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,710
He made it.

147
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,250
He has overcome the danger.

148
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,020
He’s undergoing the transformation
process of soul power now.

149
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,180
Tang San is a miracle!

150
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,120
He can even withstand the
Human Faced Demon Spider of 2,000 years.

151
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,590
The Unrivaled Dragon Serpent
should be grateful that

152
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,140
their granddaughter didn’t
absorb this soul ring.

153
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,100
If not, she might have already
died of body explosion.

154
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,250
Let’s step back.
Little San’s power has just upgraded.

155
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,680
His soul power is out of control now.

156
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,580
Teacher.

157
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,970
This is very common. Don’t worry.

158
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,390
Brother.

159
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,050
This shouldn’t happen.

160
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,030
Brother.

161
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,960
This...

162
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,780
Isn’t this the leg of Human Faced Demon Spider?

163
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,870
It’s my first time to see this condition.

164
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,820
Look!

165
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,200
Teacher Zhao, what happened to Little San?

166
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,340
This...

167
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,840
Is Little San becoming a big spider?

168
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,830
It’s impossible! How can Little San become a spider?

169
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,800
The mutation must have occurred
when he absorbed the soul ring.

170
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,680
He’ll be all right.

171
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,390
Teacher Zhao, what should we do now?

172
00:14:53,390 --> 00:15:00,100
Now? Perhaps we can only wait.

173
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,240
<i>Xiao Wu, don’t. Please don’t leave me.</i>

174
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,700
<i>Xiao Wu, don’t. Please don’t leave me.</i>

175
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,010
<i>An outer disciple is not allowed
to enter the inner clan for a whole life.</i>

176
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,930
<i>Scriptures of Tang Clan are never be propagated.</i>

177
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,390
An outer is always an outer.
You can only be trash.

178
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,410
How dare an outer disciple
peep at the inner practice!

179
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,660
Give him a lesson!

180
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,150
Tang San has already mastered the outer skill.

181
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,320
I know well that
the journey of learning is infinite.

182
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,430
I beg Elder to teach me the inter martial art

183
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,000
and allow me to enter the Scriptures Library.

184
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,160
Scriptures Library is an
important place of Tang Clan.

185
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,670
The inner disciples never dare to think of that.

186
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,780
You’d know your place.

187
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,370
Tang San would like to learn
deeper of the hidden weapon.

188
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,240
I’ll develop the hidden weapon.

189
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,980
If you still have improper thoughts,

190
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,930
I will definitely report to
Grandmaster Tang Lan

191
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,880
to expel you from the clan.

192
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,800
[Next Episode]

193
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,090
If you insist to enter,

194
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,700
you will be chased out from Tang Clan.

195
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,970
Death is the only option.

196
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,780
Rebellious! Never let go of him!

197
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,950
Brother, keep it up!

198
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,910
I am not dreaming, right?

199
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,580
Xuan Tian Records?

200
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,010
Tang San, you may try it boldly.

201
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,960
Who?
