00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,200
<i>I haven’t been here for a while.
Everything is rusted.</i>

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,210
<i>An artisan doesn’t create
excellent tools with excellent iron.</i>

23
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,540
<i>Instead, they use common iron
to create excellent tools.</i>

24
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,260
Brother San, what great things
did you make this time?

25
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,990
I call it Flying Godly Claw.

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,550
As the Dean,
I must be responsible for every student.

27
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,660
Actually, it’s good to be tired.

28
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,710
So that I have an excuse for you
to massage my legs.

29
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,920
You haven’t fought for two months.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,880
Tonight, you shall exercise
in the Silves Soul Arena.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 44]

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,640
Ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,320
Coming right up, our 9th group battle today.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,990
It’s also the most eye-catching battle
of this month.

35
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,650
Xiu Ren versus Luo Ji.

36
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,370
Why?

37
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,560
Sorry, fellow respected soul masters.

38
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,160
We don’t have a Gold Soul Battle Team
at Level 30 here.

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,760
I’m afraid you can’t join the group battle tonight.

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,320
Silver Soul Battle Team can also do.

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,260
Didn’t you see that

42
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,960
only one of them achieved
the gold soul level?

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,380
The battle you mentioned is obviously unfair.

44
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,980
I’m sure you understand.

45
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,960
Someone’s plan is going out of the window.

46
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,830
Is there no other way?

47
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,770
If you challenge those higher ranks,
the level of soul badge wouldn’t matter.

48
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,680
That means

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,400
you may choose to challenge
any soul battle team at Level 40.

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,350
Level 40?

51
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,270
Forget about it then.

52
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,750
No, I think that’s okay.

53
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,510
Are you kidding?

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,860
You want them to challenge
a soul battle team at Level 40?

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,600
Are you sending them to death?

56
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,140
You said we may choose any opponent we like.

57
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,150
Right?

58
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,920
Is there a team at Level 40,
which is especially cruel?

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,240
Those who injure or kill
their opponents will be the best.

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,330
The more formidable, the better.

61
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,550
What?

62
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,840
Xiao Gang, are you insane?

63
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,210
Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.

64
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,270
Is there such a team?

65
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,840
Yes, the Fiend Battle Team.

66
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,740
It’s the lethal weapon
among soul battle teams at Level 40.

67
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,180
After they achieved the silver soul level,

68
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,480
they won 31 fights out of 46.

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,130
They’ve killed 63 opponents,

70
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,190
injured 98 opponents.

71
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,490
Okay. We shall challenge this Fiend Battle Team.

72
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,240
Grandmaster.

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,760
But, is this good?

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,420
Frander, this is an experience to toughen them.

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,490
They’ll meet such situation one day.

76
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,930
When they face it today,

77
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,880
at least we’re here to guide them.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,760
It’s better than having them
endure it alone in the future.

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,790
Alright. I hope you’re right.

80
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,440
Fellow respected soul masters,
this way, please.

81
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,820
Get some rest and be ready.
We’ll have a look around.

82
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,080
It’s especially happening today.
Who are they betting on?

83
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,480
They’re betting on Fiend Battle Team.

84
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
What? It’s them?

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,160
They’re insane, cruel and wicked.

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,460
Aren’t they boycotted by all
silver soul battle teams at Level 40?

87
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,400
This time, a team is challenging them.

88
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,340
They’re called Shrek Seven Devils.

89
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,930
I haven’t heard about them before.
They aren’t famous.

90
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,770
They dare to challenge Fiend Battle Team.

91
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,120
Shrek Seven Devils is a
Gold Soul Battle Team at Level 30.

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
Although they have reached the gold soul level,

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,640
according to what I found out,

94
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,650
there’s only one of them who has a gold soul badge.

95
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,770
And some of them haven’t reached
Level 30 in the team.

96
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,900
They’re challenging a higher rank.

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,270
But the gap is...

98
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,300
Shrek Seven Devils will surely lose.

99
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,310
No, they’ll surely die.
Shrek Seven Devils will surely lose.

100
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,300
No, they’ll surely die.

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,600
That’s right.

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,290
The captain, Meng Li, upholds that
the brutal are afraid of the fierce,

103
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,000
the fierce are afraid of the desperate.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,870
He instilled his motto to his entire team.

105
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,920
How many soul masters at Level 40

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,160
lost their lives to their insane attack?

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,880
Even if they lose,

108
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,080
they’ll let their opponents become
disabled or even dead.

109
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,970
Those who want to bet on Fiend Battle Team,

110
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,320
get in line,

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,160
lest you can’t make it before the soul battle.

112
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,760
I’ll bet 30,000 gold soul coins
on Shrek Seven Devils.

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,520
What? How much?

114
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,720
I’ll bet 30,000 gold soul coins
on Shrek Seven Devils.

115
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,130
Is it not allowed?

116
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,110
Are you sure?

117
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,060
I’m sure. Just swipe the card.

118
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,620
I’ll bet 10,000 gold soul coins
on Shrek Seven Devils.

119
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,960
Things are especially odd recently.

120
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,320
The result is obvious.

121
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,830
Yet more than one simpletons
gifted us their money.

122
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,230
Brother, did you see it correctly?

123
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,720
Shrek Seven Devils and Fiend Battle Team
have such a huge gap

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,960
between their soul power and soul rings.
Yet you’re still betting on them?

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,540
You don’t know this.

126
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,010
I’m a businessman.

127
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,680
I have businesses in Barak Kingdom
and Silves Kingdom.

128
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,590
Not long ago, in Suo Tuo City of Barak Kingdom,

129
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,960
I saw an extremely splendid group soul battle.

130
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,280
The winner was Shrek Seven Devils.

131
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,600
Don’t look down upon them
because their levels are low

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,150
and soul rings are few.

133
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,990
Brother, if you believe me, bet it as I do.

134
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,590
You’ll surely gain profit.

135
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,860
I see. I believe you.

136
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,720
<i>I didn’t expect to meet their fan</i>

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,410
<i>in the capital of Silves Kingdom.</i>

138
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,250
<i>But he’s supporting them blindly.</i>

139
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,380
<i>If there’s no special reason,</i>

140
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,230
<i>even if little monsters have
outstanding Martial Souls,</i>

141
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,840
<i>they can’t defeat an opponent
that is much more powerful than them.</i>

142
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,400
The reason I made this decision

143
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,560
is to help Frander,

144
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,360
and to let you test your weapon.

145
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,250
In this group soul battle,

146
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,070
I permit you to use the hidden weapons
that Tang San made.

147
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,000
But, Master, this is...

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,650
The team I chose is very cruel and fierce.

149
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,120
They have plenty of debts of blood.

150
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,750
You don’t have to feel bad in the fight.

151
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,810
The opponents are stronger than you.

152
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,600
Remember, if you want to defeat them,

153
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
you have to take them by surprise.

154
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,150
Keep being on their heels.
Don’t give them a chance to breathe.

155
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,890
Little San, do you understand?

156
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,440
Master, I understand.

157
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,760
Alright. You shall arrange the fighting tactic.

158
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,420
[Soul Land]

159
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,640
<i>They’re cruel and fierce.
Don’t have mercy on them.</i>

160
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,160
<i>Settle it as fast as possible, get it?</i>

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,790
<i>If anything unexpected happens,
jump off the stage immediately,</i>

162
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,340
<i>surrender yourselves, and don’t get injured.
Remember that.</i>

163
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,240
Fiend Battle Team is marching in now.

164
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Silver Soul Battle Team at Level 40.

165
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,680
The team who’s challenging them
is Shrek Seven Devils.

166
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,450
Gold Soul Battle Team at Level 30.

167
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,730
Both sides release their Martial Souls.

168
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,330
Boss Dai, if they charge forward,

169
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,740
with Rong Rong’s help,

170
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,610
can you hold on?

171
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,360
No.

172
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,130
Curse you.

173
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,800
How can you be lack of confidence
in Little San’s precious tools?

174
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,640
I’m not. I mean just in case.

175
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
To think I’m a youth with

176
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,080
bright future, good look, elegance...

177
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,840
Xiao Gang.

178
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,040
Won’t these soul masters with soul skills
at Level 40 resist Little San’s hidden weapons?

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
They’re all from Storm Attack Branch.

180
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
Their defence capability
is second to the Defence Branch.

181
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,370
They can resist it.

182
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,810
What did you say?

183
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,840
I’ve studied the attacking power
of Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

184
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,910
Generally,

185
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,690
the first two soul skills of
Storm Attack Branch can’t resist it.

186
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,390
But when they initiate their third soul skill,

187
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,290
they can basically fight it.

188
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,600
If it’s the fourth soul skill,
there will be no problem at all.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,820
Then why did you send them
to the soul battle?

190
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,710
Do you want them to die?

191
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,620
So what if the third and
fourth soul skill can resist it?

192
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,230
It doesn’t affect Tang San
and his teammates to win,

193
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,730
Tang San once told me,

194
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,530
the key to the hidden weapon is being secretive.

195
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,750
If it were you,

196
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,390
when you’re facing an opponent,
who’s far worse than you,

197
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:23,290
will you consume your energy of third
or even fourth soul skill at the start?

198
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,920
Of course,

199
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,440
such a surprise attack mode can’t be repeated.

200
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,210
But Tang San’s hidden weapon is being
used for the first time at the arena.

201
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,060
When the opponents are
using first and second soul skills,

202
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,380
they can’t resist it.

203
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,790
Be ready.

204
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,270
Tear them apart.

205
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,330
Look at how the girl is shivering.

206
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,640
Look at them.

207
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,980
Shrek Seven Devils challenges
Fiend Battle Team.

208
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,170
Begin.

209
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,920
Release.

210
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,540
I’m going to check Zhu Qing.

211
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,020
Can you announce the result
of this soul battle now?

212
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,840
Group soul battle,

213
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,640
Shrek Seven Devils versus Fiend Battle Team.

214
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,990
Fiend Battle Team lost.

215
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,150
Shrek Seven Devils successfully
challenged them.

216
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,470
I’ve figured it out. 90% of the money

217
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,320
shall be used to help the families
of the victims of Fiend Battle Team.

218
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,350
The rest shall be used
as the backup money of our school.

219
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,120
What do you think?

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,190
Little San, just now we...

221
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,720
Master said they’re a group of ruffians.

222
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,900
But, we...

223
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,560
Are we wrong?

224
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,370
As a soul master,

225
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,010
this is a problem that you’ll face sooner or later.

226
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,340
Those in front of you

227
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,770
are the obstacles that you must overcome.

228
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,070
To face it now is better than

229
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,860
on the battlefield in the future.

230
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,250
Or else, the one who falls can be you.

231
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,060
Any strong soul masters

232
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,980
have to go through this.

233
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,540
You have to pay a price for any victory in a battle.

234
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,040
Battles of soul masters are not games.

235
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,680
Fiend Battle Team used soul battle as an excuse

236
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,120
to do violent and illegal things.

237
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,680
Alone in silver soul level battles,
they have killed 64 people,

238
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,150
injured 98 people.

239
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,800
They weren’t punished for the crime,

240
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,090
instead, they earned their income.

241
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,280
They even got the attention and
invitation of some stronger force.

242
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,990
Fiend Battle Team is heavily injured
by hidden weapons.

243
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,600
Although they’re alive,

244
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,910
they have lost their power to fight.

245
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,370
They can’t do any crime anymore.

246
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,800
This is a good thing to fellow soul masters.

247
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,240
If you don’t want to be
the centre of attraction,

248
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,570
you’d better hide your masks

249
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,960
and leave with us right away.

250
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,190
Xiao Gang, is it your plan
to punish the Fiend Battle Team?

251
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,970
So you chose this notorious team
as their opponent?

252
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,620
Yes, indeed.

253
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,020
This is another test for the kids.

254
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,110
Or better said, a training.

255
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,510
At least, if such a thing happens in the future,

256
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,400
they’ll be mentally prepared.

257
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,730
However, they’re still young.

258
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,840
Isn’t this too much for them?

259
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,720
These kids are smart.

260
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,730
They won’t get themselves into a dead end.

261
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,430
I’ve played the role of a bad man.

262
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,050
Then Frander played the role
of a good man to comfort them.

263
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,130
They won’t feel so bad anymore.

264
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,560
I always have a positive image in their hearts.

265
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,650
Of course, I’m the good man.

266
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,400
Wu Ji, don’t worry.

267
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,190
I vomited a lot at my first time too.

268
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,000
This is a stage of life.

269
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,440
It’s okay they went through that earlier.

270
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:26,910
One sheep, two sheep, three sheep, five sheep...

271
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,890
One dumpling, two dumpings,

272
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,840
three dumplings, four dumplings...

273
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,150
Little monsters, today is a new start.

274
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,610
Our destination is
Tian Dou Imperial School. Let’s go.

275
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
[Next Episode]
Here we are.

276
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,170
This is the board of education
of Tian Dou Imperial School.

277
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,070
Get lost.

278
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,820
Tian Dou Imperial School is not a refugee camp.

279
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,010
I heard from Qin Ming,

280
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,130
these kids defeated Emperor Team
from our school.

281
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,220
There’s an excellent soul master
of Controlling Branch.

282
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,080
Who could that be?

283
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,040
That’s enough.
