Little San...

24
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,560
What did happen just now?

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,940
Tell me in detail.

26
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,340
The ultimate practice of
Heart Separation Control

27
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,760
is to grasp every change
of the surroundings.

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
Preliminary second round, first match.

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,620
Shrek School won.

30
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,060
All of you are well-known now.

31
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,680
Yet, being your dean,
this will never be enough for me.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,220
The first six rounds of Preliminary are over.

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,040
Why there are no more decent opponents?

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,320
Since you’re keen to battle,

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,300
I’ll find an opportunity for you in the future.

36
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,860
Let’s go and watch the battle.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 74]

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,900
Cang Hui School.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,200
I’m looking forward to fighting them.

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,460
They can’t even take down
Elephant Armored School in the first match.

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,340
How dare they act so arrogantly.

42
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,280
They’re not the opponents that
you all should concern about.

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,420
For the Preliminary,

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,320
your biggest rivals are those Five Elements Schools.

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,960
Five Elements Schools?

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,020
Shen Feng, Chi Huo, Tian Shui, Lei Ting

47
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,620
and also Elephant Armored School
from the earth element.

48
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,780
They’re collectively known as five great
elemental schools in Tian Dou Empire.

49
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,380
From their names, you’ll know

50
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,080
the team members use martial souls
of corresponding elements to battle.

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,300
These five great schools have deep backgrounds.

52
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,840
Thus, they might have hidden abilities.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,740
Huyan Li’s soul bone is the best example.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,520
Grandmaster, is Lei Ting School supported by
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon’s family?

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
Yes.

56
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,360
I don’t know much of the backgrounds
of Shen Feng, Tian Shui and Chi Huo.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,040
But, I can sense that
they are difficult to deal with.

58
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,400
Shen Feng and Tian Shui Schools
will have battles today.

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Master, why do these five schools

60
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
have soul masters of
the same element in a team?

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Even though this can boost particular aspects,

62
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,160
the weaknesses also become obvious.

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,760
Like Elephant Armored School,

64
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,960
it has strong defense and strength,

65
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,520
but it has low agility and
monotonous attack formula.

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,460
It also lacks abilities to assist and control.

67
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,460
This is a struggle between balanced and
extreme factions in the soul master’s world.

68
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,660
The extreme faction believes that

69
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,600
a soul master should develop his abilities

70
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
in a single direction

71
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,840
to an extreme.

72
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,380
However, the balanced faction believes that

73
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,560
a soul master should develop his abilities

74
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,620
in balance between attack and defense.

75
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,240
It’s different from the balanced nature
of Xing Luo Empire.

76
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,980
Most soul masters of Tian Dou Empire

77
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,600
are the supporters of the extreme faction,

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,440
just like the Li Tribe from Tai Long’s family.

79
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Then, how about Martial Soul Hall?

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,300
Martial Soul Hall should be

81
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,840
the fusion of both streams.

82
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,480
It is the fused stream of extreme individuals

83
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,820
and balanced teams.

84
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
After many years of investigation,
I found that

85
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,080
this is the most suitable method to cultivate.

86
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,000
It’s right.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,860
The individual strength is preferred
to go to an extreme.

88
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,060
Weakness can be complemented by teammates.

89
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,940
The teams of Martial Soul Hall
did the same in every batch.

90
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,500
The champions of previous batches
were also taken by them.

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,060
With the authority of Martial Soul Hall,

92
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,540
they can encourage the fusion of both streams

93
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,060
to make everyone advanced,

94
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,320
but why did they hide it confidentially?

95
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,640
The story behind is very complicated.

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,560
You’re still young.
It’s unnecessary to go deep on that.

97
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,900
What you must do now is

98
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,440
to improve your strength as possible as you can.

99
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,660
If you wish to obtain the champion,

100
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,580
your only opponent will be
the team of Martial Soul Hall.

101
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,620
Their strength is

102
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,760
certainly far beyond Emperor Team
and the five great elemental schools.

103
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,520
Martial Soul Hall is much
stronger than what you expect.

104
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,260
Martial Soul Hall.

105
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,640
Master, I’d like to go back to school first.

106
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,340
My Heart Separation Control is not skillful yet.

107
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,800
I have to practice it more.

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,860
You’re right.

109
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,240
It’ll be better to strengthen myself,
rather than investigating others.

110
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,700
All right then.
Be careful on your way back.

111
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,880
<i>603, 604, 605...</i>

112
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,780
<i>There’s something amiss.</i>

113
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,320
<i>I’ve taken 605 steps since I started
to walk from stopping just now.</i>

114
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,800
<i>Why am I still far from the school?</i>

115
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Please show yourself.

116
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,840
Worthy of being the most
outstanding disciple of Shrek School,

117
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,260
you’re vigilant.

118
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,660
Unfortunately, it’s too late.

119
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,220
Oh, you’re a teacher from Cang Hui School.

120
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,260
Are you stopping me for some advice?

121
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,800
I have no advice. I just need you to disappear.

122
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,320
Do you think that my absence

123
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,140
can make Cang Hui School defeat Shrek School?

124
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,940
If killing one doesn’t work,
I’ll keep killing more of you.

125
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,480
I’ll target Dai Mu Bai as the next.

126
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,700
Are you going to kill me here? Not afraid...

127
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,560
You thought we’re still in Tian Dou City?

128
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:04,780
[Soul Land]

129
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,480
Your weapon is pretty good.

130
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,220
Unfortunately, you’re not in reality now.

131
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,480
This is

132
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,260
my Brutal Dreamland.

133
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,120
The greatest pleasure in my lifetime

134
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,180
is watching my opponents
become insane in my Brutal Dreamland,

135
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,000
until they die.

136
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,180
Soon, I’ll see a youth who is known
as a genius to become like this.

137
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,620
I’m already excited.

138
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
Defense?

139
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,080
Do you think that you can resist
my seventh soul skill of Nightmare?

140
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,920
Tang San, such a monstrous sin of you
stealing the Xuan Tian Records!

141
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,720
Tang Clan raised you and taught
you the skills. But, you are ungrateful!

142
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,140
Elders, please listen to me.

143
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,440
How sinful you are!

144
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,140
You will have the clan’s most severe punishment.

145
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,800
You will be held here
for seven days and nights,

146
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,400
and be killed by
the eagles and falcons on the cliff.

147
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,400
Xiao Wu.

148
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,940
Brother, rescue me.

149
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,740
No. Don’t...

150
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,380
No.

151
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,420
This reddish light...

152
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,000
The bloody disaster?

153
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Where did my brother go?

154
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Little San went back to practice first.

155
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,180
There must be something happened to brother.

156
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,140
What’s going on to Xiao Wu?

157
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,440
Grandmaster said Brother San
went back to school, right?

158
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,520
Nothing could happen in
Tian Dou City during the day.

159
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,520
Anyway, let’s check it out with her.

160
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,540
You’re a genius, so what?

161
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,800
You will die in pain in my Brutal Dreamland.

162
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,180
Unfortunately,

163
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,860
I haven’t reached the level of
a Grand Soul Land Master,

164
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,400
otherwise, I can see what he
experienced in the martial soul.

165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,420
It will more perfect then.

166
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,000
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

167
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,560
No. It’s impossible.

168
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,200
You just reached Level 40.

169
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,680
There’s nothing impossible. You’ve lost.

170
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,500
Have I lost?

171
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,580
Brat, you’re still young to aim high.

172
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,320
You’re impossible to conquer

173
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,520
my soul power at Level 72.

174
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,040
Even if you can conquer
my seventh soul skill of Nightmare,

175
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
the ending will never change as well.

176
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
However, I’ll give you a chance

177
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,000
to tell me how you broke the Nightmare.

178
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,320
At least, I can make you die in less pain.

179
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,060
Before die, I’ll let you know it clearly.

180
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,040
My Purple Demon Eye
has reached the Surreal level.

181
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,440
It obstructs any kind of illusions.

182
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,340
Even it’s the 9th soul skill,

183
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,540
yet it couldn’t hide from my sight.

184
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,960
Starting from the street illusion that you set,

185
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,360
I had used my Purple Demon Eye to observe.

186
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,960
I just kept pretending not to reveal it.

187
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,920
Why didn’t you break the Nightmare
when you launched the weapon in hands?

188
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,000
You’ve missed the golden chance to escape.

189
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,140
Although it’s tough...

190
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,080
I didn’t want to escape. I was just waiting for it.

191
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,240
Waiting?

192
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,400
There’s a huge gap between you and me.

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,220
Though I’ve discovered you earlier,

194
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,220
yet I can’t attack you directly.

195
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,420
Hence, I just kept waiting

196
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,360
until the moment you believed
that I had been controlled.

197
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,620
So that you aren’t in vigilant anymore.

198
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,740
Hilarious. A tiny ant couldn’t fight
against an elephant.

199
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,599
But I’ve made it.

200
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,739
You thought that Blue Silver Plant
was protecting myself?

201
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,119
Your sight is hindered, aren’t you?

202
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,299
You missed my action.

203
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,119
The Yama’s Invitation that I launched
by coagulating soul power

204
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,399
has undissolvable poisons.
It also spreads instantly.

205
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,580
You feel a slight tingle
as it enters your body without pain.

206
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,100
In just a few words, you will die.

207
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,500
You...

208
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,860
[Next Episode] Don’t tell anyone
about Shi Nian’s incident.

209
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,280
including Shrek Seven Devils.

210
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,920
What’s the thing that keeps shining?

211
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,300
Grandmaster.

212
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,840
Is Shrek School’s opponent
for this round confirmed?

213
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,480
Their abilities may be higher than
Elephant Armoured School.

214
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,380
If you can’t do this, you’d better give up.

215
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,480
since this is just a Preliminary.

216
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,580
Grandmaster, please let Little San join the battle.

217
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,320
Little San is the soul of Shrek Team.

218
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,380
We can’t proceed without him.

219
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,420
It’s now!

220
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,000
It comes to an end.
