[Previous Episode]

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,540
Remember. Only by combining all your strength,

22
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,570
you can minimize the capability difference.

23
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,240
As the captain of Emperor Team,
you’re indeed calm, reliable and strong.

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,900
I’ll kill you all!

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,470
However, in your heart, while facing a weak team,

26
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,140
- you’re a little reckless.
- How could you neutralize my Venom?

27
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,770
Venom is the unique skill of Tang Clan.

28
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,470
You’re careless.

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,670
- Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom lost its function,
- No.

30
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,600
but it has gained the most crucial time.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Xiao Wu!

[Soul Land]
[Episode 41]

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,590
How dare you injure Xiao Wu?

34
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,550
Third soul skill.

35
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,870
Raging Storm.

36
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,500
Zhu Qing, White Tiger of Netherworld.

37
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,690
It’s Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

38
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
No way, it’s Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,700
<i>You know what, among martial souls,</i>

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,750
<i>it’s difficult to meet a martial soul
that complements each other.</i>

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,430
<i>But if they meet and collaborate,</i>

42
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,350
<i>the strength of one’s martial soul
will be doubled.</i>

43
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,590
<i>This is the so-called Martial Soul Fusion Skill.</i>

44
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,100
Don’t let them do it.

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,980
Third soul skill.

46
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,710
Fury of Thunderbolt.

47
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,610
Third soul skill.

48
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,570
Leopard Shadow Doppelganger.

49
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,050
Boss Dai.

50
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,430
Little Sister?

51
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,130
Mutated Martial Soul.

52
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,290
Shimo, Shi Mo. Be careful!

53
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,350
Second soul skill.

54
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,420
Shield Form.

55
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,830
Down.

56
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,270
What a deceiving stroke!

57
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,230
Yu Feng!

58
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,730
You just used the third soul skill.

59
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,090
It has depleted your soul power.

60
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,630
No more energy left to perform
those strange moves.

61
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,070
You’ve no way to hide.

62
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,490
Captain!

63
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,570
Let go of her.

64
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,270
We’ve lost.

65
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,290
Cure my teammate.

66
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,100
<i>Little San, your soul bone of Eight Spiders is poisonous.</i>

67
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
<i>Don’t hurt others.</i>

68
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,230
<i>The poison is about to reach the heart.</i>

69
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,850
<i>Luckily, it’s detoxified in time. Otherwise...</i>

70
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,260
Save my teammate.

71
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,570
Or else, they will die.

72
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,000
Should we announce the result
of this soul battle?

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,290
The battle is over. Shrek Seven Devils won.

74
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,540
Little San, it seems like you would become Asura

75
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,410
only when Xiao Wu is in danger,

76
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,500
Your team is robust.

77
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,010
But, we didn’t lose to you completely.

78
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,970
You’re right, it’s because
your cooperation is flawed.

79
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,750
Otherwise, it would still anyone’s guess.

80
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,090
We’ll be flawless for the next battle.

81
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,330
The victory will still belong to us,
Shrek Seven Devils.

82
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,050
It’s impressive your toxin can break my venom.

83
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,460
I’ll keep this shame in my heart.

84
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,410
You’ll be defeated by my venom one day.

85
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,010
I’ll look forward to it.

86
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,650
We’ve won!

87
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,840
[Soul Land]

88
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,420
Sorry, Teacher. We’ve lost.

89
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,930
It was my fault for today’s failure.

90
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,030
I was overzealous and fell into their trap.

91
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,500
Please punish me.

92
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,190
No, Captain. It was not your fault.

93
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,970
We never expected they were so cunning.

94
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,140
No, Osler. Being cunning is also part of strength.

95
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,710
We’ve lost the battle. Don’t find any excuses.

96
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,710
Tian Heng, it’s not your fault, but mine.

97
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,620
As the soul master of
Controlling Branch, our team’s soul,

98
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,310
I didn’t lead everyone well enough.

99
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,670
Captain...

100
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,030
It’s a failure to all of you,

101
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,070
but it isn’t bad at all.

102
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,180
Why?

103
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,370
You all have been through
very smoothly so far.

104
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,020
This failure came just in time.

105
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
It makes you learn from failure.

106
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,020
You all must learn to progress from failure.

107
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,180
Progress from failure?

108
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,100
You may go back to rest. I have an appointment.

109
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,380
Great, you’ve won.

110
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,060
You’ve defeated your rivals and yourselves.

111
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,930
Today’s group battle

112
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,270
is counted as a test of the second phase training.

113
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,220
You all have passed.

114
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,850
Grandmaster, would you give us a break

115
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,740
after going back?

116
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,120
Don’t be too proud, young fellows.

117
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,310
You can’t compete with Emperor Battle Team,

118
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,630
when it comes to the fight of strength.

119
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,090
But Dean, you’ve taught us that

120
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,930
luck is also part of our strength.

121
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,900
Little brat, don’t get smart with me.

122
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,950
Enough, Frander. Stop it.

123
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,290
They have been working so hard this time.

124
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,510
Grandmaster, are you going

125
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,660
to give them a break after going back?

126
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,140
They do need to rest.

127
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,250
After this trip, you can have a break for 15 days.

128
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,940
I’ll think about the third-phase training.

129
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,740
What? The third-phase?

130
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,620
Why? Do you have any problems?

131
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,230
No, absolutely no.

132
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,710
You’re the wisest.

133
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,300
Besides having the third-phase training,

134
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,620
we’re welcoming the forth, the fifth to come.

135
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,300
Dean Frander, Deputy Dean Zhao, how are you?

136
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,870
You’re the leader of Emperor Battle Team?

137
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,250
Qin Ming here greets my teachers.

138
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,850
I thought you little brat had forgotten us.

139
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,060
Little brat, you’ve improved a lot.

140
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,330
It seems like you’ll catch up with us very soon.

141
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,290
Regardless of the time,

142
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,500
you are always my teachers.

143
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,060
I’m always the disciple of Shrek School.

144
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,420
Disciple of Shrek School?

145
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,150
You’re still as polite as before.

146
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,350
Come, I’ll give you introductions.

147
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,350
This’s Grandmaster.

148
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,500
He’s the teacher of Shrek School.

149
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,650
Greetings to Grandmaster.

150
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,580
Not necessary.

151
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,580
You’re his nephew’s teacher.

152
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,430
You both are considered peers.

153
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,530
That’s why he didn’t accept your courtesy.

154
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,340
Nephew’s teacher?

155
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,270
Why are you still hiding it?

156
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,390
Do you want me to tell them that

157
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,390
Yu Tian Heng is your nephew?

158
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,910
What?

159
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,700
Frander, I told you repeatedly

160
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,180
I have no relation with
Blue Lightning Tyrant Tribe anymore.

161
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,150
I have said too much.

162
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,710
I didn’t expect that he still minds it.

163
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,930
You must be curious about

164
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,670
why Qin Ming is here?

165
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,410
It’s simple. He was once a student

166
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,250
of Shrek School like you all.

167
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,140
Moreover, he was once an outstanding student.

168
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,540
Hello, juniors.

169
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,370
Nice to meet you, senior.

170
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,660
Dean, it seems like Shrek School
has developed better than it was.

171
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,400
What progress is better?

172
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,620
They’re the last batch.

173
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,380
Haven’t the financial problems been resolved?

174
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,970
That’s the reality. We’re getting old.

175
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,750
We’ve lost the impetus we used to have.

176
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,830
After their graduation,

177
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,780
we’re going to live our own life.

178
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,950
Shrek Seven Devils are

179
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,690
younger and better than the students
of Tian Dou Imperial School.

180
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,020
You may go to settle your credits.

181
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,830
Brother San, thank you.

182
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,410
What are you thanking him for?

183
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,750
I know I’m not smart enough,

184
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,140
but I’m definitely not a fool.

185
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,110
During the battle, when Little San faced
the shield attack,

186
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,390
he didn’t use Oscar’s
Flying Mushroom Sausage to dodge it.

187
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,730
It’s because Oscar, Rong Rong, and I
were behind him.

188
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,160
Didn’t you say that we are a team?

189
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,910
I can’t betray my teammates, right?

190
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,130
By the way, what kind of school is

191
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,060
Tian Dou Imperial School
mentioned by Qin Ming?

192
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,510
Little San, are you kidding?

193
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,510
You know nothing about Tian Dou Imperial School?

194
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,530
I really don’t know about it.

195
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,460
Me neither. Are they famous?

196
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,220
The school is way more than famous.

197
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,610
Tian Dou Imperial School,

198
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,860
the greatest Advanced
Soul Master School of Tian Dou Empire.

199
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,950
Previous deans of this school

200
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,780
were in charge by the emperor of
Tian Dou Empire.

201
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,740
However,

202
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,940
the first requirement to enter it is

203
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,540
the student must be of noble birth.

204
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,620
Many outstanding
civilian students can’t join.

205
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,090
That’s why only few famous soul masters
have been fostered.

206
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,890
Tian Heng, do you still recognize me?

207
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,900
You are...

208
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,180
[Next Episode]

209
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,990
Please come with me.

210
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,260
Even though Tang San is strong,

211
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,590
when it comes to one-to-one battle,

212
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,110
I’ll definitely defeat him

213
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,690
by Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon’s martial soul.

214
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,180
Little San, what brings you here?

215
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,710
Uncle,

216
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,830
why are you here?

217
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,950
Even though they are from Shrek School,

218
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,430
you can bring them to the imperial school.

219
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,390
No, I don’t consent to it.

220
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,670
They belong to Shrek School.

221
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,470
I’ve put painstaking care into
Shrek for two decades.

222
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,190
Too bad!
