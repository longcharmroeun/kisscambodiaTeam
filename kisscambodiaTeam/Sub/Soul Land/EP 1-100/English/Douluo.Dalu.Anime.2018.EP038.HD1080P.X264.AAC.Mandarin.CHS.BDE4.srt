[Previous Episode]
Friends, initiate your martial souls.

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,260
Admit your defeat.

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,230
In the state of Fanatic, we don’t feel pain.

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,120
Airborne.

24
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,960
They’re able to fly too?

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,970
Although I’m the only one left,

26
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,300
yet to win or to lose is uncertain.

27
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,130
Brother, you’re so cool!

28
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,740
Xiao Wu, get down.

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,710
Let’s go. Meal on me.

30
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,020
Brother, how generous you are!

[Soul Land]
[Episode 38]

32
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,240
Tell me how you all feel

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,610
for today’s battle soul?

34
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,610
I felt good in a single battle.

35
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,920
But we didn’t cooperate well in the group battle.

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,060
I was a burden to all during the group battle,

37
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,870
making less contribution to the team,

38
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,920
which is harder for us to
defeat a strong opponent.

39
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,630
All of you are wrong. What I want to tell is that

40
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,130
all of you have done a good job today.
I’m very satisfied.

41
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,410
You are still lack of some tacit bond,

42
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,140
but this is the very first group battle of you.

43
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,860
Plus, the opponent is a team

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,010
with the members’ levels at above 35.

45
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,400
They have gained seven-victory in a row,

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
But all of you did perform well

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,610
and won the battle.

48
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,980
What you have all done today

49
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,890
was beyond my expectation!

50
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,420
Little Ao, you shouldn’t undervalue yourself.

51
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,530
You’ve never given up in contributing to the team.

52
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,760
It’s your Swift Flight Mushroom Sausage

53
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,810
that turned danger into safety
at the crucial moment.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,640
Each of you did play an
essential role in the group battle.

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,260
Shrek Seven Devils is a team.
Each of you is indispensable.

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,410
Hey, Grandmaster!

57
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,290
Are you coming back purposely to praise the kids?

58
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,210
Of course, I’m not.
I just want to tell them that

59
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,300
they’re the best.

60
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,550
Yet, they’re still imperfect.

61
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,130
I allow all of you to rest for a day tomorrow.

62
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,030
But, you have to analyze
today’s performance together

63
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,820
and tell me before the soul battle
day after tomorrow.

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,890
And never stir up any conflicts
when we’re away,

65
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,200
especially in between soul masters.

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,840
Grandmaster is right. Don’t stir up troubles.

67
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,560
However, if someone gets on your nerves,

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,420
don’t let down of Shrek School either.

69
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,400
<i>There’s one who got on our nerves not long ago.</i>

70
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,210
Xiao Gang, these kids have brought me
more and more surprises.

71
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,490
It’s a good idea to hand them

72
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,620
over you for training.

73
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,370
They’re talented as well.

74
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,560
Their opponents are
five levels higher than them,

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,870
and the total soul rings are three more,

76
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,480
yet they still won the battle.

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,790
This proved their extraordinary talents.

78
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,850
But I’m still lost.

79
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,210
Compared with Tang San,

80
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,830
the Fatty Hong Jun is still far behind.

81
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,610
Even I’ve been teaching for years,
but I’m still not as good as you.

82
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,950
This is very obvious. You rarely admit it.

83
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,880
Am I someone who doesn’t admit the defeat?

84
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,490
It seems to be right. You did bet with me last time.

85
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,360
You lost ten gold soul coins to me.

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,370
- And, you never admit it!
- You...

87
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,740
Frander, I feel like having some beers now.

88
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,200
Since you admitted the defeat, treat us then.

89
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,780
All right! I’ll make both of you drunk.

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,290
Register for Shrek Seven Devils, please.

91
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,480
Schleck?

92
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,110
Shrek!

93
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,540

94
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,940

[Soul Land]

105
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,030
Hurry! It’ll begin soon!

106
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,360
Did you know that there’s a team of seven

107
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,650
keep a clean sweep for the past one month?

108
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,440
Clean sweep? Am I getting it right?

109
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,030
It’s said to be the first team

110
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,540
who makes the quickest and
most clean sweep in Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

111
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,980
The team is...

112
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,120
Excuse me. Register for a group battle, please.

113
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,220
Shrek Seven Devils!

114
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,840
It’s you!

115
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,090
Please hurry up.

116
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,100
Sir, please wait for a while.

117
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,320
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

118
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,390
Nice to meet you, Honorable Mr. Team Leader.

119
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,930
Is it okay for us to have a talk?

120
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,190
I won’t spend too much time.

121
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,340
Is it representing you personally?

122
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,390
Or representing Suo Tuo Soul Arena?

123
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,390
Of course, representing Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

124
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,550
Mr. Team Leader, I’ll get straight to the point.

125
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,510
On behalf of Suo Tuo Soul Arena,

126
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,080
I hereby invite Shrek Seven Devils
to join the group battle

127
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,560
at the Central Soul Arena.

128
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,180
Oh, this seems inappropriate.

129
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,770
According to the rules of Soul Arena,

130
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,300
only masters above silver battle soul
can battle at the Central Soul Arena.

131
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,410
But, Shrek Seven Devils
are just iron battle souls now.

132
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,150
You don’t have to be humble.

133
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,550
With the records achieved by
Shrek Seven Devils in this month,

134
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,230
all of them will get silver soul badges

135
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,860
after today’s soul battle.

136
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,540
There’s nothing wrong if they gain
silver battle souls one day earlier.

137
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,660
If that’s the case,

138
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,210
you shouldn’t care if it’s one day delay either.

139
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,060
To be honest,

140
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,120
three days ago, a soul master team came.

141
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,520
All of them are silver battle souls.

142
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,430
They’re probably invited
by several nobles in Suo Tuo City.

143
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,830
In these two consecutive days,

144
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,650
the nobles put a lucrative bet on them.

145
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,770
And they won the battle as expected,

146
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,510
which caused a big loss to the Soul Arena.

147
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,810
You’d have known that

148
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,620
the masters with silver battle soul

149
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,620
are generally above Level 40.

150
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,920
But, all of these team members are Soul Honors.

151
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,730
We can’t break the rules,

152
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,210
asking the Soul Sects at Level 40
to battle with them.

153
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,370
If this continues,

154
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,610
Soul Arena can’t sustain the loss.

155
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,530
As Soul Honors, they have reached
the silver battle soul.

156
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,660
It seems that they are a very strong team.

157
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,730
What team did...

158
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,700
Soul Arena used to battle
with them these two days?

159
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,230
Since Suo Tuo Soul Arena

160
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,360
doesn’t have Soul Honors of silver battle soul,

161
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
so we can only

162
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,980
send the Soul Honor of
copper battle soul to battle with them.

163
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,500
One of the team is Frenzy Battle Team.

164
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,620
But they were defeated.

165
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,330
Among the Soul Sects,

166
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,890
Frenzy Battle Team is one of the highest level.

167
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,110
Is that because of the level of silver
battle soul team higher than them?

168
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,140
The problem is not about the soul power level,

169
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,460
but the soul ring.

170
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,850
This silver battle soul team is
the same as Shrek Seven Devils.

171
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,510
they’re a team with top-level soul rings.

172
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,510
<i>Top-level soul rings?</i>

173
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,680
<i>The first soul ring is around 100 years.</i>

174
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,750
<i>The second soul ring is above 500 years.</i>

175
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,720
<i>The third soul ring is 1,000 years.</i>

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,000
<i>There will be 2 yellows and 1 purple
if it manifests on soul masters.</i>

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,030
Why does Soul Arena think Shrek Seven Devils

178
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,050
can win in the soul battle then?

179
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,630
Moreover,

180
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,990
we only have four soul masters
with a level above 40

181
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,510
and the other three don’t reach Level 30.

182
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,370
You’re too humble for this.

183
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,490
Shrek Seven Devils have kept a clean sweep

184
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,690
in the past 27 soul battles.

185
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,920
This is unprecedented in our Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

186
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,470
They must be capable

187
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,900
to compete with this silver battle soul team.

188
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,290
If I remember well,

189
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,560
there will be extra rewards if participating in

190
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,030
the battle at the Central Soul Arena.

191
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,680
Of course, to those who participate,

192
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,330
each of them will obtain
direct rewards of 500 gold soul coins.

193
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,700
In addition, since you’re invited by Soul Arena,

194
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,010
we’ll give you an extra of
10,000 gold soul coins as rewards

195
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,040
if your team can win in the battle.

196
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,230
A team that makes Suo Tuo Soul Arena
put so much attention

197
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,190
and the best soul rings the team owned,

198
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,740
this is beneficial for Shrek Seven Devils.

199
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,120
In order to cope with this battle,

200
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,280
please allow Shrek Seven Devils

201
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,760
not to participate today’s
single and double soul battles.

202
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,140
So that they can concentrate on tonight’s battle.

203
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,630
Here are the details of the opponent.

204
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,180
[Participant Information]

205
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,230
Xiao Gang,

206
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,690
you shouldn’t promise them this quick.

207
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,410
If we negotiate it,

208
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,330
they probably will reward us more.

209
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,950
If we win the battle, the reward
is already enough.

210
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,700
10,000 gold soul coins is a great amount.

211
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,700
I’ve thought it through.

212
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
1,000 coins for each kid is more than enough.

213
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,670
The remaining 3,000 will
be reserved for the school.

214
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,410
I’ll spend it on their third-phase training.

215
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,860
Do you have any problem?

216
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,060
No, we have none.

217
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,810
All right. Have a look at
the opponent’s information.

218
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,840

219
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,640

00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,680

Soul rings – 2 yellow, 1 purple.

243
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,240
<i>The team is so strong!</i>

244
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,490
I can make some guess
about the origin of Emperor Team.

245
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,740
Little San.

246
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,320
Master.

247
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,590
This time, you aren’t allowed
to use the hidden weapon.

248
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,630
But, you are allowed to use
the soul bone of Eight Spiders.

249
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,310
You must not admit defeat until the last moment.

250
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,350
Master, can’t we defeat the opponent?

251
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,750
It’s only with a 30% probability.

252
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,980
And it mainly falls on

253
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,390
you, Mu Bai and Zhu Qing.

254
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,120
Based on the details given,
the opponent of 7 persons in a team

255
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,150
is a very great equipped team.

256
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,500
You have to pay the most attention to two persons,

257
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,150
who are their Captain and Vice Captain.

258
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,560
Soul masters of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon
and Jade Phosphor Serpent.

259
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,330
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon?

260
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,430
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon is known as the
beast soul with the strongest attack power.

261
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,140
Its status in beast soul

262
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,400
is similar to the status of Rong Rong’s
Qibao Amber Pagoda

263
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,810
in Assisting Branch of Martial Soul.

264
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,570
So, is their captain from the
family of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon?

265
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,110
Apart from the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon family,

266
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,270
I’ve never heard of any other
soul masters of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon yet.

267
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,450
The background of Emperor Team is overwhelming!

268
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,810
Not only both captains,

269
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,170
but Black Martial Turtle also has the same
level as Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

270
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,510
They are the top in the
Defense Branch of Martial Soul.

271
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,480
As for the soul master of Jade Phosphor Serpent,

272
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,690
she makes me think of a person.

273
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,220
Frander, do you still remember him?

274
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,860
Jade Phosphor Serpent?

275
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,020
Are you saying...

276
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,490
[Next Episode] This time, you’re going
to encounter a strong opponent.

277
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,630
This is the key person.

278
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,490
I’ll tell you after the battle is over.

279
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,050
The Central Soul Arena is very magnificent.

280
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,190
Next, let’s welcome the members of both teams.

281
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,190
I’ll tell you after the battle is over.

282
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,610
You got into my trap!

283
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,290
Thunder Dragon Claws.
