00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,850
It seems

36
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,050
15 teams of Tian Dou Empire
who are qualified for the final round

37
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,150
are joining the troop gradually.

38
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,960
Little San, what are you thinking about?

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,460
I’m thinking that

40
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,800
to us, they are not threats.

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,740
The real threat will be the chosen team
from Martial Soul Hall.

42
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,140
Only by defeating them,

43
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,620
we can be the final champion.

44
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,860
Indeed. Challenging them

45
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,780
is going to be the biggest trial
for Shrek Seven Devils.

46
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,620
Oh, right, Dean.

47
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,700
How is the competition venue, Martial Soul City?

48
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,340
Martial Soul City almost belongs
to Martial Soul Hall.

49
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,760
It’s located at the border
of the two empires.

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,720
However, neither empires have its ownership.

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,280
Most importantly,

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,740
one of the two noblest symbols
of Martial Soul Hall,

53
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,940
the Sacred Temple
is located in Martial Soul City.

54
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,060
It seems there are a lot of things
to eat and to explore.

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,380
After the tournament,

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,620
we must have fun in Martial Soul City.

<i>Martial Soul City.</i>

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,660
However, the venue for the final round was
not supposed to be in Martial Soul City.

59
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,060
For reasons unknown,

60
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,300
Martial Soul Hall made a sudden decision

61
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,240
of having the final round in Martial Soul City.

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
Sudden decision?

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,440
Please hold on.
I would like to go to Chi Huo School.

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,300
Please allow me.

65
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,820
Brothers of Chi Huo School, may I come in?

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,100
Brother Xiao Tian, what’s the matter?

67
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,920
Nothing. Is Sister Huo Wu here?

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,100
I’m here to apologize.

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,080
For what?

70
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,660
You didn’t do anything wrong.

71
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,260
Sister Huo Wu, sorry.

72
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,720
I couldn’t fulfill your request.

73
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,000
I was defeated by Tang San.

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,620
Stop it. You’re not wrong.

75
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,360
Since he’s the descendant of Hao Tian Tribe,

76
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,900
everything is reasonable.

77
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,560
It’s okay that you lost.

78
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,180

81
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,200
and which place he will get.

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,900

at the cavalries?

Do you want to be a warrior too?

89

been the best warriors.

Besides being disciplined,
they’re very well-trained.

What’s so good about them?

95
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,860
Isn’t that natural for cavalries?

96

97
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,220
and have a look in the troop?

98
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,220
