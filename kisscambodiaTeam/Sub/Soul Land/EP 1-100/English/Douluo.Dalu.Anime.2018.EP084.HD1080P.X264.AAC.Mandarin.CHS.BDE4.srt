[Previous Episode]
If possible,

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,580
I’d like to send some of our youth
to learn in Shrek School.

25
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,260
I hereby announce

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,820
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament, Qualifying Rounds,

27
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,500
officially begins!

28
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,420
I wonder who they are?
It’s Shrek, the losers of Suo Tuo City.

29
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,740
Many people are living under
their suppression in Suo Tuo City.

30
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,860
- Xiao Wu, in this duel...
- See you.

31
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,460
You must put them to shame.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,700
Next.

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,180
[Soul Land]
[Episode 84]

34
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,780
Why? You’re not convinced?

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,180
You...

36
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,220
Or do you want a gang fight?

37
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,820
Are you keen to die?

38
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,100
This is a competition.

39
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
What are you doing?

40
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,980
Platinum Chiefs, please calm down.

41
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,020
We just want to bring our member out.

42
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,500
We mean nothing.

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,540
Remember your identity.

44
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,100
If participants who are not involved
enter the stage again

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,260
will be expelled from
the tournament immediately.

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,740
I hope you’ll leave safely
in the next round.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
After the accident happened just now,

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,100
the competition continues.

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,140
[Barak School: Jakes] vs. [Shrek School: Xiao Wu]

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Start.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,100
Shrek School won.

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,380
[Winner: Xiao Wu]

53
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,020
Shrek School won.

54
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,100
[Scott] vs. [Xiao Wu]

55
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,180
Shrek School won.

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,140
What’s wrong?

57
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,500
Why is Barak so lousy?

58
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,780
Barak sent another Soul Sect.

59
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,820
How will he perform in this round?

60
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,300
Let’s wait and see.

61
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,340
You have to pay for what you have done.

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,300
Raise your fist then.

63
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,100
Start.

64
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
First soul skill.

65
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,380
Flower Bloom.

66
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,500
What a Level 40 Soul Sect.

67
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,260
He’s able to control the arena instantly.

68
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,820
With such firm manipulation,

69
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,420
Barak School has got the upper hand this round.

70
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,700
<i>Although Olby’s control never stops,</i>

71
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,780
<i>with Xiao Wu’s speed,</i>

72
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,300
<i>she could have escaped from it.</i>

73
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,820
Second soul skill, Flower Turbo Spread.

74
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,700
This...

75
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,900
What’s going on?

76
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,260
It’s Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

77
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,240
Darn it.

78
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,100
Since the sunflower attacks Xiao Wu,

79
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,540
Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet
considers it as an offence.

80
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,900
As the king of flower, how could it endure?

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,500
Are we going against the rules?

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,900
Even Master can’t figure it out,

83
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,980
not to mention those judges.

84
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,140
Besides, it isn’t Xiao Wu who used it.

85
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,220
It can’t be considered a violation.

86
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,740
What’s going on?

87
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,380
It seems I have to...

88
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,740
Third soul skill, Spurting Sun.

89
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,740
You next opponent’s martial soul is Sunflower.

90
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,540
You don’t have to resist his attacks.

91
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,900
After winning, if somebody asks you,
you don’t have to answer.

92
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,180
OK.

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,620
I never expect

94
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,980
one of Shrek’s student has a soul bone.

95
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,820
Maybe they have covered up their strength.

96
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,460
But isn’t this soul bone too powerful?

97
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,620
It can make its rival’s martial soul
wilt instantly.

98
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,220
Your Majesty, if I’m not mistaken,

99
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,060
Xiao Wu’s soul skill must be very targeted.

100
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,300
Only martial soul from Plant Branch
can be restrained.

101
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,700
I agree with Chief Ning.

102
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,700
This should be a common soul bone.

103
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,300
It just worked at a certain time.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,180
What ability did you use?

105
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,860
In this round,

106
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,300
Shrek School won.

107
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,380
Although Xiao Wu’s soul power
is temporarily behind,

108
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,820
she’s excellent in melee.

109
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,100
Xiao Wu has won five rounds consecutively.

110
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,980
I’m afraid she will be hurt, if she continues.

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,820
Yes.

112
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,420
Barak School seems to
have no rivals worth dueling with.

113
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,860
Settle the rest as quickly as possible.

114
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,100
Send Little San to duel with them.

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,620
So that we can cover up
our strength as much as possible.

116
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,380
OK.

117
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,260
Little San,

118
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,860
next round is your turn.

119
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,300
Yes.

120
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,180
Shrek changes their participant.

121
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,420
[Shrek School]

122
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,820
Brother, what’s wrong
with the glow around me?

123
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,820
How could a sunflower

124
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,100
challenge the king of flower?

125
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,500
<i>Blue Silver Cage.</i>

126
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,900
<i>We lost.</i>

127
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
<i>No, we lost.</i>

128
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,820
Tang San,

129
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,500
I’ve worked so hard

130
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,620
and finally made a breakthrough.

131
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,020
<i>Xuan Tian Strike.</i>

132
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,660
I’ll definitely defeat you

133
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,380
next time.

134
00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:00,790
[Soul Land]

135
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,300
Blue Silver Plant.

136
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,260
Little San, what is he doing?

137
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,900
No,

138
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,140
how could Little San...

139
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,380
Duelling with Barak School,

140
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,340
I think Little San is using a good one.

141
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Shrek School won.

142
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Let’s talk privately.

143
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,620
Tang San, when it’s our turn to duel,

144
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,700
I hope you can duel with me.

145
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,500
Let’s fight fairly.

146
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,340
Sorry,

147
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,180
I can’t promise you.

148
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,300
You don’t dare to fight with me?

149
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,220
The sequence of the duel

150
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,700
is arranged by our teachers.

151
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,740
I don’t have the right to decide.

152
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:41,980
You...

153
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,300
But if we meet in the duel,

154
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,660
I’m willing to have a fair fight with you.

155
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Good.

156
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,900
Remember what you’ve said.

157
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,620
Your rival for tomorrow is Chi Huo School.

158
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,420
Why is Chi Huo School again?

159
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,660
Fourth soul skill, Fire Dance Dazzling Sun!

160
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,300
Qualifying rounds are
a round-robin competition.

161
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,220
It isn’t a bad thing to fight them early.

162
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,340
What formation do you think
should be used in this fight?

163
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,340
Grandmaster, please send me first.

164
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,260
You can punish me if I lose.

165
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,100
Grandmaster, only Huo Wu Shuang and Huo Wu
are considered strong in Chi Huo School.

166
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,020
Judging from today’s competition,

167
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,700
just send Little San and me to duel,

168
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,380
our victory is guaranteed.

169
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,620
I suggest Tang San going first,

170
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
and you’ll wrap it up.

171
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,940
Why?

172
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,780
Isn’t it better to start with
a soul master from Storm Attack?

173
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,780
Yes,

174
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,260
that is a commonly same tactic,

175
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,780
so we’ll act reversely.

176
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,500
Little San as a soul master from Control Branch,

177
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,220
his nature resists those
from Storm Attack Branch.

178
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
I see.

179
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,460
Since Fatty strongly requested it,

180
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,260
I think he can be the second to duel.

181
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,540
We knew Fatty has been training so hard,

182
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,420
it’s time to check his results.

183
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,980
Your analysis is correct.

184
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,300
Hence, tomorrow we’ll send

185
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Little San, Ma Hong Jun,
Zhu Zhu Qing, Xiao Wu, and Mu Bai.

186
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,460
But I have to remind you that

187
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,660
even in the qualifying rounds,

188
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,420
all teams may not use their full strength.

189
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,340
You have to hide yours too.

190
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,500
Rest early then.

191
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,780
Any problem?

192
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,180
There’re seven quotas reserved to fight,
but Grandmaster only mentioned five.

193
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,660
Isn’t that insufficient?

194
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,980
Senior is right.

195
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,740
They first sent Huo Wu Shuang
from Storm Attack Branch.

196
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,780
It seems like the first round
is quite easy.

197
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,420
This round may be difficult for Little San.

198
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,980
Why?

199
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,940
We’ve won Chi Huo School
in the previous team battle.

200
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,020
Only unexpected tactics can defeat rivals.

201
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,980
But Little San’s ability to fire resistance
isn’t a secret anymore.

202
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
It’ll be slightly difficult for him to win.

203
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,980
Grandmaster, let’s believe Little San.

204
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,220
Brother, come on.

205
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,420
Next,

206
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,020
Chi Huo School versus Shrek School.

207
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,500
Both teams sent their main force
in the first round.

208
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,580
Huo Wu Shuang and Tang San.

209
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,260
Start.

210
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,060
Third soul skill, Constraint of Spider Web.

211
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,420
It’s useless to me.

212
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:56,820
This...

213
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,620
Little San is being suppressed.

214
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
<i>Now I got it.</i>

215
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,500
<i>It seems Huo Wu Shuang has prepared
for Blue Silver Plant’s fire resistance.</i>

216
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,500
<i>Even Blue Silver Plant can immune
to both water and fire,</i>

217
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,779
<i>but Huo can compress
and condense his soul power</i>

218
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,300
<i>to produce an explosion.</i>

219
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,940
Huo Wu Shuang has completely
got the upper hand.

220
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,980
How will Tang San deal with this?

221
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,540
I did mention that your fire-resistance
Blue Silver Plant is useless to me.

222
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,100
<i>Do you think you can win?</i>

223
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,740
<i>Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.</i>

224
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,740
<i>How could it be?</i>

225
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,460
<i>It’s like hitting on a soft barrier,</i>

226
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,100
<i>I can’t feel my force.</i>

227
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,940
[Next Episode]

228
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,500
What’s going on?

229
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,260
The Five Elements Schools
are comparable in strength.

230
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,460
She must have other intentions
in exhausting soul power substantially.

231
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,220
I never expect Tang San
could be so mean.

232
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,300
The competition is over.

233
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,580
It’s better not let him duel again
in the qualifying rounds.
