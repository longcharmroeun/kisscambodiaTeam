[Previous Episode]
Fifth soul skill, Gravity Squeeze.

21
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,580
Such a small hammer. I’ll give you a lesson.

22
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,310
Teacher Zhao, did we pass?

23
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,050
Yes, you passed.

24
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,200
The Grand Soul Land Master.

25
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,790
You hit the young one.
The older one will of course ask for justice.

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,990
Let’s begin.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,950
[Soul Land]
[Episode 16]

28
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,500
Zhao Wu Ji,

29
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,510
do you understand now?

30
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,260
Thank you

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,550
for your guidance, Lord Hao Tian.

32
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,340
Consider that

33
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,020
as your compensation.

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,180
Thank you in advance.

35
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,600
Frander,

36
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,880
you’re a non-loyal friend.

37
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,200
If it weren’t for

38
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,400
the Lord’s kindness...

39
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,070
What do you know?

40
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,050
If he were to mean harm,

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,530
even if I fought alongside you,

42
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,590
do you think we would escape death?

43
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,820
He dares to attack the Pope,

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,460
he has no fear.

45
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,520
You don’t even understand that.

46
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,140
I just didn’t expect

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,300
him to be...

48
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,660
I understand you.

49
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,680
You just didn’t want to infuriate him.

50
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,720
But

51
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,530
I was so badly hit,

52
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,510
can’t you just let me whine?

53
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,130
His power is really scary.

54
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,000
Perhaps...

55
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,430
not many people in this land...

56
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,510
can be his equal.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,990
No Grand Soul Land Master

58
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,180
should be triggered.

59
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,010
Where is this?

60
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,990
You’re awake.

61
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,290
This is our dorm.

62
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,830
I heard you fought Teacher Zhao alone today.

63
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,980
You made Teacher Zhao suffer great loss.

64
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,410
I didn’t expect you to be so fierce.

65
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,230
That was Teacher Zhao.

66
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,340
You’re called Tang San, right?

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,570
I’m Oscar.

68
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,420
Soul master of Level 29.

69
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,110
My Martial Soul is Sausage.

70
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,290
My nickname is The Sausage Ocar.

71
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,470
You may call me Little Ao.

72
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,190
Where’s Xiao Wu?

73
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,600
How is she?

74
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,270
Xiao Wu?

75
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,080
Oh, Xiao Wu is fine..

76
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,650
She shares the same room
as the pretty Ning Rong Rong.

77
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,170
She should be fine after sleeping.

78
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,890
Sadly she didn’t eat my sausage.

79
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,780
Or else she would be awake by now.

80
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,150
Ning Rong Rong from Qibao Amber Tribe

81
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,180
is gorgeous.

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,140
Forget about your sausage.

83
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,550
Uncle Sausage.

84
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,440
What Uncle Sausage?

85
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,900
I’ll shave my beard tomorrow.

86
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,090
I’ll show you my handsome,

87
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,800
elegant,

88
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,100
and cool side..

89
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,580
There are some pretty juniors
in our school now.

90
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,420
I can’t be so dispirited.

91
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,250
Mu Bai obviously likes the beautiful cool girl.

92
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,480
Xiao Wu is yours.

93
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,020
So I’ll have no choice

94
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,250
but to pursue Ning Rong Rong.

95
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,510
Xiao Wu and I

96
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,790
are just friends.

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,720
Alright,

98
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,430
stop pretending.

99
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,640
We’re both men.

100
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,570
I understand.

101
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,540
At a young age,

102
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,010
you have such a pretty girlfriend.

103
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,170
The two of you came to the school alone,

104
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,220
and nothing happened in between?

105
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,990
Boss Dai said,

106
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,360
just because Xiao Wu is injured,

107
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,630
that’s why you fought Teacher Zhao so hard.

108
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,700
Who would believe that

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,810
the two of you are just friends?

110
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,160
But don’t you worry.

111
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,170
I have my principles.

112
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,630
Don’t be polite with your friend’s wife.

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,160
No.

114
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,350
I mean be polite

115
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,650
with your friend’s wife.

116
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,080
I will not fall for your Xiao Wu.

117
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,090
Rong Rong.

118
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,510
Tang San.

119
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,690
Tang San.

120
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,160
<i>The defence skill of Teacher Zhao</i>

121
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,970
<i>is stunning.</i>

122
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,940
<i>Fortunately, he wasn’t fast enough.</i>

123
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,700
<i>If not,</i>

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,150
<i>I wouldn’t have no chance at all.</i>

125
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,100
<i>I have to figure something out.</i>

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,490
<i>Or else, when I meet such an opponent
in the future...</i>

127
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,540
<i>Maybe,</i>

128
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,850
<i>I should make some machinery hidden weapon,</i>

129
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,030
<i>in order to fight strong opponents like Teacher Zhao.</i>

130
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,280
<i>Angered Buddha’s Lotus.</i>

131
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,230
<i>Pear Blossom Shower.</i>

132

<i>Peacock Plumes.</i>

133
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,680
<i>However,</i>

134
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,380
<i>the production of these weapons is difficult...</i>

135
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,400
<i>The material required</i>

136
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,650
<i>is also hard to get.</i>

137
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,560
<i>It’s impossible to make them</i>

138
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,040
<i>in such condition.</i>

139
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,380
<i>It seems I have to train harder.</i>

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,460
<i>Find the opportunity</i>

141
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,980
<i>to make some poison.</i>

142
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,230
Little Ao,

143
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,820
get up.

144
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,230
What’s going on?

145
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,190
Let me sleep.

146
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,330
Get up.

147
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,170
It’s late now.

148
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,040
Don’t you know that morning
is the best hour?

149
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,820
I’m different from you guys.

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,890
You guys are war soul masters.

151
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,190
I’m a tool soul master.

152
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,660
I’m even from the Food Branch.

153
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,960
I don’t need to train

154
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,460
as hard as you guys.

155
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,750
Brother,

156
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,390
please stop making a row.

157
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,810
Let me sleep a little longer.

158
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,280
Then tell me where Xiao Wu is living.

159
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,260
I want to see if she has recovered.
Then tell me where Xiao Wu is living.

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Go left when you’re outside of our dorm.

161
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,530
In about 30 meter,

162
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,090
there’s a wooden house.

163
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,280
That’s where Xiao Wu and Ning Rong Rong live.

164
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,940
But

165
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,310
I have to remind you.

166
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,890
The school rules specify that...

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,970
male students aren’t allowed
to disturb female students.

168
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,130
The school rules are strict.

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
Shrek School takes up

170
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,450
a third area of this village.

171
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,350
The other side is where the villagers live.

172
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,330
Don’t go there.

173
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,800
Xiao Wu,

174
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,860
are you feeling better?

175
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,310
Rong Rong is training.

176
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,530
Don’t disturb her.

177
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,790
Let’s talk elsewhere.

178
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,350
It was my fault yesterday.

179
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,690
I didn’t protect you well.

180
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,720
The teacher was too powerful.

181
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,990
How can I blame you?

182
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,400
This place is different from Nuoding.

183
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,750
It seems that everyone is powerful.

184
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,450
Luckily,

185
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
no one with the highest soul level has appeared.

186
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,540
How do you know if there’s no one
in the school with highest soul level?

187
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,360
Teacher Zhao is just the Deputy Dean.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,090
Maybe the Dean has the highest soul level.

189
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,710
I was just guessing.

190
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,970
After all,

191
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,170
why would a Grand Soul Land Master
stay quietly in such place?

192
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,620
Let’s go.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,490
Go to find some food.

194
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,690
Okay.

195
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,780
[Soul Land]

196
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,930
Ma Hong Jun,

197
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,410
stop seeing me.

198
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,920
I’ll not be with you anymore.

199
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,250
Cui Hua,

200
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,500
am I not nice to you?

201
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,720
Why are you breaking up with me?

202
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,540
You’re nice to me,

203
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,100
But...

204
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,910
Your Martial Soul is...

205
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,010
The Dean said,

206
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,950
there would be a way soon.

207
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,360
Give me a little more time.

208
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,360
No.

209
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,180
Don’t.

210
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,560
I have to consider my family’s safety.

211
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,330
Stop.

212
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,060
What a beautiful girl.

213
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:37,550
What?

214
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,280
You want to be my girlfriend after her?

215
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,530
Okay,

216
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,020
no problem.

217
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,760
I agree.

218
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,060
No way.

219
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,590
You little rogue.

220
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,760
You’re young and yet doing bad.

221
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,600
Are you trying to...

222
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,770
seize this girl in public?

223
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,600
This is our matter.

224
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,530
Stop being busybody.

225
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,830
Since you don’t want to be my woman,

226
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,620
leave then.

227
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,590
You...

228
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,210
You’re called Ma Jun Hong, right?

229
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,270
Please stop disturbing this lady.

230
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,280
Who do you think you are?

231
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,340
How dare you interrupt your “father’s” business?

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,800
Are you looking for trouble?

233
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,650
Whose father are you?

234
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,750
I’m the father of

235
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,620
those who’re busybody.

236
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,500
So? You can’t hit me, right?

237
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,060
<i>This fatty has</i>

238
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
<i>similar soul power as mine.</i>

239
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,890
<i>This isn’t so easy.</i>

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,950
You’re a soul master too.

241
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,920
No wonder you dare to interrupt me.

242
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,580
I’ll show you what is actual strength.

243
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,120
The Merging of Phoenix.

244
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,650
Phoenix?

245
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,620
<i>Grandmaster has mentioned,</i>

246
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,540
<i>there are some</i>

247
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,760
<i>very powerful soul beasts.</i>

248
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,830
<i>One of them</i>

249
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,720
<i>is phoenix.</i>

250
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,730
<i>Phoenix is also called seven-color bird.</i>

251
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>Other than giving the owner flying ability,</i>

252
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,740
<i>it also has strong fire attacking power.</i>

253
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,870
<i>It’s the best of the combat type Martial Soul.</i>

254
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,280
Is there such a fat phoenix?

255
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,240
I think he looks more like a chicken.

256
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,630
Who are you calling a chicken?

257
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,300
First soul skill, Phoenix Firing Line.

258
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,070
Be careful.

259
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,550
What’s that?

260
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,540
Have a taste of

261
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,100
the undying bird’s fury.

262
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,800
<i>That’s not good.</i>

263
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,670
Little San.

264
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:36,790
Don’t worry.

265
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,840
According to my observation,

266
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,980
the temperature of his flame is high,

267
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,550
but the attacking distance is only 5 meter.

268
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,400
If we limit his mobility...

269
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,710
<i>Blue Silver Plant?</i>

270
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,230
<i>Oh, no.</i>

271
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,610
<i>He recognized the shortcoming
of Phoenix Firing Line.</i>

272
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,110
<i>But the next one...</i>

273
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,930
<i>Oh, no.</i>

274
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,470
<i>Although my Blue Silver Plant has 2 soul rings,</i>

275
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,890
<i>as a plant,</i>

276
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,640
<i>it’s still afraid of fire.</i>

277
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,940
<i>His Martial Soul,</i>

278
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,450
<i>is my nemesis.</i>

279
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,180
Let me do this.

280
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,580
Xiao Wu.

281
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Second soul skill,

282
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,470
Fire Bathing Phoenix.

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,240
<i>Rascal,</i>

284
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,330
<i>how dare you say that I’m a chicken?</i>

285
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,730
<i>This is my second soul skill.</i>

286
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,950
<i>Besides having complete defense,
it can also attack.</i>

287
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,420
<i>If I don’t give you a lesson,</i>

288
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,510
<i>I won’t be called the Devil Phoenix.</i>

289
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,500
<i>But she’s quite pretty.</i>

290
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,400
<i>It’s better not to burn her.</i>

291
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,080
<i>The flame has gone weaker.</i>

292
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,920
<i>Is the fatty showing mercy?</i>

293
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,890
<i>Okay, I’ll be gentler to you then.</i>

294
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,940
That was my first soul skill,

295
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,280
Arched Body.

296
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,970
The Arched Body of Xiao Wu...

297
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,760
can increase

298
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,280
her waist power up to 100%...

299
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,970
and her body tenacity up to 50%.

300
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,670
Besides,

301
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,320
after her soul power achieved Level 10,

302
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
every level of increment

303
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,690
can raise the effect by 1%.

304
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,100
I’m at Level 29 now.

305
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,430
That means...

306
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,710
my waist power has increased to 119%.

307
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,480
If I can get near to someone,

308
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,680
those below Level 50

309
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,760
won’t be able to handle it.

310
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,330
Although your Fire Bathing Phoenix

311
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,220
is powerful,

312
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,840
when I release my soul power,

313
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,670
there is no problem to defense

314
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,020
when I pass the firing line.

315
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,100
How is it, Fatty?

316
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:39,990
You want to fight again?

317
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,600
Stop fighting.

318
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,240
Stop fighting.

319
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,540
Stop fighting.

320
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,370
How are you?

321
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,130
Miss Cui Hua, you...

322
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,530
I’m not dead.

323
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,840
Little Rabbit.

324
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,760
Let’s fight again.

325
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,080
[Next Episode]

326
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,850
The Dean is here.

327
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,260
Little San, do you think this profiteer
uncle still remember us?

328
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,880
My master told me to give you this.

329
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,110
Okay, I get it.

330
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,500
Uncle Sword.

331
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,080
Well, I have super red bean bun. Back off.

332
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,660
What’s going on?
