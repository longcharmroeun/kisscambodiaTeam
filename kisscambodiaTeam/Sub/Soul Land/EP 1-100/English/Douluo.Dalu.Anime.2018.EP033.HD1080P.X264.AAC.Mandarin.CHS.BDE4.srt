We both are strong enough,

Perhaps the aim of this punishment

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,530
Oscar and the rest are not awake.

180
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,040
They must be very tired. Let’s train.

181
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,070
Go ahead. Just leave this to me.

182
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,060
Very good.
Someone didn’t complete the punishment.

183
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:05,840
However,

184
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,550
you have reflected the spirit
of not leaving behind and not giving up.

Brother, I’ll accompany you,
as I promised yesterday.

189
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,670
Let’s go together. Aren’t we a team?

190
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,290
It’s good to warm up.

191
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,280
I should lose some weight.
It isn’t easy to be this fat.

192
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,140
Stop the nonsense. Keep up.

193
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,080
<i>This group of youngsters</i>

194
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,880

[Next Episode]

199
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,690
Do you think you can escape?

200
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,020
I have an idea.

201
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,990
What is that person’s name?

202
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,500
Hello, Uncle.

203
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,770
You have to help me find justice.

204
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,870
What’s actually going on?

205
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,260
What a beauty.
It seems I won’t be lonely tonight.
