00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,470
[Previous Episode]
Mr. Team Leader.

21
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,370
On behalf of Suo Tuo Soul Arena,

22
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,910
I hereby invite Shrek Seven Devils
to join the group battle

23
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,190
at the Central Soul Arena.

24
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,060
Here are the details of the opponent.

25
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,880
I can make some guess
about the origin of Emperor Team.

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,230
You have to pay the most attention to two persons,

27
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,760
who are their Captain and Vice Captain.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,140
It’s only with a 30% probability.

29
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,740
You must not admit defeat until the last moment.

30
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,920
Xiao Gang,

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
I think that you shouldn’t
promise them in a hurry.

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,440
I’ve never heard of any other
soul masters of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon yet.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
Are you saying...?

34
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,000
[Soul Land]
[Episode 39]

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,820
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,060
is known as the
beast soul with the strongest attack power.

37
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,870
Its status in beast soul

38
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,060
is similar to the status
of Rong Rong’s Qibao Amber Pagoda

39
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,170
in Assisting Branch of Martial Soul.

40
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,430
So, is their captain

41
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,160
from the family of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon?

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,450
Apart from the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon family,

43
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,560
I’ve never heard of any other
soul masters of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon yet.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,880
The background of Emperor Team is overwhelming!

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,210
Not only both captains,

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,610
but the Black Martial Turtle also has
the same level as Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

47
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,960
They are the top in the
Defense Branch of Martial Soul.

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,980
As for the soul master of
Jade Phosphor Serpent,

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,130
she makes me think of a person.

50
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,600
Frander, do you still remember him?

51
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,410
Jade Phosphor Serpent?

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,870
Are you saying...?

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,850
I’m talking about him.

54
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,940
Jade Phosphor Serpent is similar
to that of several big families.

55
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,350
It’s a rare martial soul.

56
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,980
School Dean, Grandmaster,
who are you talking about?

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,960
Among the soul masters who own the martial soul,

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,970
there’s only a famous one.

59
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,660
He’s being known as
The Grand Jade Phosphor Master.

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,730
Are you talking the Poison Master?

61
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,360
The most difficult to tackle one,
The Grand Jade Phosphor Master.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,800
There’s no one else other than him.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,750
The vice captain of Emperor Team

64
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
is having the same surname of Dugu
as The Grand Jade Phosphor Master.

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,290
Master, the soul master of Jade Phosphor Serpent

66
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,820
is in Controlling Branch.

67
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,720
I wonder how she controls it.

68
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,610
It’s not easy to control if using the serpent martial soul.

69
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,390
Poison.

70
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,070
Poison?

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,740
If that is the case,

72
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,260
we’ll have a chance to defeat them!

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,140
Little San, never underestimate the opponent!

74
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,430
Oscar’s Detoxifying Small Sausage
is only in its second soul ring.

75
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,610
It may not bear with the
poison of Jade Phosphor Serpent.

76
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,980
Yes, Master.

77
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,010
Grandmaster, may I say something?

78
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,700
Yes, go ahead.

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,080
During the battle,

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,680
we must focus on

81
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,620
the soul master of Assisting Branch
of the opponent.

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh? Why?

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,590
I know the martial soul of
Nine Heart Flowering Apple.

84
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,880
It has only one ability of
general healing in the scope.

85
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,320
General healing in the scope?

86
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,610
The degree of healing is
controlled by soul master’s intentions.

87
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,780
The higher the level,
the more the soul ring,

88
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,040
the more the healing power can be used.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,070
My father said,

90
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,900
if there’s a soul master with
Nine Heart Flowering Apple,

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,970
it’ll not be easy to die even if you want.

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,390
This is an almost perfect combination.

93
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,240
We can win.

94
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,240
Mu Bai, Little Ao, Fatty, Xiao Wu, Rong Rong, Zhu Qing.

95
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,580
Have you forgotten that

96
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,020
we’ve already achieved a winning streak of 27?

97
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,810
In the previous battles,

98
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,010
we won by defeating the strong opponents.

99
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,840
We have Mu Bai’s top martial soul
of Storm Attack Branch,

100
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,520
Little Ao’s capability of
holding the battle continuously,

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,360
Fatty’s top Mutated Beast Soul,

102
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,390
and Xiao Wu’s magical Rou skill.

103
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,700
Rong Rong, do you think your Qibao Amber Pagoda

104
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,880
is not comparable with
Nine Heart Flowering Apple?

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,140
And Zhu Qing...

106
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
You’re the most speedy
among those of Keen Attack Branch

107
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,410
at the same level that I’ve ever seen.

108
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,730
Although the opponent is strong,
we aren’t weak.

109
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,220
If we lose the confidence to win,

110
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,410
why should we participate in the battle?

111
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,680
Little San, you’re right.

112
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,910
We, Shrek Seven Devils
are never afraid of anyone else.

113
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,220
Yes, Shrek Seven Devils will surely win.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,540
Yes, Shrek Seven Devils will surely win.

115
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,030
Win!

116
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,810
Win!

117
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Let’s guess

118
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,780
what kind of opponent will be
arranged by Soul Arena for us tonight?

119
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,700
Any opponent will be useless.

120
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,920
No one can compete with us.

121
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,530
Ling Ling, if we get hurts,

122
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,630
you have to cure me first.

123
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,630
Teacher.

124
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,490
This time, you’re going to
encounter a strong opponent.

125
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,760
Here is your opponent tonight.
[Participant Information]

126
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,630
Team of Shrek Seven Devils.

127
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,580
Seven team members with iron soul badges.

128
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,650
They’re already qualified
to obtain a silver battle soul.

129
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,470
- Please.
- Suo Tuo Soul Arena has

130
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,850
already decided to grant them
the Silver qualification in advance.

131
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,630
This comes at the time to battle with you all.

132
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,030
Being granted silver battle soul in advance?

133
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,430
Does Suo Tuo Soul Arena have no more

134
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,250
silver battle soul team to battle with us?

135
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,980
Never underestimate the opponent!

136
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,180
Shrek Seven Devils team won
the Frenzy Battle Team before.

137
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,160
Frenzy Battle Team?
How can they make it?

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,710
This is the key person.

139
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,620
A soul master with Blue Silver Plant.

140
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,550
Moreover, pay attention to the
soul master of Qibao Amber Pagoda too.

141
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,980
As well as the captain of the team.

142
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,770
He won’t be the captain if he’s not outstanding.

143
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,430
This battle is indeed a tough one.

144
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,540
I have a request for every one of you.

145
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,620
No matter how the battle goes,

146
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,280
never hurt the opponent.

147
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,420
Especially you, Yan Zi.

148
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,130
If they got poisoned by you,

149
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,130
you have to detoxify them immediately
after the battle.

150
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,330
Why?

151
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,830
I’ll tell you when the battle is over.

152
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,680
Welcome to Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

153
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,260
It’s my honor to see everyone again.

154
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,500
I’m the host of tonight’s soul battle, Dou Dou.

155
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,850
Next, let’s welcome the members of both teams.

156
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,330
Look! Look!

157
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,090
Purple hair and green eyes.

158
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,070
Does such color of eyes and hair
exist in this world?

159
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,080
The Central Soul Arena is very magnificent.

160
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,480
This is the highest-standard stage
of Suo Tuo Soul Arena.

161
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,980
The diameter of this soul battle stage
is up to 70 meters.

162
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,430
The auditorium is large enough
to accommodate 20,000 spectators.

163
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,280
It’s a retro and ancient style of an auditorium.

164
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,120
This is a tribute to the ancient soul masters.

165
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,830
Do you know the leader of the opponent?

166
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,110
I’ll tell you when the battle is over.

167
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,840
<i>It’s not easy to battle with this guy.</i>

168
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,840
Attention, please.

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,940
You have one minute from now
to initiate your martial soul.

170
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,500
The battle will begin once I announce.

171
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,520
The battle will end when either team

172
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,520
admits defeat or falls off from the battle stage.

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,740
Initiate your martial soul now.

174
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,280
[Soul Land]

175
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,460
This... Is this...?

176
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,060
You’ve finally seen it?
This is the third tribe in the world.

177
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,160
The only martial soul owned by
the tribe of Blue Lightning.

178
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,320
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

179
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,620
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon is the top martial soul.

180
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,650
It’s different from the other martial souls.

181
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,890
The soul ring of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon

182
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,010
can only be the soul beast of
toothed-dragon species.

183
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,620
This means its soul skill is superb.

184
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,820
<i>Master said, the soul master
of Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon</i>

185
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,560
<i>is the most terrifying soul master of
Storm Attack Branch at the same level.</i>

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,490
<i>As expected,</i>

187
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,850
<i>he’s absolute confidence in his own strength.</i>

188
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,480
Soul battle begins.

189
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,820
First soul skill,
White Tiger Protection Barrier.

190
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,920
<i>The best soul ring combination
of 2 yellow and 1 purple</i>

191
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,090
<i>brings a great pressure indeed.</i>

192
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,390
<i>Either the quality of martial soul</i>

193
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>or the configuration of soul rings,</i>

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,960
<i>Shrek Seven Devils are indeed at a disadvantage.</i>

195
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,520
<i>However, this is their advantage of
encountering the other soul battle teams.</i>

196
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,660
<i>The advantage might turn into a disadvantage.</i>

197
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,760
<i>Little San, what are you going to do?</i>

198
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,870
<i>I’m forcibly blocked by two of them at the front.</i>

199
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,780
<i>I can’t exert pressure on the other
members of Emperor Team behind them.</i>

200
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,500
<i>I’ll tackle two of them first.</i>

201
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,090
<i>They’re retracted!</i>

202
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,390
<i>Up there!</i>

203
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,560
<i>Unexpectedly, the Black Martial Turtle is tough.</i>

204
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,780
You got into my trap!
First soul skill, Thunder Dragon Claws.

205
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,640
Oh, no!

206
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,420
I exert power in the air.
You have nowhere to hide.

207
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,430
It’s you who got into the trap.

208
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,110
[Next Episode]
First soul skill, Intertwine.

209
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,360
The favorable situation
that Little San established is useless now.

210
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,000
The real battle starts now!

211
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,940
I’ll kill you all!

212
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,400
The lives of Shrek Seven Devils are at stake.

213
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,020
No!
