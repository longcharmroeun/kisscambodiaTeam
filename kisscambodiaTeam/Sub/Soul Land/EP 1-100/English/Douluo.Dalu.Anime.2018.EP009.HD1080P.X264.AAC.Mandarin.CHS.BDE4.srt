Little San, I’m still alive.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,610
Master, you’re alive well.

22
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,590
I can attack anywhere within 50 meters.

23
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,160
Intertwine...

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,040
is the feature of
Controlling Branch’s soul master.

25
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,140
Keep this book.

26
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,510
It’s about my study on the training of soul power.

27
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,650
I heard the apprentice and Boss Xiao
are starting a fight.

28
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,760
Come on!

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,320
Fighting against the wolf’s claws of Boss Xiao?
He’s asking for death.

30
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,390
Blue Silver Plant. Intertwine!

31
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,020
Hello, Mr. Su Yun Tao.

32
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,310
He’s the child I’ve mentioned to you.

33
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,300
Please verify him.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 9]

35
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,250
Here is the lowest-level of Martial Soul Hall.

36
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,500
It’s also known as Martial Soul Branch Hall.

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,410
No matter how small a city is in this land,

38
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,700
there will be a Martial Soul Hall in this size.

39
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,220
In the branch hall, there’s a sub-hall.

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,130
The level higher is Martial Soul Main Hall.

41
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,250
The level of Martial Soul Main Hall...

42
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,290
is only available in big cities.

43
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,390
In the capital of both kingdoms,

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,420
there are the Martial Soul Temples of 4th level

45
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,150
The 5th level is the Sacred Temple.

46
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,540
That’s the holiest place of Martial Soul Hall.

47
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,420
Actually, above the Sacred Temple,

48
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,430
there’s the legendary Soul Land Shrine.

49
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,420
But only soul masters that achieved
the highest soul level...

50
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,120
are qualified to go there.

51
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,300
That’s the dream of every soul master.

52
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,800
Thank you for telling me all these,

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,070
Grandpa Ma Xiu Nuo.

54
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,580
Can we start now?

55
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,340
Nowadays, youngsters are so impatient.

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,290
Okay, we may start now.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,780
This is Blue Silver Plant.

58
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,240
Is there a problem, Grandpa Ma Xiu Nuo?

59
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,330
It’s a century soul ring.

60
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,790
No wonder even the Blue Silver Plant
has such a big change.

61
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,510
It seems like you had a good teacher
in Nuoding School.

62
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,990
Sadly, the Blue Silver Plant
has low potential to develop.

63
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,210
Focus your soul power in it.

64
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,660
Show me which level you’ve achieved.

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,730
Accordingly, you should be 11...

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,270
This is...

67
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,190
Level 13 of soul power.

68
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,600
Level 13 of soul power?

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,070
That isn’t right. How could you skip 2 levels?

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,620
Child, can you tell me...

71
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,510
which soul beast you hunted to get this soul ring?

72
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,970
Datura Snake.

73
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,990
What?

74
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,460
Datura Snake?

75
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,780
Datura Snake from Animal Branch?

76
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,300
How can Plant Branch use soul ring
of Animal Branch?

77
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,220
It’s possible, Grandpa Ma Xiu Nuo.

78
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,690
It can be done under certain circumstances.

79
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,070
My master called it
the Theory of Martial Soul Mimicry.

80
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,460
Who is your master?

81
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,720
Everyone calls him Grandmaster.

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
Grandmaster?

83
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,320
He’s the Grandmaster who came up with
10 Core Competing Power of Martial Soul,

84
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,950
and then was expelled by Martial Soul Hall?

85
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,810
<i>Turns out he was from Martial Soul Hall.</i>

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,850
Tang San, are you willing
to join Martial Soul Hall?

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,610
Grandpa Ma Xiu Nuo, am I not here for registration?

88
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,050
No, this isn’t the same.

89
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,380
Joining Martial Soul Hall...

90
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,700
meaning you’ll be an exclusive
soul master of Martial Soul Hall.

91
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,000
The training of soul masters will
start directly in our special school.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,880
That’s impossible.

93
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,430
I’m already learning in Nuoding School.

94
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,470
It’s indeed too late.

95
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,430
Even if we’re the Martial Soul Hall,

96
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,210
we can’t snatch you from another school.

97
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,350
I’m afraid the Grandmaster wouldn’t agree
with you joining us either.

98
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,430
It’s all Su Yun Tao’s fault.

99
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,200
He should have brought you
to Martial Soul Hall directly.

100
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,350
You can’t say that.

101
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,740
If I were to come here first,

102
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,360
I wouldn’t get such a good soul ring.

103
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,180
That’s right.

104
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,230
Alright. Welcome to the team of soul masters.

105
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,110
From now on,

106
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,070
you’re an honored soul master of Tian Dou Empire.

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,920
Boy, it’s dangerous here. Get out.

108
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,180
Get an adult if you want to buy something.

109
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,770
Hello, Uncle. Do you need an apprentice here?

110
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,250
Stop it. Get off.

111
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,070
Look at you, you don’t look like
a blacksmith at all.

112
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,800
Sorry, Uncle. I’ll be back later.

113
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,120
Uncle, can I be an apprentice now?

114
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,640
Boy, are you making fun of me?

115
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,800
Uncle, I’m an apprentice of Nuoding School.

116
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,790
I have time every afternoon.

117
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,850
My father is a blacksmith.

118
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,320
I have been learning to forge from him.

119
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,390
If you’re willing, you may come.

120
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,350
You may serve as a handyman.

121
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,980
The salary isn’t high.

122
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,990
But you’ll be fed. How about that?

123
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,630
No problem.

124
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,160
Stop staring, start working.
I’ll treat all of you to wine tonight.

125
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Okay. Keep it up, brothers.

126
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,210
You said you had learned to forge
from your father.

127
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,700
What did your father teach you
when you were so young?

128
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,860
Forging, of course.

129
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,260
I might look small.

130
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,030
But I’m strong. Forging isn’t a problem for me.

131
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,660
Brothers.

132
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,340
Our new worked claims he can forge.

133
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,220
Let me try it if you don’t believe it.

134
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,420
What about this?

135
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,850
If you can carry this hammer, I’ll believe you.

136
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,260
[Soul Land]

137
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,100
You’re trying to remove the impurities
of this pig iron, right?

138
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,000
Uncle, please pull the bellows. It’s not hot enough.

139
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,450
Hold on.

140
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,760
If you keep hammering like this,
it wouldn’t be small even after a year.

141
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,070
What should I do then?

142
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,570
Tell me.

143
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,150
Which part of your body do you use
when you wield the hammer?

144
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,920
It should be waist.

145
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,850
From waist to back to move the hand.

146
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,020
Besides the brain,

147
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,590
what’s the most important organ?

148
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,690
Heart.

149
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,630
How many hearts does one have?

150
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,860
Ah?

151
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,980
Answer me.

152
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,230
One.

153
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,180
No, you’re wrong. Not one.

154
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,870
It’s three.

155
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,220
Your calf muscles...

156
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,810
are your second and third hearts.

157
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,400
When one...

158
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,340
wants to release all his power,

159
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,510
all three hearts must be functioning
at the same time.

160
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,840
You shouldn’t start from your waist
when you work hard.

161
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,550
The three hearts should be your starting point.

162
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,140
Start from the hearts,
use your back as an axis. Look.

163
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,810
This is...

164
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,780
Try it.

165
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,280
Dad, did I do it right?

166
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,950
Do you know the function
of the hearts now?

167
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,200
The most used muscle is calf muscles.

168
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,150
Calf muscles are the source of power.

169
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,080
When you use the power of calf muscles well,

170
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,280
your power will be increased.

171
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,380
Here.

172
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,870
Do as I did.

173
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,530
Pay attention to my next action.

174
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,180
<i>Right. It’s taking advantage of another power.</i>

175
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,890
<i>Such a beautiful skill of hammering.</i>

176
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,960
Do you understand now?

177
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Take advantage of another power.
I understand the theory.

178
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,510
But this doesn’t look simple.

179
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,610
If you want to achieve my level,
you have to practice more.

180
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,140
The key is to control your power when you forge.

181
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,970
Carry on practicing.

182
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,360
Don’t increase your power and speed blindly.

183
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,620
Accuracy is also important.

184
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,740
You need to know the aim of your hammer.

185
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,730
<i>Start from the calf muscles, to the heart.</i>

186
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,730
<i>Waist as axis, pass the power up.</i>

187
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,300
Powerful. You’re really the son of a blacksmith.

188
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,590
Could this be...

189
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,830
the Skill of Random Hammering?

190
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,190
The most powerful continuous hammering skill.

191
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,280
What’s that?

192
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,370
Skill of Random Hammering is
a skill of continuous hammering.

193
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,560
Taking advantage of another power.

194
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
It can release the power
of a blacksmith perfectly.

195
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,200
I heard the most powerful one...

196
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
can hammer 81 times continuously.

197
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,740
The pig iron can be hammered
into the desired shape directly.

198
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Skill of Random Hammering is the best
way to remove the impurities of metal.

199
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,560
I thought it’s lost.

200
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,030
<i>[One year later]</i>

201
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,510
Little San.

202
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,360
When will we arrive at your place?

203
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,710
Soon. I’ve told you,

204
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,090
my family is poor. I have nothing to serve you.

205
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,390
It’s okay.

206
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,180
My father has a bad temper.

207
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,890
I’ll be good.

208
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,020
I hope so.

209
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,950
What? You don’t want me to go
to your house?

210
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,220
No, that’s not what I mean.

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,080
Dad, I’m back.

212
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,360
It’s just as messy as before.

213
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,380
Dad, I’m back.

214
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,780
Grandpa Jack.

215
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,180
Little San, why did you come back alone?

216
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,850
I came back with Xiao Wu.

217
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,670
Hello, Grandpa Jack.

218
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,900
Hello.

219
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,880
Grandpa Jack. Where is my father?

220
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,590
I wanted to pick you up
with your father.

221
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,980
He left this.

222
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,120
<i>Little San.</i>

223
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,800
<i>When you read this letter, I’ve gone.</i>

224
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,890
<i>Don’t look for me.
You’ll never be able to find me.</i>

225
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,710
<i>An eagle can only fly high when it’s independent.</i>

226
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,430
<i>I’m useless. I can’t help you.</i>

227
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,910
<i>You have to choose your path.</i>

228
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,800
<i>I have to get back something that belongs to me.</i>

229
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,540
<i>Don’t be worried about me.</i>

230
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,570
<i>One day, we’ll meet again.</i>

231
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,690
<i>You’re as exquisite as your mother.</i>

232
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,820
<i>I believe, you’ll be the pride of your mother.</i>

233
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,120
<i>If one day, you think soul master
isn’t a good occupation,</i>

234
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,670
<i>then go back to Soul Saint Village.</i>

235
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,880
<i>Be like me, be a blacksmith.</i>

236
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,280
<i>Don’t miss me.</i>

237
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,620
<i>Tang Hao.</i>

238
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,120
My father has left.

239
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,520
Thank you, Grandpa Jack.

240
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,710
[Next Episode]
Hurry. Call me Sister Wu.

241
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,080
Hello, Grandmaster.
