I only need this moment of the loophole.

26
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,900
You lost.

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,300
Just wait and see.

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,660
A hidden weapon can only attack secretly.

29
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,960
Combining with poison
can have excellent effects.

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,180
Can I

31
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,580
combine the Blue Silver Plant
and a hidden weapon?

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,100

[Soul Land]
[Episode 82]

34
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,980
These three soul bones are the relics
of the late elders of Martial Soul Hall.

35
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,360
The Pope uses them
as the prize for the champion.

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,980
They must be very confident in the participants.

37
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,840
Do you still feel lucky now?

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,900
Old Freak.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,680
Do you know the level of the participants

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,240
from the Martial Soul Hall?

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,540
What are their Martial Souls?

42
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,120
Little San. You still don’t get it.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,780
You wouldn’t have the chance to win.

44
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,180
A black Decade Millennium Soul Ring?

45
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,000
Now, do you think I can compete
with those from the Martial Soul Hall?

46
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,760
Give up the tournament of this year.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,980
At your age, you can still join
the tournament next year.

48
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,960
At that time, no one can be your rival.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,620
But I have the strength to fight with them.

50
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,140
Do you know how troublesome you will be

51
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,500
if your fourth soul ring is of decade millennium?

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,540
If I’m not wrong,

53
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,280
your information is now on the table of
Platinum Chiefs of Martial Soul Hall.

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,980
They’ll either subdue you

55
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,560
or get rid of you on the field by chance.

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,280
The tournament rules are just a game

57
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,300
to the Martial Soul Hall.

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,040
How can I be eliminated as they wanted?

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,660
Let me tell you.

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,780
The soul powers of participants from
Martial Soul Hall are above Level 45.

61
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,540
One at Level 51, two at Level 52.

62
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,240
They’ve recorded the youngest
in the Martial Soul Hall.

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,160
They’ve also...

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,360
met the age of the participant.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,080
I suggest that you give up.

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,620
At your age,

67
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,920
you still have big chances
to overtake them in the future.

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Old Freak.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,180
If I really drawback, I’ll lose confidence.

70
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,000
Only that I fight with all my strength,

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,860
then I can know the gap between our strengths.

72
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,000
I will not give up.

73
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,340
Fine. Younger generations
will do all right on their own.

74
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,020
Take care.

75
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,700
I’m going.

76
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,420
Who is it?

77
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,820
You want to fight again?

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,680
Xiao Wu, how did you do it?

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,560
Your melee ability seems
to be strengthened a lot.

80
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,440
Soul skill does not necessarily have to
be given by a soul ring.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
We have a lot of potentials.

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,800
It’ll be a kind of soul skill when we develop one.

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,560
It’ll be more practical after understanding it.

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,480
By cooperating with the soul skill,

85
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,140
the overall strength will be
significantly improved.

86
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,360
Xiao Wu. You can actually see it so thoroughly.

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,400
We happen to hold the same view.

88
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,960
That is the direction of Shrek School.

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
What happened?

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
Teacher Er Long is too mean.

91
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,460
You didn’t cooperate well.

92
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,680
You couldn’t even pass three rounds under me.

93
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,600
I wonder when Little San and Xiao Wu are coming back.

94
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
If this continues,

95
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,460
my Evil Eyes White Tiger is
going to be a burnt tiger.

96
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,120
Master and guys, we are back.

97
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,140
It’s good to be back.

98
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,900
These days, your partners have been
practicing with Er Long.

99
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,380
The battle is quite tragic.

100
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,320
You guys must have suffered a lot.

101
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,700
After both of you return,

102
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,160
hopefully, you won’t do worse than them.

103
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Rest assured, Teacher Er Long.

104
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,780
Shrek Seven Devils never fear of difficulties.

105
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,660
Guys, are you ready?

106
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,460
Yes!

107
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,480
Come on, Teacher Er Long!

108
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,600
Teacher Er Long comes from the family of
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.

109
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,179
There’s the thunder property in her Martial Soul.

110
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,959
It’s likely to have a paralytic effect.

111
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,880
Boss Dai. Fatty.

112
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
When you meet head-on later,

113
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,820
don’t go on fighting and retreat quickly.

114
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,540
I will let Xiao Wu and Zhu Qing
distract Teacher Er Long’s attention.

115
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,160
Okay.

116
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Xiao Wu. You cooperate with Zhu Qing.

117
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,940
Entangle Teacher Er Long
according to your melee advantage.

118
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,080
Remember. Teacher Er Long’s
soul power is far too terrifying.

119
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,640
Once the soul power in her body surges,

120
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,820
you must retreat immediately.

121
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,140
Otherwise, there’s no way we can fight back.

122
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,860
In short, as long as you retreat,

123
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,980
just leave the rest to me.

124
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,960
First soul skill, Phoenix Firing Line.

125
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,880
Third soul skill, Furious Fire Shocking Thunder.

126
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,600
Second soul skill,
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

127
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,820
Nine Layers of Colours. Jiubao Amber Pagoda.

128
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,460
Jiubao Boosts! Second, Speed!

129
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,820
Purple Demon Eye!

130
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,600
Third soul skill, Teleport.

131
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,880
Second soul skill, Charm.

132
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,160
Fourth soul skill, Ghost Shadow Doppelganger.

133
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,100
You, little rascals!

134
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,880
Flying Mushroom Sausage!

135
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,440
Fourth soul skill, Blood Eater Flame!

136
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,840
Fifth soul skill!

137
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
Fourth soul skill!

138
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,940
Blue Silver Cage is not going to trap me!

139
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,460
Soaring Flame!

140
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,680
Blue Silver Spike Formation!

141
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,660
[Soul Land]

142
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,840
Teacher Er Long. You’ve lost.

143
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,940
This is...

144
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,580
Is this the result of
Little San’s cultivation these days?

145
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,880
Blue Silver Cage has mutated.

146
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,120
Facing this sudden attack of
Blue Silver Spike Formation,

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,440
even Teacher Er Long has been
caught unprepared.

148
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,960
Little San. How did you do this?

149
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,940
Blue Silver Cage has actually mutated.

150
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,560
Luckily, Xiao Wu helped me.

151
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,500
I have a new level of insight into
the Blue Silver Cage.

152
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,320
Okay, Er Long. You lost.

153
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,140
I don’t accept it. Why did I lose?

154
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,020
I must be the one to win
if we continue to fight.

155
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,880
The Martial Soul Fusion Skill of Mu Bai
and Zhu Qing hasn’t been used yet.

156
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,060
Little San has also retained his Eight Spider Bone.

157
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,240
You still lost.

158
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,140
You were set up.

159
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,700
When you were caught by Little San’s Purple Demon Eye,

160
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,560
you had no chance anymore.

161
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Today, even Frander

162
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,340
couldn’t handle their bombardment.

163
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,580
Fine! How dare you set me up?

164
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,680
I am not Liu Er Long if I don’t beat till you cry!

165
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,700
We still have something to do.

166
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,020
Nothing can be better than
battling against Teacher Er Long.

167
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Do your best, guys!

168
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,420
Er Long. You shall go easy.

169
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,380
It’s indeed the Imperial Hunting Ground.
It’s so stylish.

170
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,040
Sooner or later,

171
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,080
Shrek will also be as stylish as this.

172
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,140
Please show me your card.

173
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,880

174
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,580
I am Luo Ke Sen,

Third Team’s captain of the Imperial Knights.

176
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,960
Please come with me.

177
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,980
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament qualifying rounds

178
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,500
will be held in the camp.

179
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,100
To protect the soul masters’ privacy and safety,

180
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,680
ordinary audiences are not allowed
to watch the game.

181
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,100
Only teams that joined the preliminary
are allowed to watch the game.

182
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,820
To avoid unwanted troubles,

183
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,120
teams entering the qualifying rounds are
arranged to rest in different places.

184
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,620
This is Shrek School’s rest camp.

185
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,680
There won’t be any opening ceremony tomorrow.

186
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,640
Qualifying rounds will start right away.
Please rest early.

187
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
Thank you, General Luo Ke Sen.

188
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,580
No problem. I’ll leave first.

189
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,780
This rest camp looks good.

190
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,140
Hello, Uncle Ning.
Your Highness, why are you here?

191
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,840
Brother Tang. I came to visit you.

192
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,740
How is it? Can you adapt here?

193
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,200
The conditions here are very good.

194
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,020
Thanks for your concern, Your Highness.

195
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,180
Brother Tang.

196
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,560
Don’t call me that anymore.

197
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,020
I’m a few years older than you.

198
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,220
If you don’t mind,

199
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,500
just call me Brother Xue.

200
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,580
Can I just call your name?

201
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,900
Why are you stunned?
Hurry and call Brother Xue.

202
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,940
Okay, Brother Xue.
I’ll call you that in the future.

203
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,840
Where’s Rong Rong?

204
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,820
It’s been a while since I last met her.
I quite miss her.

205
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,960
Dad! Why are you here?

206
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
Hello, Chief Ning.

207
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,860
This is...

208
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,560
He is my disciple, Xue Qing He.

209
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,080
[Next Episode] Everyone, the drawing result
for tomorrow’s game is out.

210
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,520
We come with a bold request.

211
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,720
We from Shrek are ethical and with integrity.

212
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,000
The one smeared the good name
of soul masters is you.

213
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,240
I advise you and your losers
to out of the field as soon as possible.

214
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,120
Don’t you shame our Barak Kingdom.

215
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,740
Frander. You are a coward.

216
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,900
What happened?

217
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,040
Scoundrel.

218
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,960
Master, it’s getting late.
We shall go now.
