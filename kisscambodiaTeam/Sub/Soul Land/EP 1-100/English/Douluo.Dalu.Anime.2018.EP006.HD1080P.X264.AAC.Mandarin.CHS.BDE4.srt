Is this dorm seven?

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,830
Hello, I’m Xiao Wu, the “Wu” from dance.

22
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,700
I want to have a friendly fight with you.

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,690
Are you sure?

24
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,920
<i>Gosh.</i>

25
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,840
Little San, your bedding is huge. Let’s share it.

26
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,190
Together?

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,140
Many think that the Blue Silver Plant is useless.

28
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,120
But after years of research,

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,320
Blue Silver Plant has its strength too.

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,530
First, it consumes little soul power.

31
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,650
Second, it is commonly found and deceitful.

32
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,040
Third, it has various development paths.

33
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,230
It doesn’t repel the soul ring easily.

34
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,550
Repel?

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,180
[Soul Land]
[Episode 6]

36
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,630
That’s right.

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,070
If your Martial Soul
doesn’t match with the soul ring,

38
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,750
Adding the soul ring
on the Martial Soul...

39
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,670
will result in a repulsion.

40
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,750
And the fourth benefit

41
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,630
only works on you.

42
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,150
Me?

43
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,580
Yes.

44
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,190
The soul masters who own the Blue Silver Plant...

45
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,950
has too little soul power when they’re awakened.

46
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,730
That’s why they’re progressing slowly.

47
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,510
There’s never been a powerful
Blue Silver Plant master in Soul Land.

48
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,800
But you’re different.

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,050
You are born with full soul power.

50
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,290
This is what people are lacking.

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,270
To conclude,

52
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,640
I suggest that you go to the Controlling Branch.

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,010
Controlling Branch?

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,230
Controlling Branch uses
Martial Soul to restrain the opponent.

55
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,150
And gain control of the situation.

56
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,140
Right,

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,080
after thorough research,

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,220
the Blue Silver Plant Martial Soul
can change its form freely.

59
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,630
No doubt it is perfect for Controlling Branch.

60
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,540
But the Blue Silver Plant breaks easily.

61
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,250
How can it tie people up?

62
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,170
That’s your development path.

63
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,460
Your soul ring should focus on two areas.

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,710
Firstly, its tenacity and the other one is poison.

65
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,370
As your soul power elevates,

66
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,400
your Martial Soul will be more powerful too.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,390
After you channels in more
soul power into the Blue Silver Plant,

68
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,630
naturally, it will become tougher.

69
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,910
In addition to the supporting effects
of the soul ring,

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,480
It’s easy to tie up the enemy.

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,710
Whereas the poison will restrain the enemy.

72
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,100
A combination like this

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,470
is enough to attack the enemy.

74
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,210
<i>That means from now on
I must use the hidden weapon</i>

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,260
<i>on a fixed target.</i>

76
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,710
That’s all for now.

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,780
Alright.

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,050
You may go back first.

79
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,300
I’ll pick you up tomorrow morning.

80
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:06,870
Okay.

81
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,490
Master.

82
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,260
The school has just started
yet you’re leaving?

83
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,730
What about the apprentice’s job?

84
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,280
If you leave, I’ll have to do the work alone.

85
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,570
You’ll have to work harder for these few days.

86
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,750
After I’m back,

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,150
I’ll settle the work for the rest of the semester.

88
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,710
You’ll still get the wages.

89
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,360
How is it?

90
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,330
Well,

91
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,910
I’ll accept this then.

92
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,010
Okay,

93
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,010
it’s a deal.

94
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,220
Let’s go back.

95
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,480
But,

96
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,320
I still want to fight with you.

97
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,120
Fight again?

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,170
That’s right.

99
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,840
I hit you first.

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,820
It’s considered as a sneak attack.

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,340
It’s unfair even if I win over you.

102
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,500
And you were not satisfied with the result.

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,950
I’ll give you another chance.

104
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,910
Come on, then.

105
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,030
Don’t cry if I hit you later.

106
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,220
Are you ready?

107
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,830
Come on.

108
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,680
What are you doing?

109
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,050
Isn’t this a friendly fight?

110
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,180
Yes.

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,730
I’m coming to you.

112
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,010
How about it?

113
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,370
Convinced or not?

114
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,020
Not convinced. Try again.

115
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,010
Try again?

116
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,690
I won’t give you an opportunity.

117
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,850
If you have any skills,

118
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,890
then struggle free.

119
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,930
What are you doing?

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,930
In a public place?

121
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,530
Get off!

122
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,650
You two...

123
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,170
What do you have to say?

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,020
Teacher.

125
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,290
- We were having a friendly fight...
- Please let me explain...

126
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,200
Friendly fight?

127
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,850
Friendly fight by lying on the ground

128
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,730
and learning how to flirt at a young age.

129
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,170
What about when you’re grown up?

130
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Teacher.

131
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,270
If you don’t believe me,

132
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,490
I’ll have a friendly fight with you too.

133
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,210
Teacher.

134
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,610
Are you okay?

135
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,250
What was your technique just now?

136
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,130
It seems pretty awesome.

137
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,610
That’s my favorite technique.

138
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,570
It’s called Rabbit Kicking Eagle.

139
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,090
Rabbit Kicking Eagle.

140
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,650
I did not use my hand.

141
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,010
Otherwise, the result will be more serious.

142
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,010
Why are you asking so clearly?

143
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,810
Thinking about a counter measure?

144
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,330
You are gauging the heart of a gentleman.

145
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,570
Dare you say I’m a base person?

146
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,290
I’ve found out the way to fight you.

147
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,160
Speaking of speed, I’m not afraid of you.

148
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,830
Hey, you’re cheating.

149
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,710
We’re having a friendly fight, not hide-and-seek.

150
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,750
You can’t just dodge around!

151
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,750
You can attack me if you want.

152
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,830
Okay, be careful.

153
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,830
Hit your left shoulder.

154
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,190
Hit your right shoulder.

155
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,030
<i>This rascal is bluffing me.</i>

156
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,270
Left leg, right leg.

157
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,670
Hey, how dare you to hit me with rocks?

158
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,310
Is using rocks not allowed?

159
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,110
No, this doesn’t count.

160
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,670
This time, you lose.

161
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,550
Again.

162
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,070
Again? Okay then.

163
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,950
Again.

164
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,390
Master, where are we going to find the soul beast?

165
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,390
Why are you so tired? Are you sick?

166
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,470
Maybe I didn’t rest well yesterday.

167
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,350
It’s okay.

168
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,830
Please continue on
the information about soul beast.

169
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,310
Okay, listen carefully.

170
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,790
Normally, soul beast is divided into five levels.

171
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,790
Decade Soul Beast, Century Soul Beast,
Millennium Soul Beast...

172
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,390
Decade Millennium Soul Beast and
Century Millennium Soul Beast.

173
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,790
Each of them corresponds to
white, yellow, purple, black, red,

174
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,710
the five colours of the soul ring.

175
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,350
The longer the soul beast
has been practicing, the stronger it is,

176
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,390
and the soul ring that it produces will be better.

177
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,910
Soul Hunting Forest at
the north side of Nuoding City.

178
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,270
That is where the royals rear their soul beast.

179
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,190
Decade or Century Soul Beast
are mostly found there.

180
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,310
It’s rare to find any soul beast
above the Millennium Soul Beast.

181
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,310
But judging from your current situation,

182
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,230
Decade or Century Soul Beast will be enough.

183
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,910
Master, how is the soul ring powerful?

184
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,750
This is a good question.

185
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,110
Soul ring not only can add into
the soul master’s characteristic,

186
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,590
it can also add special skills on the soul master.

187
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,470
For instance,

188
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,710
if you get a matching Decade Soul Ring.

189
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,110
Your control on
Blue Silver Plant will increase by ten.

190
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,150
If Century Soul Ring,
your control will increase by hundred.

191
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,220
The add on skills for Century Soul Ring...

192
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,340
is normally stronger than Decade Soul Ring.

193
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,030
That means powerful nobles can use their
family’s power to hunt strong beasts?

194
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,230
Great. It seems that
you’ve thought about this.

195
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,870
The nobles have advantages
on hunting soul beasts.

196
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,870
But the soul ring’s adding terms are strict.

197
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,070
First, the soul ring exists shortly
after the soul beast dies.

198
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,310
The soul ring created will only be
gained by the soul master who killed it.

199
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,110
Besides, soul beasts are prideful.

200
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,390
They won’t allow themselves to be held captives.

201
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,430
If they are seriously injured,

202
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,030
they’ll self detonate so that the
soul master can’t get their soul rings.

203
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,350
Moreover,

204
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,070
soul masters must persevere
while absorbing the soul ring.

205
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,950
Or else, they’ll be unable to withstand
the power of the soul ring and explode.

206
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,630
I got it.

207
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,310
Little San, this world is fair. This is for you.

208
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,510
Thank you, Master.

209
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,870
Youngster shall not refuse gifts from an elder.

210
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,150
Good, this belt has been with me for thirty years.

211
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,870
It hasn’t also been used for thirty years.

212
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,870
Hopefully in the future,
it can be useful as it should in your hands.

213
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,790
Master, what is this belt for?

214
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,030
It is a soul guiding tool for storage.

215
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,910
Every piece of jade can provide
a storage space of a cubic meter.

216
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,070
To use it, channels your soul power into it.

217
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,070
<i>Each piece of jade has
one cubic meter of storage space.</i>

218
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,910
<i>Twenty-four cubic meters in total.</i>

219
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,750
<i>The storage for hidden weapons is settled.</i>

220
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,590
This belt has been with me for thirty years,
yet I’ve never named it.

221
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,830
You should name it.

222
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,430
I’ll name it as
Twenty-Four Moonlight Bridges.

223
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,710
It’s a nice name, but a bit too lengthy.

224
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,750
<i>Considered it as a memory from Tang Clan.</i>

225
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,630
[Soul Land]

226
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,710
I have the token!
A team to hunt for strength type soul beast.

227
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,710
We still need two more persons.

228
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,510
Hunt for agility type soul beast.

229
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,110
Token for seven. Ten gold soul coins.

230
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,630
Master, why is here so busy?

231
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,590
These are due to benefits.

232
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,790
Soul masters are rich.

233
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,590
These people are here to earn their money.

234
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,950
What about those who are calling for a team?

235
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,870
You have to kill the soul beast
to absorb the soul ring.

236
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,510
But some powerful soul beasts
are not easy to hunt.

237
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,590
Thus they need to form a team and work together.

238
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,950
But a temporarily formed team like this...

239
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,470
can’t be considered as a real team.

240
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,590
A truly superior hunting team...

241
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,270
needs to form by five parts.

242
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,870
Food Branch tool soul master
is in charge of replenishment.

243
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,070
Healing Branch tool soul master on
condition’s and soul power’s recovery.

244
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,430
Agility Branch war
soul master on the investigation.

245
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,790
Strength Branch war soul master on defence.

246
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,630
Attack Branch war soul master
on killing the opponent.

247
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,310
A team with these five factors...

248
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,070
is a team that is considered complete.

249
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,030
Besides, teamwork...

250
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,510
can’t be formed in a few days.

251
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,990
More importantly,

252
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,470
the teammates in the same team,

253
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,950
must trust each other.

254
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,870
Otherwise, when encountering danger,

255
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,030
the team will fall into pieces easily.

256
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,350
Trust?

257
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,860
Maybe you’ll join such a team in the future.

258
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,990
While choosing a team,

259
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,590
you can even not
considering your teammate’s ability.

260
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,070
But you need to keep this in mind.

261
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,670
The team that you choose

262
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,390
is a team that you can entrust your back with.

263
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,670
Soul Hunting Forest is not for anyone to enter.

264
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,470
Only soul masters with
token issued from Martial Soul Hall...

265
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,510
are allowed to enter the forest
to hunt for soul beasts.

266
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,950
These soldiers are
just defensing on the outer area.

267
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,110
In the Soul Hunting Forest,

268
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,990
law enforcement officials
from Martial Soul Hall

269
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,060
will check the token at any time.

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,690
They are merciless.

271
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,150
Master,

272
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,260
the Soul Hunting Forest is
owned by Martial Soul Hall or the country?

273
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,030
Don’t ask a question like this in public.

274
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,470
The relations between
Martial Soul Hall and the country,

275
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,070
I’ll tell you later.

276
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,390
It isn’t hard to get the token.

277
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,390
First, you need approval from Martial Soul Hall.

278
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,590
To confirm that your skills
has reach a certain peak of a level.

279
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,230
And you need a soul ring to level up.

280
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,990
Next, you need at least
three nobles to vouch for you.

281
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,910
Remember this logo.

282
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,070
This is the logo of Martial Soul Hall.

283
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,550
There are six types of the logo in Martial Soul Hall.

284
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,830
You need to differentiate
the token by its pattern.

285
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,550
The lowest ranking token has a sword on it.

286
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,030
It symbolises a late chief executive
officer of Martial Soul Hall’s temple.

287
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,350
The token with a rank higher
has a hammer beside the sword.

288
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,110
It symbolizes an extremely powerful elder
of Martial Soul Hall in the past.

289
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,790
Master.

290
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,470
These two persons must have
important positions in Martial Soul Hall.

291
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,590
I heard that beast soul
is stronger than tool soul.

292
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,510
But both of them are tool souls, right?

293
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,550
Those who said that
beast soul is stronger than tool soul,

294
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,350
apparently have little
understanding about Martial Soul.

295
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,350
The strength of a Martial Soul
depends on two things.

296
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,710
First, it’s the soul power
when the Martial Soul’s awaken.

297
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,790
Another one is hard practice.

298
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,990
True strength depends on own’s practice.

299
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,030
Let’s go.

300
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,830
<i>True strength depends on own’s practice.</i>

301
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,990
This token,

302
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,350
is Martial Soul Hall’s third-ranking warrant.

303
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,830
It can be owned forever.

304
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,230
Unlike the two previous tokens,

305
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,110
they need to be returned to
the Martial Soul Hall after the hunt.

306
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,350
With this,

307
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,820
you can enter any forest
without Decade Millennium Soul Beast

308
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,340
in Tian Dou.

309
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,910
Compared with the two other tokens,

310
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,790
my token has a Blue Lightning T-Rex on it.

311
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,110
It is considered as
a top creature among the beast souls.

312
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,470
Although its master is
not from Martial Soul Hall,

313
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,350
the family it’s representing is
respected by Martial Soul Hall.

314
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,830
There are three higher ranking tokens.

315
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,830
Each has an additional logo, right?

316
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,110
That’s right.

317
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,750
Six logos of Martial Souls.

318
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,430
Each represents six powerful soul masters.

319
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,190
It also represents six powerful families.

320
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,710
Three of them are in Tian Dou Empire.

321
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,910
Another three are in Xing Luo Empire.

322
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,350
Master, the soul masters
represented in the tokens,

323
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,710
what are their titles?

324
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,510
Soul Saint, Great Soul Land Master,
or Grand Soul Land Master?

325
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,270
Grand Soul Land Master.

326
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,830
The six most powerful
Grand Soul Land Masters.

327
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,190
Most powerful?

328
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,470
Same level, different soul rings,
different Martial Souls.

329
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,870
Their strengths are totally different.

330
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,830
These six Grand Soul Land Masters
are the best of the best.

331
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,070
Even there are other soul masters
who reach above Level 90,

332
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,230
and enter the Grand Soul Land Master level,

333
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,710
their status remains unchanged.

334
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,550
But, this is still too distant for you.

335
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,030
Okay, we’re going to enter the forest.

336
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,070
From now on,

337
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,070
don’t leave my side, not even a single step.

338
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,030
Okay.

339
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,470
[Next Episode] It’s the scariest
among all poison soul beasts.

340
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,030
And it is extremely fast.

341
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,830
Come on, my first soul ring.

342
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,030
Farting like thunder. Blasting Luo San Pao!
