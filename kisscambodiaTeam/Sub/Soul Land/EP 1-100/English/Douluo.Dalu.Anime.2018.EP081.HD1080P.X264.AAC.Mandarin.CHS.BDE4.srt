Failure is the mother of success.

Little San, don’t be sad.

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,750
It is a pride of our Shrek School.

27
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,990
Due to my carelessness,

28
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,830

Even if your Serpent Venom became stronger,

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,550
how could you surpass the oppression of

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,630
three-level soul power?

36
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,670
I am...

37
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,710
The Grand Soul Land Master at Level 95.

38
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,530
<i>Ju Hua Guan is at Level 95.</i>

39
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,510
<i>I’m only at Level 92.</i>

40
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,810
<i>Once a soul master reaches Level 90,</i>

41
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,750
<i>every level will be vastly different.</i>

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,870
<i>Not to mention three levels.</i>

43
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,650
Hidden weapons.

44
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,810
I still have hidden weapons.

45
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,410
<i>However, a hidden weapon is still a hidden weapon.</i>

46
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,090
<i>When I meet a powerful opponent,
I can’t counteract with it.</i>

48
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,050
<i>Even the most deadly poison,</i>

49
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,730
<i>I just have to pull away.</i>

<i>What?</i>

51
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,130
<i>It’s Medusa Gaze!</i>

<i>Medusa Gaze can never stop my action!</i>

53
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,090
<i>I only need this moment of the loophole.</i>

How dare you make a sneak attack?

58
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,750
It’s so mean.

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,770
You lost.

60
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,190

<i>Thanks to Little Freak’s

66
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,770
Old Freak?

67
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,090
What happened?

68
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,730
Little Freak. What happened?

69
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,730
What exactly happened?

70
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,870
Old Freak. If the soul power of
my peers and me

71
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,110
are above Level 70,

72
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,190
would I still get ahead before them like now?

73
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,070
Why do you ask so?

74
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,130
I don’t know what I should do.

75
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,290
As the level increases,

76
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,670
the weakness of Blue Silver Plant
is getting more obvious.

77
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,490
I think you already knew
my second Martial soul, Hao Tian Hammer.

78
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,790
I just need to match the right soul ring.

79
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,810
It’s more powerful than Blue Silver Plant.

80
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,110
Follow me.

81
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,450
Old Freak. Where are you taking me?

82
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,890
You’ll know it later.

83
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,750
Come on. Release your Blue Silver Plant.

84
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,850
<i>What does Old Freak want to do?</i>

85
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,950
This is an ordinary Blue Silver Plant.

86
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,690
Try touching it.

87
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,930
Tell me what’s the difference.

88
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,930
Comparing with a normal Blue Silver Plant,

89
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,670
my Blue Silver Plant is stronger.

90
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,990
Its top part is more aggressive.
Moreover...

91
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,090
What is it?

92
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,370
Moreover, I think they’re warmer.

93
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,890
To an ordinary person,

94
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,030
having a Blue Silver Plant as Martial Soul

95
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,310
is no way for cultivation.

96
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,150
You not only could cultivate,

97
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,770
you also have innate full soul power.

98
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,790
The most unbelievable thing is that

99
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,950
you actually have Twin Martial Souls.

100
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,870
Master said it before.

101
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,310
Martial Soul inheritance is about
choosing the stronger one among parents.

102
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,070
However, Hao Tian Hammer is more powerful
than Blue Silver Plant.

103
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,070
Why do I...

104
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,070
I accidentally saw it in an ancient book.

105
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,850
There are two conditions for
the birth of Twin Martial Souls.

106
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,510
First.

107
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,710
There’s a big difference in nature of
Martial Soul between the parents.

108
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,610
Second.

109
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,470
The nature of Martial Souls of parents
is very similar.

110
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,630
That means

111
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,870
your mother’s Martial Soul, Blue Silver Plant

112
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,610
is quite similar to the nature of
Martial Soul of your father.

113
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,710
Little San.

114
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,310
Mother. Blue Silver Plant.

115
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,750
Do you still think that
your Blue Silver Plant

116
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,070
is just an ordinary one?

117
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,090
I got it. Thank you, Old Freak.

118
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,490
Rest assured. Based on your
current cultivation speed,

119
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,010
you’ll break your father’s record to
be the youngest Grand Soul Land Master.

120
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,050
The Grand Soul Land Master.

121
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,270
I have decided.

122
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,030
I will never give up on cultivating
the Blue Silver Plant.

123
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,970
It’s good that you understand this.

Congratulations, Xiao Wu.

<i>Everyone’s cultivation has
made progress recently.</i>

129
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,590
<i>I’ve also reached Level 39.</i>

130
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,150
<i>I wonder how about Brother’s cultivation.</i>

131
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,670
Even the best blacksmith in Tian Dou City

132
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,810
couldn’t beat you, Little Freak.

133
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,250
Oh, right. Little Freak.

134
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,130
Do you still have the Cluster Soul
Chasing Life Taking Balls with you?

135
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,130
I gave you two last time.

136
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,830
Have you used them?

137
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,050
I fought with an old man.

138
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,410
This thing is quite useful.

139
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,950
I used to be beaten up by him.

140
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,870
Finally, he was ashamed this time.

141
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,510
Is he the Grand Soul Land Master too?

142
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,510
But the Cluster Soul Chasing
Life Taking Balls is not that toxic.

143
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,370
How did you defeat him?

144
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,410
Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom.

145
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,290
How’s it? Do you get it, Little Freak?

146
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,390
A hidden weapon can only attack secretly.

147
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,130
Combining with poison
can have excellent effects.

148
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,690
Old Freak, as the Grand Venom Master,

149
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,290
when you use a hidden weapon,

150
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,010
you also use the soul skill and soul
power of your Grand Master level,

151
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,530
the effect would be a big difference

152
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,210
compare with only using
a normal hidden weapon.

153
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,250
Can I

154
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,750
combine the Blue Silver Plant
and a hidden weapon?

155
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,670
I know how I should cultivate
the Blue Silver Plant.

156
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,930
Thank you, Old Freak.

157
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,750
Finally, I know what I should do.

158
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,290
It’s getting late.

159
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,010
Let’s go. Let’s have a walk around.

160
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,210
That’s it for today’s practise.

161
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,570
Everyone has improved a lot.

162
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,990
Go back and rest well today.

163
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,090
The practise for tomorrow will be very tough.

164
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,710
I wonder what we will face tomorrow.

165
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,170
As long as we don’t have to battle with Teacher Zhao.

166
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,590
Little San is not around.
It’s tough for us this time.

167
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,010
I mean

168
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,570
Little San’s cultivation will make a breakthrough.

169
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,130
Xiao Wu, since you’re so worried about Brother San,

170
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,450
why don’t you go and see him?

171
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,390
This is the Martial Soul Branch Hall of
Tian Dou City.

172
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,290
How do you think about it?

173
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,730
A branch hall built in the capital of
Tian Dou Empire.

174
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,390
It’s just a branch hall,

175
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,450
yet the momentum is superior to
the power of the Tian Dou Empire.

176
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,310
So its strength is unfathomable.

177
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,830
The strength of Martial Soul Hall

178
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:31,490
can even control lives in the
Advanced Soul Master School Elite Tournament.

179
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,430
Old Freak. Why did you say that?

180
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,230
I heard that you also joined the
Advanced Soul Master School Elite Tournament?

181
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,510
How are the results?

182
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,410
We’ve passed the preliminary.

183
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,170
We’re going to fight in the qualifying rounds.

184
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,450
Having you, Little Freak,

185
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,030
it shouldn’t be a problem
for Shrek to get the third place.

186
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,070
The third place?
You’ve no confidence in me.

187
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,790
Shouldn’t you wish us
to get the first place?

188
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,270
It’s not that I have no confidence in you.

189
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,150
Instead, you have no chance at all.

190
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,750
Because there’s always
the only champion of this tournament.

191
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,950
Who?

192
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,470
Martial Soul Hall.

193
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,670
Why?

194
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,130
The strength of Martial Soul Hall
is all over the land.

195
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,010
They predominate most of the masters.

196
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,350
The person who battled with me

197
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,910
was one of them.

198
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,810
It’s said that they have
some amazing juniors in recent years.

199
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,710
Even the Pope called them as

200
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,470
the Golden Generation of Martial Soul Hall.

201
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,790
That means

202
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,850
Martial Soul Hall is bound to win

203
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,090
the champion of this tournament.

204
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:42,470
Do you know the prize for the champion of
Advanced Soul Master School Elite Tournament?

205
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,730
Why don’t you guess

206
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,050
the most important thing for a soul master?

207
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,450
Could it be a soul bone?

208
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,610
It’s three soul bones.

209
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,750
Three soul bones?

210
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,610
<i>Tang San.</i>

211
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:20,780
<i>He reached Level 40 earlier than the
Golden Generation of Martial Soul Hall.</i>

212
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,860
<i>Blue Silver Plant? Useless Martial Soul.</i>

213
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,630
<i>It’s interesting.</i>

214
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,250
<i>Tang San’s soul power improvement is too fast.</i>

215
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,290
I heard that

216
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:49,710
Dugu Bo is a guest teacher of
a soul master’s school in Tian Dou City.

217
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,870
[Next Episode]
Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

218
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,730
What happened?

219
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,830
Boss Dai. Fatty.

220
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,170
Is this the result of
Little San’s cultivation these days?

221
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,010
How can I be eliminated as they wanted?

222
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,890
Who is it?

223
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,790
Fine! How dare you scheme me?

224
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,170
I am not Liu Er Long
if I don’t beat till you cry!

225
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,610
You wouldn’t have the chance to win.

226
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,050
But I have the strength to fight with them.

227
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,350
Guys, are you ready?
