She’s Liu Er Long.

21
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,320
She’s the one who followed Master and me

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
wandering around the soul masters’ world.

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,820
She’s the third in the Golden Iron Triangle.

24
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,480
I don’t care about the secular viewpoint.

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,780
I just wish to be with you.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 48]

27
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,100
<i>My Xuan Tian Strike is at Level 4,
I’m immune to frost and heat.</i>

28
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,400
<i>Could this freezing feeling be...</i>

29
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,740
Who is it?

30
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,000
That’s bad, Little San might be in trouble.
Hurry and have a look.

31
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,340
Stop pretending if you’re awake.

32
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,000
Kid, you’re Tang San?

33
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Yes, I am.

34
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,480
I heard that you broke
my granddaughter’s third soul skill

35
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,900
and even suppressed it with poison.

36
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,280
How did you cure the venom?

37
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,280
I believe there’s something
else other than liquor.

38
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,000
How dare you call yourself the Grand Venom Master

39
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,360
if you don’t know realgar powder
can cure snake venom?

40
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,620
It has been years since
someone talked to me that way.

41
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
Kid, you’re bold!

42
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,200
How dare you suspect my poison?

43
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,880
Your poison is mere rubbish.

44
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,400
Your poison is indeed effective,
but still it’s useless.

45
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
Poison strike is to attack others.

46
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,320
Now that you’re poisoned too,

47
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,980
what are you if you aren’t useless?

48
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,060
You mean I was poisoned by myself?

49
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,340
I’m 78 years old.

50
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,480
Only I can cast poison to others,

51
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,820
never at once I have been poisoned.

52
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,320
Is that true?

53
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,460
Tell me, when it’s cloudy or raining,

54
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,720
do you ribs feel numb?

55
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,260
It happens once at noon and 11 p.m..

56
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,860
From what I see,

57
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,440
every time it’ll last for at least two hours.

58
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,300
Besides, during midnight,

59
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,720
your head and feet

60
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
will have prickling pain, right?

61
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,300
That overwhelming pain,

62
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,940
you won’t feel that if you aren’t poisoned.

63
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,080
Not only you’re poisoned,

64
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,960
the venom has also entered your marrow.

65
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,400
<i>Blue Silver Plant’s first soul skill, Intertwine.</i>

66
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,660
<i>An attached soul bone?
No wonder Yan lost.</i>

67
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,840
<i>I didn’t expect that</i>

68
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,500
<i>I’d be killed by someone who uses useless poison.</i>

69
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,880
<i>It’s so unworthy.</i>

70
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,660
Not reconciled?

71
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,060
Didn’t you say that my poison is useless?

72
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,020
Yet you’re still defeated by me.

73
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,840
That’s my biggest regret!

74
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,320
If I was given time,
even if I won’t use Martial Soul,

75
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
I’ll kill you too.

76
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,900
Your poison

77
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,460
not only harms yourself,
but also ruins your descendants.

78
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,060
You’re an ultimate rubbish!

79
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,960
What did you say?

80
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,640
You know exactly what I mean.

81
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,320
You can cure my poison?

82
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
I won’t even if I can.

83
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,720
You’ll only suffer more than I do.

84
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,460
Just kill me. Maybe you’re not afraid of death,

85
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,480
but your dearest pretty granddaughter

86
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,220
may won’t hold as long as you.

87
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,740
She’ll only be severer when the poison attacks.

88
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,460
Since she was in her mother’s womb,

89
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,680
she already got in touch with the poison.

90
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,240
<i>Dugu Yan’s unique semblance
and her Jade Phosphor Serpent Venom</i>

91
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,660
<i>must be inherited from Dugu Bo’s Martial Soul.</i>

92
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,920
<i>Even she has a great ability to poison,</i>

93
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,740
<i>at the same time, she inherits
the counter charge of her own poison.</i>

94
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,760
Why should I believe that

95
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
you can cure my poison?

96
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,620
Do I even have to prove it to you?

97
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,200
You’re killing me anyway.

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,160
Having you alive is a threat to the world.

99
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,540
Saving you is just like holding
the candle to the devil.

100
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,960
<i>I’ve been living with poison all my life,</i>

101
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,960
<i>yet I can’t even cure the poison within my body.</i>

102
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,120
<i>But my granddaughter...</i>

103
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,820
Alright, if you can cure our poison,

104
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,080
I won’t kill you,

105
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,540
and I can promise to help you with three things

106
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,880
that don’t violate my base line.

107
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,020
You’re not killing me?
Why should I believe you?

108
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,040
People like you

109
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,460
always repay kindness with ingratitude.

110
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,380
Isn’t my fame enough to prove it?

111
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,980
Stop making empty promises,
unless you make a vow.

112
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,520
Alright then.

113
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,020
As long as you can prove that
you can cure my poison,

114
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,700
I can make a promise.

115
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,760
How do you want me to prove it?

116
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,300
Prove that you can cast poison better than I do,

117
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,220
then I’ll believe you.

118
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,880
I have nothing with me now,

119
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,020
how do I prove I’m stronger than you?

120
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,740
Easy. This is my house.

121
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,220
All herbs are widely grown here.

122
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
I’ll give you one day

123
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,780
to figure out all sorts of antidotes yourself.

124
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,900
After that, I’ll cast three types of poison on you.

125
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,400
If you can cure my poisons with your antidotes,

126
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,660
that means you’re qualified.

127
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,680
Or else, you will die.

128
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
Bring me to your herb garden.

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,760
Don’t disturb me for a day.

130
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,410
[Soul Land]

131
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,420
<i>I can smell sulphur.</i>

132
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,080
Is there a hot spring here?

133
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,300
Your herb garden is near a hot spring?

134
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,440
It’s a great place.

135
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>The hot spring itself
isn’t suitable for plant nourishment,</i>

136
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,680
<i>but some special plants are different.</i>

137
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,300
<i>They need minerals and heat
from a hot spring.</i>

138
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,820
Follow me.

139
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,400
Kid, aren’t you arrogant?

140
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Let me see how you get down.

141
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,740
<i>That’s how he uses attached soul bone.</i>

142
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,560
This is

143
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,580
Ice Fire Spring Mouth.

144
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,100
<i>Both ice and fire which restrict
each other in one spring mouth.</i>

145
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,240
<i>It’s one of the Three Treasures
of hidden weapons in Xuan Tian Records.</i>

146
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,060
<i>I can’t believe the rare
Ice Fire Mouth Spring appears here.</i>

147
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,280
<i>No wonder this old creature can still survive</i>

148
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,160
<i>even he’s severely poisoned.</i>

149
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,680
<i>He even trains himself to
the Grand Soul Land Master.</i>

150
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,040
Ice Fire Mouth Spring?
What are you talking about?

151
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,560
Nothing.

152
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,300
I just didn’t expect such a great place exists.

153
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,260
If I was 30% confident to cure your poison,

154
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,940
now, with this Ice Fire Mouth Spring,

155
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,400
it can be raised to 50%.

156
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,720
What? Only 50%?

157
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,760
Kid, you’ve been lying to me all this while?

158
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,380
You’ve been soaked with poison for years,

159
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,920
50% is already my best to cure you.

160
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,180
But, even if you’re not fully recovered,

161
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,160
it’ll ease your pain too.

162
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,920
But I’m positive to cure your granddaughter.

163
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,540
All my herbs are planted here,

164
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,140
you may use them.

165
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,280
If you dare to ruin my place,

166
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,380
I’ll make sure you go through living hell.

167
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,620
I’ll give you more time.

168
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,880
If you can’t pass my test
the morning after tomorrow,

169
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,780
it’ll be your doomsday.

170
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,640
This is a famous soul beast forest.

171
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,280
Except this mountain is being
sealed by my poison formation

172
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,360
and the soul beasts dare not enter,

173
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,700
Millennium Soul Beasts are out there.

174
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,300
If you run away, before I find you,

175
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,460
the soul beasts will tear you apart.

176
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,520
Kid, remember, don’t touch those two hot springs.

177
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,960
Even I can’t withstand the heat
and frost for too long.

178
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,080
No one can save you by then.

179
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,180
<i>Of course, I’m aware of it.</i>

180
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,300
<i>That’s the coldest and hottest place in the world.</i>

181
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,980
<i>Humans or beasts</i>

182
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,020
<i>who stay by the Ice Fire Eyes</i>

183
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,420
<i>will be hurt by the extreme
heaven and earth auras in a short time.</i>

184
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,800
<i>Their bodies will explode
if they don’t leave immediately.</i>

185
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,180
<i>But, for someone who is poisoned like Dugu Bo</i>

186
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
<i>this is the greatest place.</i>

187
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,080
<i>Extreme frost or heat
is effective against the venom.</i>

188
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,660
<i>Not to mention this treasured place
of Ice Fire Spring Mouth,</i>

189
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,360
<i>there’s no sense of temperature
on the surface of the hot spring.</i>

190
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,420
Is this snow silkworm?

191
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,300
It’s the ultimate herb of
the winter worm and summer grass.

192
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,360
The Vermillion Lotus can grow up to this size?

193
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,020
This is

194
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,740
the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower?

195
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,920
That’s right, that’s it.

196
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,140
It’s the best antidote recorded in the
secret list of the Xuan Tian Records.

197
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,950
Within its range,

198
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,450
none of the poison is effective.

199
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,730
Its fragrance can
neutralize all sorts of poison,

200
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,960
too bad it can’t cure it.

201
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,840
Whether Dugu Bo keeps his promise,

202
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,760
I have to hedge my bet.

203
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,640
Octa Dark Frost, a unique winter flower.

204
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,660
[Next Episode]

205
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,020
Two Saints of Soul above Level 70.

206
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,160
and a soul master under Level 30.

207
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,940
You’ll regret killing Tang San.

208
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,180
Even though three of you are weak,

209
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,420
but I still can take it as warming up.

210
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,680
Sun Moon Golden Shine.

211
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,580
There’s even a trinity Martial Soul Fusion Skill?
