Or else the opponent will either die

182
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,730
or be severely injured.

183
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,410
Her thorns have blocked her retreat.

184
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,690
She trapped herself.

185
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,730
Six wins in a row.

186
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,690
Shrek School has again recorded six wins in a row.

187
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,330
School of Florals has one last member.

188
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,250
Can she stop Shrek School?

189
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,090
Fortunately, she’s just unconscious.

190
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,610
But his soul skill’s power is
greater than this for sure.

191
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,530
Last round,

192
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,730
we admit our defeat.

193
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,570
School of Florals has given up
for the last round.

194
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,130
The winner of this qualifying round is

195
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,570
Shrek School.

196
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,250
They’ve won seven times in a row.

197
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,050
Fatty,

198
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,530
well done!

199
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,890
Of course, Boss Dai.

200
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,250
It is enjoyable to win seven times in a row.

201
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,610
Okay,

202
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,690
we can leave now.

203
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,130
Tang San.

204
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,290
Miss Huo Wu,

205
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,290
what’s up?

206
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,890
Tang San,

207
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,090
I would like to talk to you.

208
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,290
Can’t you say it here?

209
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,130
I want to talk

210
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,890
to you in private.

211
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,210
Go,

212
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,770
you can go back later.

213
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,370
Grandmaster,

214
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,250
didn’t she hurt Tang San enough?

215
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,450
Child,

216
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,690
trust

217
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,170
is the foundation of a relationship.

218
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,690
You must believe...

219
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,450
what is yours,

220
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,690
will always be yours.

221
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,330
Today, Huo Wu spoke to me again.

222
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,730
<i>Tang San.</i>

223
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,290
<i>Why is Huo Wu with him?</i>

224
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,010
Are you okay now?

225
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,770
I’ve recovered.

226
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,090
That’s great.

227
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,890
You called me out

228
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,170
just to ask about this?

229
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,610
You don’t want to talk to me then?

230
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,010
Not really.

231
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,370
I just don’t know what to talk about between us.

232
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,530
After all,

233
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,450
we’re opponents.

234
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,690
Why are you so dumb?

235
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,010
Are you normal?

236
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,530
Shrek School is famous for monsters.

237
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,370
If there’s nothing else, I’ll go first.

238
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,690
You.

239
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,570
Wait,

240
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,290
are you that impatient with me?

241
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,410
You can leave,

242
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,690
but answer my question first.

243
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,690
Go on.

244
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,170
That day,

245
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,810
why did you save me?

246
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,530
Why did you use your body to resist the strike?

247
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,130
That strike was to attack you.

248
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,090
This is your question?

249
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,490
And also the reason you called me over?

250
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,010
Yes.

251
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,490
We’re opponents,

252
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,890
but not enemies.

253
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,570
You attacked me to win.

254
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,010
We didn’t have any deep grudges.

255
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,090
Your death will elevate
the conflict between our schools.

256
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,290
If I endured that strike,
I wouldn’t have any danger.

257
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,050
That’s it?

258
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,050
Yes.

259
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,250
Tang San.

260
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,090
Be careful.

261
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,490
[Next Episode]
The last three rounds will be very tough.

262
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,810
Their overall strength is
higher than Chi Huo School.

263
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,290
They’re no doubt the strongest team.

264
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,610
The flying ability of Lei Tian

265
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,890
can restrain soul masters who attack close.

266
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,410
Third soul skill, Wings of Lightning.

267
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,690
What do you mean?

268
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,490
With that person, how is this a coincidence?

269
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,850
I shall leave now.

270
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,690
You can’t run away from this.

271
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,250
What should we do?

272
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,810
Fourth soul skill, Lightning Eagle.

273
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,010
Using first soul skill to
resist my fourth soul skill?

274
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,210
You’re belittling me.

275
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,290
Don’t stop me.

276
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,850
I want to report that Shrek School
has attempted a murder.
