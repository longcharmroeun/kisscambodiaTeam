[Previous Episode] Welcome to
the twelfth preliminary.

Seven Shura Fantasy!

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,170
Today, you’ll be dead!

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,120
Reincarnate endlessly in this painful abyss!

Purple Demon Eye.

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,180
If the lie is seen,

29
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,440
how would the person who lied be punished?

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,180
You really don’t know anything, right?

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,680
Dean, you’re saying that...

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Call the students
who participated in the contest!

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,900
I want to interrogate every one of them.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 78]

35
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,260
Call the students
who participated in the contest!

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,880
I want to interrogate every one of them.

37
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,340
No way. These kids are badly injured.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,660
If they weren’t rescued immediately,

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,340
I’m afraid their entire soul master’s
career will be affected.

40
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Do you want to spoil
their soul master’s career

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,740
because of an interrogation?

42
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,060
Since there are six injured out of seven,

43
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,120
wasn’t there one still standing?

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,440
He was Tang San, right?

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
Call him.

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,100
The...

47
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,400
<i>Salas is so determined to make it hard to Shrek.</i>

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,740
All right. Er Long, get Tang San here.

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,140
Let Grandmaster get some desserts
from our school here too.

50
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,380
Okay.

51
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,520
<i>How can our school have money
for dessert? Could it be...</i>

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,660
Lords, you don’t know.

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,120
This time, Shrek School’s students
are seriously injured.

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,780
I’m afraid we can’t participate for
the coming preliminary.

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,180
Are the casualties of Shrek School so serious?

56
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,180
Even they’re serious,

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,320
they wouldn’t become idiots like Cang Hui School.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
As the organizing committee,

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,760
I have a reason to doubt Shrek School

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,820
for maliciously aiming at Cang Hui School.

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,440
How can you jump to conclusions?

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,640
You haven’t understood the truth yet.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,100
You’re so eager to charge Shrek School?

64
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,430
You asked for it!

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,230
Salas!

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
Humph!

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,120
Little San, how do you feel?

68
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,020
Dean, are you looking for me?

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,520
They are the organizing committees
of the contest.

70
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
You explain it to them

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,480
what has happened during the battle
with Cang Hui School?

72
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Shrek! Goodbye.

73
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

74
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,960
<i>My body can’t move!</i>

75
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,160
<i>Fantasy is a lie to the vision.</i>

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
<i>If the lie is seen,</i>

77
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,880
<i>how would the person who lied be punished?</i>

78
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
<i>Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.</i>

79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,080
<i>Boss Dai and others, I’m sorry.</i>

<i>Facing with Seven In One Fusion Skill,</i>

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,020
<i>we must be seriously injured.</i>

82
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
I don’t know.

83
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
What? You don’t know?

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,940
I couldn’t see things clearly at that time.

85
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,980
I had to release soul skills at random.

86
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,880
When I could see clearly,

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,400
they had already fallen to the ground.

88
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,760
How dare you...

89
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
What? You don’t know?

90
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,680
How could you not know?

91
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,800
At that time, there were only you and them.

92
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
How could you not know?

93
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,600
Dean, I really didn’t know.

94
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Maybe Cang Hui’s students were
backfired by their own soul skills

95
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
and lost their mind.

96
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,540
Enough!

97
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,580
Stop echoing and supporting each other!

98
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,920
Tang San! You refuse to be interrogated!

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,860
Shrek School is suspected of covering up a crime!

100
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,900
I announce

101
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,560
Shrek School is removed from this contest!

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,960
Lord, you’re arbitrary. I’m afraid
it doesn’t conform to the rules.

103
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,740
This is my authority!

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Pope token?

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Salas. You’re not worth being
the Martial Soul Temple Platinum Chief.

106
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,260
Greetings to you, Elder.

107
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,260
<i>One who has this token, just like the Pope is here.</i>

108
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,620
<i>No wonder Salas is so respectful.</i>

109
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,320
Elder, please take it back.

110
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,300
Elder, I acted rashly.

111
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,320
We’ll exempt this interrogation.

112
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,440
We’re leaving.

113
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,940
Chief, don’t go in a hurry.

114
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,600
Come and try some of our desserts.

115
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,260
That is a well-known specialty of our school.

116
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,180
Chief!

117
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,020
I’m leaving too.

118
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,120
I am sorry I cannot escort you farther.

119
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,720
Yu Xiao Gang!

120
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,500
How dare you still have contact
with that woman!

121
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,020
No.

122
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,440
Er Long, you’ve misunderstood.

123
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,800
Misunderstood? That woman
even gave you the Pope token!

124
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,380
What is the misunderstanding?

125
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,340
The Pope token was not given by her.

126
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,540
Who else?

127
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,300
Little San’s father gave it to me.

128
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Little San’s father?

129
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,720
The Grand Soul Land Master, Hao Tian.

130
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:31,740
[Soul Land]

131
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,540
Twenty-seven rounds of the preliminary
are coming to an end.

132
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,040
Today is the last match between
Shrek School and Tian Shui School.

133
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,440
It’s said that Shrek School had
2 loses out of 26 matches.

134
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,940
Tian Shui School had
3 loses out of 26 matches.

135
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,440
Let’s hurry and have a look.

136
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,980
Hasn’t that Shrek School lost before?

137
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,500
Why did they lose 2 matches?

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,160
Last time, it’s an internecine game
between Shrek and Cang Hui.

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,540
Cang Hui’s team members became idiots.

140
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,320
Shrek’s team members had also
injured badly and gave up two games.

141
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,200
My God! Cang Hui School is so pitiful!

142
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,260
Exactly. Soul skills have no eyes on the field.

143
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,720
Let’s go. It’s going to start.

144
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,300
Brother Tang. Today is the last game.

145
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,440
You have to do your best.

146
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,380
<i>Why did he come to see us
before every match?</i>

147
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,300
Since Senior Feng is so anticipated
to meet us in the finals,

148
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,740
then you’d better not lose.

149
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,400
So, you’re saying that

150
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,520
Shrek School’s goal is the champion.

151
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,040
Shen Feng School doesn’t want it?

152
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,040
Of course not.

153
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,700
Who wants to confront
those from Martial Soul Hall?

154
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,200
Anyways, we just pray not to meet them so soon.

155
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,880
I’ll go first.

156
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,700
Feng Xiao Tian must have
known something.

157
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,160
Master has told me before.

158
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,800
Martial Soul Hall is much more powerful
than anyone expected.

159
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,040
Look. Dai Mu Bai from Shrek School
is so handsome.

160
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,840
Don’t you be too obsessed with him
until you throw the match.

161
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,060
Okay. Stop the nonsense.

162
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,980
Shrek School is a powerful rival.

163
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,900
We must do our best till the end, understand?

164
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,940
Yes, Captain.

165
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,620
Although the match is going to end
after one more round,

166
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,900
the actually qualified teams
have already been determined

167
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,280
according to the match situation.

168
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
The sequence is

169
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,480
Lei Ting School,

170
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,020
Shen Feng School,

171
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,440
Shrek School,

172
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,020
Chi Huo School and Tian Shui School.

173
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,300
This is the last game for the preliminary.

174
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,880
We couldn’t get the first place,

175
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,100
But we must at least get into the top three.

176
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,520
We must not lose to Tian Shui School.

177
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,560
It’s said that Tian Shui School has all girls.

178
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,920
How can we fight?

179
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,680
Don’t ever look down on Tian Shui School.

180
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,380
Tian Shui is the veteran strong team.

181
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,200
They beat Chi Huo School in the previous battle.

182
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,240
You must know that Chi Huo defeated
Shen Feng at the second place.

183
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,500
Teacher Qin is right.

184
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,380
Tian Shui School must not easy to be defeated.

185
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,520
But Shrek School never fears any enemy.

186
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,480
That’s right. Shrek never fears any enemy.

187
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
Shrek! Must win!

188
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,360
Finally, we’ve come to the
last match of the preliminary.

189
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,640
Let’s welcome teams from Shrek School
and Tian Shui to enter the field.

190
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,480
The formations of both teams are quite similar.

191
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,400
How big is the gap in the data?

192
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,860
First, let’s look at Tian Shui School.

193
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,260
Tian Shui School team captain, Shui Bing Er.

194
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,320
Controlling Branch War Soul Sect at Level 43.

195
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,900
She led Tian Shui School

196
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,020
to enter the top five of the preliminary.

197
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,220
What kind of wonderful performance
will there be today?

198
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,600
Other than the captain,

199
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,360
Tian Shui School has also sent
another two Soul Sects.

200
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,140
Their strength shouldn’t be
underestimated either.

201
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,339
<i>The opponent has also sent
three Soul Sects.</i>

202
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,419
<i>Moreover, this captain is also
a soul master of the Controlling Branch.</i>

203
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,460
<i>I’m afraid Little San has met his opponent.</i>

204
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,480
Besides, four Soul Honors
owned ferocious Martial Souls.

205
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Tian Shui School’s determination
to win is shown here.

206
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,000
What kind of lineup did Shrek School send?

207
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,740
Shrek School’s Captain, Dai Mu Bai.

208
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,560
The strength is quite powerful.

209
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,599
Vice Captain, Tang San.

210
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,720
Today, he meets a soul master of
Controlling Branch, who has a higher level.

211
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,780
Can he still win as always?

212
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,900
It’s really surprising.

213
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,000
Shrek School chooses the same formation
as the first round of preliminaries.

214
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,100
Do they also

215
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,860
prepare to defeat their opponent

216
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,420
in one minute this time?

217
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,060
<i>The two other Soul Sects</i>

218
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,540
<i>didn’t participate at all for this time.</i>

219
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,500
<i>Are they looking down on us?</i>

220
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,340
Which team will win

221
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,520
and get the third place
to enter the qualifying rounds?

222
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,160
Both teams get ready!

223
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,540
Start!

224
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,010
[Next Episode]
At least, buy some time for Little San.

225
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,110
It’s still early to be happy.

226
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,070
Shui Bing Er’s skill seems to have restricted Little San.

227
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,830
It’s bad! It’s Martial Soul Fusion Skill!

228
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,350
Little San, can you resist it?

229
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,370
But I can’t be defeated.
