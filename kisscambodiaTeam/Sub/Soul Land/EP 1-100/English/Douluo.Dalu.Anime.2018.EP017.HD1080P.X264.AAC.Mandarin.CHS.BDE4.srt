Forget about your sausage,

21
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,510
Big Sausage Uncle.

22
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,920
What Big Sausage Uncle?

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,310
I’ll shave my beard tomorrow.

24
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,510
Why did you break up with you?

25
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,320
Stop!

26
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,680
I’ll show you what is actual strength.

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,830
Is there such a fat phoenix?

28
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,540
I think he looks more like a chicken.

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,500
Who are you calling a chicken?

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,480
Let me do it.

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,270
How is it, Fatty? You want to fight again?

Little Rabbit, come on!

34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,750
Stop fighting.

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,080
Hong Jun is a good person.

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,010
But we don’t suit each other,

37
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,740
so we had to break up.

38
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,670
You all may leave, I’ll talk to him.

39
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,360
Don’t mind my business, go away!

00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,640
Fatty.

42
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,180
What are you all doing here?

43
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,670
What are we doing?

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,150
Ask him!

45
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,370
This Fatty bullies a girl in broad daylight.

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,570
Xiao Wu,

47
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,510
I think you misunderstood.

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,140
I’ll do it myself.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,580
Miss Cui Hua, you...

50
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,640
What’s going on?

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,840
Are you going to say it,

52
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,810
or I say it?

53
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,700
Go on.

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,540
Do you remember that I told you...

55
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,730
there are three students
including me in our school?

56
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,760
You mean...

57
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,240
Yes, Fatty is the third one,

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,680
and he entered the school latest
before you both did.

59
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,370
Even though I didn’t see what happened,

60
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,000
I still can guess it.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,900
We can’t blame Fatty,

62
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,340
we can only blame his chicken.

63
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,340
Nonsense,

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
it’s not a chicken!

65
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,740
My Martial Soul is a phoenix!

66
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,910
Even if my parents’ are chickens,

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,100
mine is still a phoenix!

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,840
Haven’t you hear of

69
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,570
“golden phoenix among the bush”?

70
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:35,770
Phoenix?

71
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,670
Alright,

72
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,110
phoenix then.

73
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:39,840
Tang San,

74
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,240
Fatty’s Martial Soul looks weird.

75
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,650
The Dean said he has a Mutated Martial Soul.

76
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,390
Mutated Martial Soul?

77
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,840
Which two Martial Souls mutated?

78
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,870
I have no idea,

79
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,870
Let alone me,

80
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,440
not even Fatty himself.

81
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,440
People from his village...

82
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,310
get poultry-type Martial Souls
without attack ability.

83
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,610
Who knows,

84
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,870
when it’s his turn,

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,310
his Martial Soul is mutated,

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,700
and he was born with the ability of flame.

87
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,620
Fatty’s flame is strange too,

88
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,110
not only it’s always over-heated,

89
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,560
it’s also adhesive and hard to put off.

90
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,970
The Dean said

91
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,740
after his Martial Soul mutated,

92
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,510
it might really be a phoenix.

93
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:26,770
But...

94
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,540
his Martial Soul also has a flaw.

95
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,060
What is it?

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,300
It always loses control...

97
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,570
and harm the others near it.

98
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,330
Everything around will burn up
if he is being careless.

99
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,830
What’s that got to do with the break up?

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,760
You know nothing!

101
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,830
Fatty has been dumped a few times before.

102
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,400
This time, the girl has accepted him.

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,310
Fatty’s emotion is a little fluctuated,

104
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,210
especially in some aspects.

105
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,970
So, she can’t take this.

106
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,840
Nonsense,

107
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,110
when I lose control, all I have to do is to eat.

108
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,240
I don’t need anything else.

109
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,110
Yes,

110
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,770
control by eating.

111
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,070
That’s why people call you “Fire Chicken”.

112
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,380
It’s “Fire Phoenix”!

113
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,520
I can’t even believe this people actually exists.

114
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,730
I’m unlike you and Little Ao,

115
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,350
you both look like boy toys.

116
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,270
Don’t think that I don’t know you would go places...

117
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,960
and date with different girls every day.

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,610
Fatty,

119
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,270
you can’t say nonsense.

120
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,840
in front of them.

121
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Don’t you always feel proud
and never feel humiliated?

122
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,740
What’s

123
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,940
wrong with you today?

124
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,540
Stop that.

125
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,210
if you spoil my reputation again

126
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,340
I won’t spare you.

127
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,670
What about our training in the future?

128
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,870
What else can we do?

129
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,640
Turn our anger into appetite.

130
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,790
Little San, I’m hungry.

131
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,240
Let’s go,

132
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,740
I’ll bring you to eat something.

133
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,070
You’d better

134
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,010
calm your fire down.

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,810
Why?

136
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,470
Are you going to tackle them?

137
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,940
Boss Dai,

138
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,340
even if you’re the boss,

139
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,930
you have to leave something for us, right?

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,640
Little Ao must be overslept again.

141
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,280
Let me introduce,

142
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,370
this fatty is another student from our school,

143
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
Ma Hong Jun.

144
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,340
and his Martial Soul is Chic...Phoenix!

145
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,330
Isn’t that Uncle Sausage?

146
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,490
Hi, Uncle Sausage!

147
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,510
Hey, Boss Dai, Fatty.
Good morning, everyone!

148
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,090
You overslept again?

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,620
Morning, Uncle Sausage.

150
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,370
Pretty girl, please call me

151
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,070
The Sausage Oscar.

152
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,130
Your beard...

153
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,510
Look at the new pretty girls.

154
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,020
If I don’t touch up a bit,
how would they ever look at me?

155
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,800
The Dean is here.

156
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,840
[Soul Land]

157
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,850
Little San, isn’t him the profiteer?

158
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,040
What profiteer?

159
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,270
He’s our Dean.

160
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,140
The founder of Shrek School,

161
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,010
Frander, the Four-Eyed Owl.

162
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,400
A Soul Saint of Level 78,

163
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,460
even stronger than Teacher Zhao.

164
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,480
He owns a flying-type beast soul,

165
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,120
that’s quite rare among the war soul masters.

166
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,800
I can’t believe he even said that...

167
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,790
he only accepts “monsters”, not the ordinary.

168
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,820
Luckily, he’s only at Level 78.

169
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,560
Uncle Sausage,

170
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,410
does our school have soul master
with highest soul level?

171
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,070
Please call me

172
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,140
The Sausage Oscar.

173
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,900
You mentioned Great Soul Land Master?

174
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,790
Great Soul Land Master
isn’t easily found here and there.

175
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,960
There are less than a hundred masters
who have earned this title.

176
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,210
They’re all supported by the Empire
and subordinate kingdoms.

177
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,580
And the Grand Soul Land Master,

178
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,340
there are only around ten in both Empires.

179
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,190
It’s not that easy to meet them.

180
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,560
Great then.

181
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,230
Xiao Wu, what’s wrong?

182
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,810
Dealing with this profiteer is insulting us.

183
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,080
<i>If you don’t have enough money,</i>

184
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,860
<i>I can only collect 200 gold soul coins first.</i>

185
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,360
<i>You can pay the remaining later
with 10% interest.</i>

186
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,240
<i>Profiteer, why don’t you get lost?</i>

187
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,520
It’s nothing.

188
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,640
Little San, do you think if he remembers us?

189
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,580
It has only been two days,
he surely still remembers it.

190
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,570
But since he’s the Dean,

191
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,040
I think he won’t care about it.

192
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,770
You’re wrong.

193
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,910
Dean Frander is a grudge-holding person.

194
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,910
Of course, it’s his strong point is
to justify his faults.

195
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,010
<i>That’s bad.</i>

196
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,640
<i>I think he heard me.</i>

197
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,270
<i>I think I’m in trouble.</i>

198
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,370
It’s great this year,

199
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,570
we have another four small monsters.

200
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,750
I, Frander, Dean of the Shrek School,

201
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,120
welcome you all on behalf of the school.

202
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,510
Later on, every one of you hand in

203
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,540
a hundred gold coins to Teacher Li.

204
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,080
For assisting-type soul master,

205
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,010
it’s dangerous once you’re
unprotected in battlefield.

206
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,710
Therefore,

207
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,310
you must learn how to flee.

208
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,870
Oscar.

209
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,440
Ning Rong Rong.

210
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,370
Twenty rounds...

211
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,780
starting now.

212
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,790
Forget about your lunch
if you can’t finish before that.

213
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Yes!

214
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,330
Oscar leads the way.

215
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,910
Yes.

216
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,670
Go!

217
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,320
Mu Bai.

218
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,370
Dean.

219
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,810
Tell the newcomers about the school rules.

220
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,010
Alright, Dean.

221
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,480
Your first lesson will start at night.

222
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,170
You,

223
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,770
come with me alone.

224
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,750
How’s Grandmaster doing?

225
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,360
Master is fine.

226
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,730
His student?

227
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,320
No wonder...

228
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,460
Oh, right.

229
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,060
He asked me to pass this to you.

230
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,830
You old man!

231
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,400
Prove? Why must he prove it?

232
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,370
Since you’re his proof,

233
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,940
don’t disappoint him.

234
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,540
Tribe Chief,

235
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,140
Miss Ning has been selected
by the Shrek School.

236
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,780
How’s it in Shrek?

237
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,380
There are a few strong soul masters
in Shrek School,

238
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,020
and at least one Soul Saint.

239
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,170
I can’t enter for more investigation.

240
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,840
But their teacher has passed

241
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,270
your letter to the Dean.

242
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:41,640
Alright,

243
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,270
got it.

244
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,310
Feng Zhi,

245
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,440
aren’t you worried about Rong Rong alone outside?

246
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,040
Uncle Sword.

247
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,540
Can the Shrek School

248
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,040
teach her better than us?

249
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,720
Super Invincible Big Sausage!

250
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,430
Here.

251
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,110
Take it.

252
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,870
You won’t be able
to finish without eating it.

253
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,210
It’s ok. Eat it.

254
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,710
Well, I have super red bean bun.

255
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,970
Back off.

256
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,370
Uncle Sword.

257
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,340
Don’t worry,

258
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,440
The Shrek’s Dean is

259
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,870
the top master of the Golden Iron Triangle.

260
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,860
Rong Rong is going to be fine.

261
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,130
No way,

262
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,140
I’m going to fetch her.

263
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,670
I feel worried that she’s out there.

264
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,770
Uncle Sword,

265
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,470
you and Uncle Dragon

266
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,100
have spoiled her to much.

267
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,910
Now she doesn’t even listen to us.

268
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,230
Sending her to school

269
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,910
might change her.

270
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,510
Who said we spoiled Rong Rong?

271
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,570
I need to talk to him.

272
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,370
Uncle Sword,

273
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,170
you have to listen to me this time.

274
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,910
Let our devil girl gain
some experience out there.

275
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,360
We can’t let her do whatever she wants to do.

276
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,880
Hmph.

277
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,110
You are to blame

278
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,440
if anything happens to her.

279
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,560
[Next episode]

280
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,770
Frander, who do you think you are?

281
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,570
Since you look down at this place,

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,640
then please leave.

283
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,090
How dare you, Frander!

284
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,930
Depart. To the Soul Arena.
