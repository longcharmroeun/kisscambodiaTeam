[Previous Episode]

24
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,180
Brother!

25
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,930
Little San!

26
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,100
Thank you, Xiao Wu.

27
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,760
[Soul Land]
[Episode 67]

28
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,000
Little San, what is your fourth soul skill?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
Show us.

30
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,240
It’s nothing special.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,560
It’s similar to the skill
used by the Burrow Demon Spider.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,240
But there are some changes.

33
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,450
Do you want to see it?

34
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,650
Of course.

35
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,050
You are the first one to get
the Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

36
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,570
Come on, show us.

37
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,830
The Blue Silver Plant turned black.

38
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,460
- When did you get this?
- When did you get this?

39
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,620
<i>There was no energy surge
when it was triggered.</i>

40
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,800
This is my fourth soul skill.

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,610
This is the Spider Web Cage
stemmed from the Burrow Demon Spider.

42
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,380
This cage is formed by Blue Silver Plant.

43
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,730
So I named it the Blue Silver Cage.

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,149
It doesn’t seem very sturdy.

45
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,900
It’s not even as strong as
Constraint of Spider Web.

46
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,690
Brother San, this is all your
Decade Millennium Soul Skill can do?

47
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,100
Is that so?

48
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,360
Crowd-control skill?

49
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,480
But only soul master from Controlling
Branch above Level 50 can do this!

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,660
This is terrifying.

51
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,890
A mere cage may be nothing,

52
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,550
but it takes time to break it.

53
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,810
And during that time,

54
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,030
the partners of Controlling Branch
soul master can do many things.

55
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,700
Brother San, can you combine
this skill with my move?

56
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,960
Of course.

57
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,430
Blue Silver Cage is a pre-emptive skill,

58
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,340
your Phoenix Strike restrains opponents
during the battle.

59
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,020
If we can use it optimally,

60
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,430
our attacks will be maximized
to their greatest potentials.

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,480
I think the champion mission given to
them might have been too easy.

62
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Their strengths are off the charts.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Cut it off. Are you amazed by their power

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
or are you applauding yourself?

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,540
Shut it, Er Long.

66
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,050
I just helped you and now you are mocking me?

67
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,020
I shouldn’t have treated you so well.

68
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,400
We need to head back to Shrek School soon.

69
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,120
The Continental Competition
is only five days from now.

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,670
Get some rest once you got back.

71
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,870
Tomorrow morning,

72
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,330
we will gather in the forest
at the back of the school building.

73
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,900
Is that clear?

74
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,400
Yes!

75
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,320
What is taking the teachers so long?

76
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,080
Where is everyone?

77
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,960
These four over here are your
substitute teammates.

78
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,720
You may introduce yourselves now.

79
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
War soul master at Level 35
from Storm Attack Branch, Huang Yuan.

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,030
War soul master at Level 35
from Keen Attack Branch, Jing Ling.

81
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,880
Tool soul master at Level 35
from Healing Branch, Jiang Zhu.

82
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,360
I don’t have to introduce myself,
you all know who I am.

83
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,780
They are the elite students

84
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,500
mentored by Er Long.

85
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,390
If it wasn’t for the competition,

86
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,600
they would have graduated long ago
with their strength.

87
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,670
I think the substitutes need to work
on teamwork with us.

88
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,190
Substitute members are compulsory
to form a team for the competition.

89
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,710
The competition will be difficult
far beyond your imagination.

90
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,280
With only seven members,

91
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,740
whether it’s stamina or
skill combinations,

92
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,040
you will fall short in face of obstacles
and the number of opponents.

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,450
Everyone, have a seat.

94
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,020
In a few days,

95
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,120
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament will begin.

96
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,190
I will explain the rules to you now.

97
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,600
Take this seriously.

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,320
The rules can be limitations,
but also be your advantages.

99
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,200
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament,

100
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,920
which is organized by royalties of
Tian Dou and Xin Luo

101
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,410
and the Martial Soul Hall,

102
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,300
is the greatest
Martial Soul competition of all time.

103
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,790
The strengths of the participants

104
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,640
are second only to the elite members
of Martial Soul Hall qualifiers.

105
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,380
As per the rules,

106
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,650
the participants from each school

107
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,160
must be under the age of 25 years old.

108
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,070
Each round will be participated
by seven members.

109
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,890
No death is allowed during the competition.

110
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,220
Grandmaster, that doesn’t sound fair.

111
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,210
What if we killed someone from a misfire?

112
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,750
You are certainly right about this.

113
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,780
But you must understand,

114
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,740
the two empires hold this competition
to hand-pick the best of the best.

115
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,670
It’s never meant to be a fight to death.

116
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,960
During the competition,

117
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,710
you cannot consume any item not made by
the Food or Healing Branches.

118
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,720
Any weapon other than the Martial Soul
is not allowed either.

119
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,880
Which means traps and hidden weapons
can’t be used.

120
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,950
You must bear these rules in mind.

121
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,700
Breaking them will only mean disqualification.

122
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:21,170
[Soul Land]

123
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,840
I will explain the tournament system.

124
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,690
These two rocks represent the two empires.

125
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,480
This rock here represents the Martial Soul Hall.

126
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,540
All teams will be divided into
the main and secondary teams.

127
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,830
The main teams will represent
the two great empires.

128
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,560
They will advance into the finals directly.

129
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,820
The secondary team will join
the preliminary with other soul masters.

130
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,640
Tian Dou has six main regions
for the preliminary.

131
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,420
There are more than one hundred teams.

132
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,300
All will be eliminated
except for 15 soul masters.

133
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,160
For the region of Tian Dou,
there are too many advanced schools,

134
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,540
only five soul masters can advance.

135
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,030
Preliminary and qualifying rounds
are not the same.

136
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,600
You battle as a team in preliminary rounds.

137
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,020
But seven soul masters will be bid
against each other in qualifying rounds.

138
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,680
The 33 teams in the finals will
battle in draw elimination rounds.

139
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,640
Grandmaster, there are two seed teams.

140
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
30 teams will advance through
the qualifying rounds.

141
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,190
There should be 32 teams.

142
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,030
Where is the other team?

143
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,990
I forgot to mention.

144
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,480
There are three seed teams, not two.

145
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,780
The third team is from the Martial Soul Hall.

146
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,530
They’re much stronger
than the Emperor Battle Team.

147
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,180
The finals will be elimination rounds.

148
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,450
The first round will be a bye
for the three seed teams.

149
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,360
In the second round, the two best
qualifier teams will be in a bye.

150
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,910
The same rules apply to
the third round as well.

151
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,460
After the third round,
only the best six teams will remain.

152
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,200
In the fourth round, each team will
draw lot to determine the opponents.

153
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,920
The top three will be battle in
both team fight and eliminations.

154
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,000
As long as you win every round,
none of these will matter.

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,880
Only three of you will battle
in the preliminary rounds.

156
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,130
Rong Rong won’t battle,
I have special training for her.

157
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,310
Only three of us can battle?

158
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,480
If you expose your strength
too early in the competition,

159
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,280
the path afterwards will be difficult.

160
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,870
I understand, Master.

161
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,830
You will be in charge of the strategies.

162
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,700
Tai Long and Huang Yuan are both
from Storm Attack Branch.

163
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,450
They can be our vanguard.

164
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,130
Jing Ling is from the Keen Attack Branch.

165
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,360
His Skeleton Martial Soul
will be unpredictable to the opponents.

166
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Jiang Zhu’s healing sceptre is not
as powerful as Little Ao’s or Rong Rong’s.

167
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,630
But she is one of the best in Support Branch.

168
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,840
Tai Long and his friends haven’t
reached Level 40 yet,

169
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,640
but they are the best candidates to
hide our true strength.

170
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,960
That’s why they were picked by Grandmaster.

171
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Who will battle tomorrow?

172
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,670
You, Xiao Wu and me.

173
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,560
Little devils.

174
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,980
For the Advanced Soul Master School Contest,

175
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,810
I designed a new batch of cool
and dashing uniforms for you.

176
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I hope it’s not the last one we had.

177
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,790
We will be the champions!

178
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,930
We need to be strong and cool looking!

179
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,000
Could it be...

180
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,210
This is even more hideous
than our previous outfits.

181
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,240
So? Aren’t they cool?

182
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,260
This uniform is so ugly, it’s like...

183
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,150
Dean, don’t you have a sense of aesthetic?

184
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,920
And the product placement is so embarrassing.

185
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,380
That is for our school budget.

186
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,180
But...

187
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,910
I have other works to do.

188
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,570
Try out your new uniforms.

189
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,640
Brother San, I don’t want to wear it.

190
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,670
Master...

191
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,000
Consider this an ordeal for your minds.

192
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,650
No!

193
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,800
Wow! So many people!

194
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,630
What school are they from?

195
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,710
Did they come out from
the sewer or something?

196
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,250
There is even an advertisement on their backs!

197
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,120
Nothing is too weird nowadays!

198
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,990
Shut it, they are soul masters.

199
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,120
But they do have a fat guy with them.

200
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,230
He is round like a ball.

201
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,350
I don’t want to wear this uniform anymore.

202
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,770
This is ruining my image!

203
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,860
We’ll talk to the Dean about this later.

204
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,390
At least, we can remove the advertisement.

205
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,600
Why do you have to choose
a place so remote out here?

206
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,550
Pull yourselves together.

207
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,230
We are here to be the champion!

208
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,760
Champion?

209
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,080
Even losers want to be a champion?

210
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,060
Did you just call us losers?

211
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,940
Who else are wearing that ugly green uniforms?

212
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,320
I will show you who is the real losers here!

213
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,960
Where do these mutts come from?

214
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,770
Did you just call us mutts?

215
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,819
Aren’t them from the  Cang Hui School?

216
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,959
Why are they picking a fight on us?

217
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,970
What do you think you’re doing?

218
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,230
[Next Episode]

219
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,280
It’s starting, let’s go.

220
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,670
His Majesty of Tian Dou Empire

221
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,040
will officiate the competition!

222
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,320
So he is Emperor Xue Ye?

223
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,320
Look up there!

224
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,180
I know a team,

225
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
they might win this competition for the empire.

226
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,270
The Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament,

227
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,560
will begin its first-round battle!
