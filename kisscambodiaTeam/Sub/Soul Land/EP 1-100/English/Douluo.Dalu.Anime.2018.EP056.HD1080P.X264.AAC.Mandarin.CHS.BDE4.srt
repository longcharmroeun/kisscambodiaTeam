Brat, are you new?

21
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,100
Are you convinced now?

22
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,840
No!

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,640
I’ll beat you till you concede.

24
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,700
There’s some soul power left here.

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,860
What kind of treasure is it

26
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,800
that those won’t hesitate to kill
the guards of the auction house.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Could it be a soul bone?

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Stop there.

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,880
Bidding qualification certificate?

00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,060
We’ll sell this then.

31
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,520
I named it Malicious Attack.

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,660

[Episode 56]

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,900
I’m afraid this steel plate is unbearable.

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,040
You may not believe...

36
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,620
this steel plate has been tested
over a hundred times.

37
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,740
It’s sturdy and has never been damaged.
Don’t worry.

38
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,400
Please.

39
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,600
What a powerful weapon.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,420
<i>It might be weaker than Godly Zhuge Crossbow,</i>

41
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,300
<i>but such piercing force isn’t resistible
by ordinary soul masters.</i>

42
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,580
<i>Malicious Attack can shoot 3 times</i>

43
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,140
<i>when it’s fully loaded with steel needles.</i>

44
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,140
<i>Every shooting associates with poisonous mist.</i>

45
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,700
<i>A needle itself contains a paralytic toxin.</i>

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,860
<i>Even those above Level 30 would be
tackled if they can’t resist poison.</i>

47
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,200
Honored guest, I’ve ever seen
such a refined weapon.

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,100
I’ll put this lot starting at
1,000 gold soul coins.

49
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,820
What do you think?

50
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,540
1,000 gold soul coins?

51
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,240
No problem.

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,760
Are we qualified to join
the auction now?

53
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,480
Certainly.

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,360
Thank you for coming.

55
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,780
There may be some peculiar treasures in this auction.

56
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,360
I think so.

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,540
Wear a mask before entering the auction.

58
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,220
For your safety purpose.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,060
35,000.  35,000 gold soul coins in the white area.

60
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
36,000 gold soul coins in the yellow area.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,880
Any higher bid?

62
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,060
36,000 first, 36,000 twice, 36,000...

63
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,080
37,000 gold soul coins in the red area.

64
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,540
This way, please.

65
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,900
What arrogance.

66
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,740
Let’s go.

67
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,280
The attendants all behave in the same manner,

68
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,840
she’s not against you.

69
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,980
In the same manner? What do you mean?

70
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,940
They were bought by the auction house
for training since they were young.

71
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,020
They’re not only the attendants here,

72
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,700
but as a lot for auction too.

73
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,660
They have no expression,
because they’ve lost their thoughts

74
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,920
and soul.

75
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,220
Is that slavery?

76
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,960
But the slave trade has been
banned in two empires.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Nothing can’t be sold here.

78
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,800
How much do they cost?

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,540
You want to buy them and release them?

80
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,280
That’s another tragedy though.

81
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,720
Why?

82
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,480
They’re like caged birds
who have no choice but staying here.

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,820
They have no survival skills,
neither thought nor soul.

84
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,480
How could they survive after leaving here?

85
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,180
They’ll end up in disillusion and perish.

86
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,140
Soul guiding tool at 43,000 gold soul coins. Sold!

87
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,900
You came to the auction house at this young age,

88
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,320
do you have anything to buy?

89
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,500
We’re not buying, but selling.

90
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,000
The next lot up for auction

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,620
is a rare item.

92
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,840
Please draw your attention here,
especially male guests.

93
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,820
It’s a nonpareil among all.

94
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,420
Can anyone give a guess?

95
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,320
It may be a rare treasure.

96
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,760
Well.

97
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,800
I’ll first reveal the starting price of this lot.

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,340
100,000 gold soul coins.

99
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,440
Every increase of the bid is not
less than 10,000 gold soul coins.

100
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,240
My honored guests, please pay attention.

101
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,939
Perhaps you may be curious about

102
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,820
why this girl

103
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,820
has the same price as our beauty
fostered by the auction house.

104
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,520
She’s extraordinary if you look carefully.

105
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,020
You’re right, this is a precious cat lady.

106
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,920
Her body mutated when her martial soul awakened.

107
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,020
Hence, she possesses a cat’s figure.

108
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,760
It’ll be extremely great

109
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,300
having a gorgeous cat lady as a pet.

110
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,720
My guests, you can bid now.

111
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,480
Bastards, how can they sell her as a pet?

112
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,040
Even if you’re able to save this cat lady now,

113
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,620
there will be a panther lady or a tigress lady.

114
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,080
Are you going to save them all?

115
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,640
It’s meaningless to save
those who’ve lost their soul.

116
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,500
How could I not save one with soul?

117
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
110,000 gold soul coins.

118
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,100
120,000 gold soul coins.

119
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,160
110,000 gold soul coins from this side.

120
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,080
170,000. A gentleman bids for
170,000 gold soul coins from red area.

121
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,520
Any more for it?

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,580
I fathom your thoughts.

123
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,340
Ah! 180,000 gold soul coins from the white area.

124
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,380
Let’s me see who dares to fight with me.

126
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,280
Aren’t they the Qibao Amber Tribe?

127
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,620
Auction house has its own rules.

128
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,060
Can we continue?

129
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,000
Sure, of course.

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,240
180,000 gold soul coins, twice.

131
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,660

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,220
Thank you, Uncle.

134
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,780
It’s a worthwhile trip.
Let’s see the last lot.

135
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,680
Dad, please return. It’s our matter.

136
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,500
You’re making me even more embarrassed.

137
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,200
How could I tolerate that my son got beaten?

138
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,480
I don’t deserve to be called
the Supreme God, Tai Nuo.

139
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,700
I come to see

140
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,960
who dares to beat my son.

141
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,880
Dad, you’re making me difficult.

142
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,680
How am I supposed to staying in this school later?

143
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,820
Your school didn’t even care that you’re beaten.

144
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,500
When I catch that brat,

145
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,280
I’ll have your teacher to judge.

146
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,520
Well, Dad. It’s me starting the fight.

147
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,420
Nothing to do with Tang San.

148
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,500
So embarrassing! Picking up the duel
and yet got beaten by him?

149
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,060
You’ve disgraced me!

150
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,360
Tang San!

151
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,020
Brother, isn’t that our Malicious Attack?

152
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,720
Malicious Attack? Good name.

153
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,580
This lot is an intricate weapon.

154
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,480
Small size, yet it’s potent.

155
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,700
Instantly launch of 36 steel needles
and conceal with mist.

156
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,740
Within 15 meters,

157
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,100
it can pierce through a 1cm thick steel plate.

158
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,260
It’s also quenched with a paralytic toxin.

159
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,900
We’ll start at 1,000 gold soul coins.

160
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,420
It’s in my interest.

161
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,280
10,000 gold soul coins appears now.

162
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Uncle, did you make a mistake?

163
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,480
I can’t let you make a loss.

164
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,920
Perhaps no one will come to bid
after I increased the price.

165
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,120
10,000 gold soul coins, once.
10,000 gold soul coins, twice.

166
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,380
Last call. Sold!

167
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,620
You spent 10,000 gold soul coins
on my Malicious Attack.

168
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,660
I won’t let you have a loss too.

169
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,540
This Soundless Arrow is also for you.

170
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,760
Tang Clan? I’ve never heard of it before.

171
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,860
My brother is the only one of Tang Clan.

172
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,700
That’s why you’ve not heard of it.

173
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,640
You created these two weapons?

174
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,820
If possible,

175
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,680
I’d like to purchase them in large quantity.

176
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,480
Purchase in large quantity?

177
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,780
Do you think I’m making fun of it?

178
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,160
I’ll bring you to visit my tribe

179
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,560
if you’re interested.

180
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,560
Thanks for your goodwill.

181
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
But we have some matters today.

182
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,220
We’ll meet again.

183
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,680
Well. Certainly.

184
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,600
Xiao Wu, let’s go.

185
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
Tribe Chief, it’s time to return.

186
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,800
All right. Let’s go, Uncle Sword.

187
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
Tai Long, are you still not convinced?

188
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,740
Why are you rolling your eyes?

189
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,380
The two of you, who’s Tang San?

190
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,140
I am.

191
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,900
It’s you little brat!

192
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,240
You’re Tai Long’s father?

193
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,540
Yes, I’m the Supreme God, Tai Nuo.

194
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,680
Give me an explanation,

195
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,320
since you beat my son.

196
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,460
Tai Long, if we also beat your father up,

197
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,660
is your grandfather coming too?

198
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,240
Xiao Wu, please don’t take it wrong.

199
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,080
Dad came because he saw my injuries...

200
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,560
But if my grandpa comes, it’d be worse.

201
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,140
You troublesome woman.

202
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,780
I’ll sort you out after settling this brat.

203
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,000
How dare you insult Xiao Wu?

204
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,480
<i>He’s powerful.</i>

205
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,760
<i>He didn’t even use his soul power.</i>

206
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,660
Let me see how many bouts you can take?

207
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,440
<i>Muscle Twisting Bone Grinding.</i>

208
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,260
<i>It’s rare he can resist my attack head-on.</i>

209
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,660
<i>The scary thing is his powerful strength.</i>

210
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,540
Supreme Orangutan.

211
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,520
Brat, are you scared?
I’ll dislocate your legs first

212
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,880
before getting your teacher to judge.

213
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,500
I’ll make you never dare to beat my son again.

214
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,320
Raise your fist to me.

215
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,100
<i>Father fights for his injured son.</i>

216
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,460
Fine.

217
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,060
First soul skill, Boost.

218
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,140
[Next Episode]
Rong Rong, please don’t lie to Dad.

219
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,400
Dad, you didn’t trust me.

220
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,960
Qibao Amber Pagoda

221
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,100
is the strongest martial soul of Support Branch,

222
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,300
but it has a major flaw.

223
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,380
I really want to know what kind of a genius

224
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,860
your Brother San is.

225
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,500
If he’s really outstanding,

226
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,080
he may be our grandson-in-law.

227
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,800
So strong.

228
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,540
Fourth soul skill, Power Slam.
