00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,430
[Previous Episode] Facing with
Seven In One Fusion Skill,

24
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,910
we must be seriously injured.

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,470
I couldn’t see things clearly at that time.

26
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,090
I had to release soul skills at random.

27
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,610
When I could see clearly,

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,010
they had already fallen to the ground.

29
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,720
Shrek School caused severe injuries

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,350
to students of Cang Hui School during the battle,
who is unconscious now.

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,410
I announce that

32
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,090
Shrek School is removed from this contest!

33
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,290
We’ll exempt this interrogation.

34
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,690
We’ll leave first.

35
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,510
That’s right. Shrek never fears any enemy.

36
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,990
Shrek, must win!

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,810
[Soul Land]
[Episode 79]

38
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,290
Both teams, get ready.
The battle starts now.

39
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,410
Attack!

40
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,250
<i>In prior to knowing the opponents’ abilities,</i>

41
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,510
let’s test by using the first soul skill first.

42
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,310
First soul skill, Intertwine.

43
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,330
First soul skill, Ice Bound.

44
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,130
<i>Her soul skill is amazing that
it can aim four people at the same time.</i>

45
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,050
<i>I’m restricted by the opponent now.</i>

46
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,830
<i>It’ll be hard for me
to control everyone precisely.</i>

47
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,590
Little San failed to restrict Shui Bing Er.

48
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,550
Instead, Shui Bing Er managed to restrict Little San.

49
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,970
<i>I’d withdraw Blue Silver Plant first,
and observe how it goes.</i>

50
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,550
Little San is forced to give up
Human Meteor Hammer for the first time.

51
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,230
Tian Shui School is indeed a strong opponent.

52
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,330
Brother, Shui Bing Er’s skill

53
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,110
seems to have restricted Little San.

54
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,090
Look at his embarrassing look.

55
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,330
Your Repelling Fire Ring can restrict
Shui Bing Er to a certain degree only.

56
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,150
Tian Shui School of this batch
is indeed strong,

57
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,210
especially Shui Bing Er and Xue Wu.

58
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,770
<i>I’d find a way to defeat the opponent’s
soul master of Controlling Branch.</i>

59
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,150
<i>At least, buy some time for Little San.</i>

60
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,270
Second soul skill,
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

61
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,150
Second soul skill, Ice Ring Armour.

62
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,710
<i>Team defense.</i>

63
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,430
<i>The Ice Ring Armour
can be enforced to her teammates.</i>

64
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,030
<i>What a powerful attack!</i>

65
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,890
<i>Ice Ring Armour can’t resist it anymore.</i>

66
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,590
Little San, it’s now!

67
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,670
Want to hide? It’s not easy.

68
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,670
Ice Bound.

69
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,790
It’s the first soul skill again.

70
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,690
She’s having priority
as her soul power is stronger.

71
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,790
How to break this passive circumstance?

72
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,810
<i>Jing Ling is a soul master of
Keen Attack Branch. He’s quick response.</i>

73
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,190
<i>Xiao Wu owns third soul skill of Teleport,</i>

74
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,770
<i>yet she can’t hide from it either.</i>

75
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,350
<i>Is this Soul Skill Lockdown?</i>

76
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,390
<i>Third soul skill, The Pressure Kill.</i>

77
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,270
Tai Long, hurry up! Amplify your power.

78
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,530
First soul skill, Firm Rock Defense.

79
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,490
He broke the Ice Bound.

80
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,590
First soul skill, Fish Transformation.

81
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,610
Second soul skill, Burst Enormous Power.

82
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,590
Second soul skill, Jade Wave.

83
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,610
<i>What a strong power!</i>

84
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,370
<i>Obviously, their attacks are weakened greatly.</i>

85
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,370
<i>But they still caused me severe injuries.</i>

86
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,670
<i>Her defense is as hard as an ice cube.</i>

87
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,250
<i>It can even resist my second soul skill.</i>

88
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,950
<i>As long as Tang San is being controlled,</i>

89
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,510
<i>Shrek’s tactics will be restricted as well.</i>

90
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,370
<i>And I can attack them one by one.</i>

91
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,210
<i>The victory will be ours soon.</i>

92
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,490
<i>What?</i>

93
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,910
<i>As there’s a concentrated focus,</i>

94
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,610
<i>there’ll be a neglected blind spot too.</i>

95
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,730
<i>You’ve just focused on me.</i>

96
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,190
<i>but you didn’t notice that my teammates</i>

97
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,730
<i>have already broken the Ice Bound.</i>

98
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,610
It’s still early to be happy. Xue Wu.

99
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,990
[Soul Land]

100
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,890
<i>As there’s a concentrated focus,</i>

101
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,670
<i>there’ll be a neglected blind spot too.</i>

102
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,550
<i>While you launched the tactics,</i>

103
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,030
<i>Xue Wu’s soul skill has been ready as well.</i>

104
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,390
<i>Tang San, how about the taste of your own medicine?</i>

105
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,310
<i>Is that satisfying for you?</i>

106
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,430
<i>Ice Snow that weakens the battle power.</i>

107
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,110
<i>The tool soul master
can even control the weather.</i>

108
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,630
<i>This snow is a soul skill
of General Support Branch.</i>

109
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,990
<i>However, it’s not supporting her teammates,</i>

110
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,190
<i>but it keeps exhausting
the opponents’ soul power</i>

111
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,510
<i>even the auditorium is encaged as well.</i>

112
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,870
We have no chance to win
if we keep going on like this.

113
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,790
Fourth soul skill, Blue Silver Cage.

114
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,390
<i>He is using massive soul power
to initiate the fourth soul skill.</i>

115
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,350
<i>Little San has to do in this way.</i>

116
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,890
<i>Now, they are fully suppressed.</i>

117
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,870
<i>Especially Jiang Zhu, she can’t resist it for long.</i>

118
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,830
<i>Even Blue Silver Cage can’t hinder her soul skill?</i>

119
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,430
First soul skill, Ice Bound.

120
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,410
<i>It’s Ice Bound again.</i>

121
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,050
<i>Shui Bing Er can initiate
her first soul skill instantly.</i>

122
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,790
<i>And once targeted by her soul skill,</i>

123
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,630
<i>we can’t escape.</i>

124
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,230
<i>It seems that I can</i>

125
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,120
<i>use an impulsive force of pulling back
the Blue Silver Cage</i>

126
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,330
<i>to break the Ice Bound.</i>

127
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,710
<i>This is the only feasible way for now.</i>

128
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,710
<i>Since it’s difficult to deal with
Xue Wu and Shui Bing Er...</i>

129
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,550
Mu Bai. Meteor Strike

130
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,610
binds with Blue Silver Cage

131
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,650
and attacks from both sides.

132
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,530
All right.

133
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,750
Fourth soul skill,
White Tiger Meteor Strike.

134
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,150
Great! The situation is reversed.

135
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,770
<i>How wise Tang San is.</i>

136
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,870
<i>He even attacks his own cage</i>

137
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,550
<i>as to weaken our team by the impulsive force.</i>

138
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,010
Four people of Tian Shui were attacked.

139
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,750
Is Tian Shui defeated?

140
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,730
Little San, hurry up!

141
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,150
First soul skill, Intertwine.

142
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,910
<i>It’s late. Third soul skill,
Repelling Light.</i>

143
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,910
<i>It’s similar to Huo Wu’s Repelling Fire Ring.</i>

144
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,250
<i>It breaks all of our skills instantly.</i>

145
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,130
<i>Moving forward?</i>

146
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,510
<i>No, she’s moving backwards.
What’s she doing?</i>

147
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,890
If you think of taking advantage of these girls,

148
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,270
you will be wrong.

149
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,190
Last time, I could barely blow them away by wind.

150
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,510
Boss,

151
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,930
I thought you were full of dirty thoughts.

152
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,770
You know nothing.

153
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,210
If I didn’t blow them away,

154
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,350
they would have...

155
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,490
fused!

156
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,750
It’s bad. It’s Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

157
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,350
Gather!

158
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,910
<i>They’ve been ready for this
Martial Soul Fusion Skill</i>

159
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,290
<i>since Little San is fully restricted by Shui Bing Er.</i>

160
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,950
Healing sceptre. Hurry up!

161
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,550
It’s radius attack!

162
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,070
Its attack scope is really exaggerated.

163
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,950
And its destructive power is really strong.

164
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,480
He even uses the Blue Silver Cage
that restricts the opponents

165
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,650
as self-defense.

166
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,050
Tang San’s tactics towards
the battle are really beyond expectation.

167
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,250
Martial Soul Fusion Skill that performs
by both Level 40 soul masters

168
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,510
is comparable with a Level 60 soul master.

169
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,990
Blue Silver Plant is tough,

170
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,730
but it’s just a vine
evolved from the grass. It can’t resist it.

171
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,830
Why can’t I see anything all of sudden?

172
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,370
What’s going on?
Who will win at the end?

173
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,440
Martial Soul Fusion Skill has been
hidden by Tian Shui School

174
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,770
in the preliminary.

175
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,310
They finally use it today.

176
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,390
Finally, someone can teach Little San a lesson.

177
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,390
But I still wish to defeat him by myself.

178
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,710
Don’t be anxious. To win or to lose is uncertain yet.

179
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,150
Although it’s a radius attack,

180
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,870
the power mainly focused on Tang San.

181
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,690
Let’s see if he can resist it.

182
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,910
There’s something amiss.

183
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,030
Why there are different degrees of defense
even with the same cage?

184
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,030
He can even...

185
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,790
<i>What a terrifying response of him!</i>

186
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,870
What happened?

187
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,570
Qibao Amber Tribe,
Three-Aperture Governing Heart.

188
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,350
<i>Little San, provide corresponding
assistance precisely</i>

189
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,930
<i>to the targets that require
different auxiliary effects.</i>

190
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,890
<i>This can further maximize the
auxiliary ability of Qibao Amber Pagoda.</i>

191
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,290
Little San can release so many Blue Silver Cages at once.

192
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,530
It doesn’t mean he has greatly
improved his soul power,

193
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,230
but his ability to use the soul power precisely,

194
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,510
while releasing each of his soul skills.

195
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,670
In other words, although those
Blue Silver Cages look similar,

196
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,970
it’s sturdier if using more soul power,

197
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,990
and weaker if using less soul power.

198
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,570
This saves much soul power.

199
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,550
Yes.

200
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,900
That’s why Little San can protect everyone

201
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,930
while encountering Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

202
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,050
If this carries on,
our soul powers will be depleted.

203
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,790
We couldn’t break Tang San’s defense formation.

204
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,190
It’s the Decade Millennium Soul Skill.

205
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,670
Though it’s only defense, it’s too powerful.

206
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,770
We did even use Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

207
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,150
If we can’t win in this tournament,

208
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,270
the reputation of
Tian Shui School will be ruined.

209
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,730
What’s happening?

210
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,170
This frozen ability is too powerful!

211
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,530
Go to initiate the defensive cover quickly.

212
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,110
It’s the Mighty Beast Soul, Ice Phoenix.

213
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,130
<i>Frozen Ice with Flying Phoenix.</i>

214
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,550
<i>She owns the top martial soul, Ice Phoenix.</i>

215
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,630
<i>The Ice Phoenix is
supported by both fusion partners.</i>

216
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,570
<i>We have no extreme strength.
How can we compete against them?</i>

217
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,570
<i>Extreme strength?</i>

218
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,990
<i>There’s only one method now.</i>

219
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,590
Our soul powers are exhausted greatly. Little San.

220
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,810
All of you get down first. I have my trump.

221
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,960
Brother, be careful.

222
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,950
<i>Ice Phoenix is a Mighty Beast Soul that
is comparable with Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.</i>

223
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,990
<i>I’m worried...</i>

224
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,850
<i>Ice Phoenix is indeed a Mighty Beast Soul.</i>

225
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,370
<i>Little San, can you resist it?</i>

226
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,610
Get away quickly. The Phoenix is too powerful.

227
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,830
I can’t control it anymore.

228
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,930
You’re such a kind girl.

229
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,010
But I can’t be defeated.

230
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,950
[Next Episode]
Can you tell me the reason?

231
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,170
Without Eight Spider Bone,

232
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,790
Without Fiery Soft Apricot and Octa Dark Frost,

233
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,270
Without Decade Millennium Soul Ring,

234
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,330
What else do I have?

235
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,870
Failure is the mother of success.

236
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,070
We’ve not lost,

237
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,950
but a step closer to the triumph.

238
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,030
Master,

239
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,910
Empire and Martial Soul Hall have
already reached an irreconcilable state.

240
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,030
It will certainly
become unpeaceful soon.

241
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,410
It’s been ten years already.
Do you finally admit your fate?
