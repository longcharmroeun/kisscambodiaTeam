00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
Shrek School wins

25
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,580
not with our popularity,
but with our strength.

26
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,360
Go for it!

27
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,340
Decade Millennium Soul Ring?

28
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,660
This is not a competition.

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
I wonder how the tournament

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
is going.

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,170
[Soul Land]
[Episode 70]

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,560
Uncle Ning, you are here.

33
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,180
Qing He, I told you this is unnecessary.

34
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,980
You are my master.

35
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,660
My father will be upset,
if I don’t mind my manner.

36
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,280
This must be Tang San
that you’ve given much praise.

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,240
Is Shrek School short of budget?

38
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,660
Tian Dou Empire can sponsor you.

39
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,630
It’s all right.

40
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,890
We are about to talk to our Dean
about this uniform.

41
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,980
Let me introduce you.

42
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,460
Little San, this is the Crown Prince
of Tian Dou Empire.

43
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,220
Prince Xue Qing He.

44
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,680
So His Highness is here.
Pardon my rudeness.

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,480
If Uncle Ning hadn’t told me,

46
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,900
it’s hard for me to believe
you are just a young man.

47
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,900
If you don’t mind,
you may address me as Brother Xue.

48
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,680
It’s all right if you don’t
address me as the prince.

49
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>Is this man here really
Xue Beng’s brother?</i>

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,620
<i>Their personalities are so different.</i>

51
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,300
All right, let’s sit down for now.

52
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,160
You are just in time to try out
the green tea.

53
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,860
Brother Xue.

54
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,240
I was told you have information about
my father’s disappearance.

55
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,120
He has always been an idol I admire.

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
I’ve been investigating it for years.

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,220
But all the clues are connected to one location.

58
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,320
What is the place?

59
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,860
Martial Soul Hall.

60
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,320
Back then, the higher-ups of
Martial Soul Hall were mobilized

61
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,320
just to search the whole land
for one treasure.

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,380
It’ rumored that the treasure
was in your father’s hand.

63
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,080
Soon after, your father withdrew himself
from the Hao Tian Tribe.

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,600
Perhaps, he didn’t want to involve his tribe.

65
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,800
Soon after, your father battled
the forces from Martial Soul Hall.

66
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
He left carrying injuries and
the treasure lost ever since.

67
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,580
And that very battle

68
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,440
made your father the youngest
Grand Soul Land Master.

69
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
After the battle,

70
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,040
the pope passed away
and the new pope took his place.

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
The Hao Tian Tribe slowly
faded from people’s attention.

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,480
Your father’s disappearance

73
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,220
must have been connected
to this incident as well.

74
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,820
What about my mother?

75
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,400
I am sorry, but I couldn’t get
information about your mother.

76
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,280
But Martial Soul Hall is powerful.

77
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,140
Their power is on par with two empires.

78
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,240
What could be the treasure
they are so obsessed with?

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,440
What happened during the battle?

80
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
If we could find the connection,

81
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,520
we can surely track down your parents.

82
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,740
If the previous pope
was killed by my father,

83
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,760
then it makes sense why my father
chose to raise me with an alias.

84
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,300
But my mother...

85
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,720
If it wasn’t a dream, Martial Soul Hall...

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,460
I will avenge my parents.

87
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,700
I’ve sent my men to investigate the case.

88
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,540
But it’s been years, many clues have been severed.

89
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,700
I doubt we could get any progress.

90
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,760
This information is more than enough for me.

91
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Thank you, Brother Xue.

92
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
You are most welcome. It’s getting late,

93
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,480
why don’t we have a meal together?

94
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,000
I’ll pass. I should train for the competition.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,720
In that case,

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
carry this token with you.

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,500
If anything happens,

98
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,740
carry it and come to me when you need help.

99
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,060
But...

100
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,940
This token is only Qing He’s personal token.

101
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,680
It serves no other purpose.

102
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Just accept it.

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Alright. I appreciate this, Brother Xue.

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,860
Brother Xue, Uncle Ning, I must go now.

105
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,080
Master, you are right. He is unique.

106
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,420
He lives up to the name of Hao Tian Tribe.

107
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,820
Hao Tian Tribe didn’t help him much.

108
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,280
He is already a soul master at Level 40
at such a young age.

109
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,240
If he could undo the rebound
caused by Twin Martial Soul,

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,420
he will certainly surpass his father.

111
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,080
He will become a legend.

112
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,000
I will keep investigating
his father’s disappearance.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
As for him,

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,300
he may be outstanding
but too inexperienced nonetheless.

115
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,330
I should just be friendly
for the time being.

116
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,930
Qing He, Tang San is loyal to his friends.

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,060
If you really wish to get his help,

118
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,240
you should never try to recruit him,

119
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,020
but become his true friend.

120
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,080
Master, I understand.
Thank you for enlightening me.

121
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,280
This is Shrek School that defeated
the Tian Dou Imperial School?

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,080
Their outfit is so “eye-catching”!

123
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,620
With their appearance,

124
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,700
even if they are a dark horse in this tournament,

125
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
I just can’t admire them at all.

126
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,400
Look at Shen Feng School and Lei Ting School.

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,100
And the strong Xiang Jia School.

128
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,800
They all look much cooler than these losers.

129
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,640
Shrek School is wearing green like manures.

130
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,600
Perhaps that represents good luck.

131
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,020
“Ever so charming, Qixiang Shampoo
for a healthier body!”

132
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,740
This is the Dean’s fault.
He got us this lousy advertisement.

133
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,700
This shampoo is considered
premium by the way.

134
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,780
Half of the shampoo businesses
in Tian Dou are theirs.

135
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,260
That’s why they paid
such a huge sum.

136
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,720
But this doesn’t change how
embarrassing this is.

137
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,540
If we keep winning,

138
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,320
we might get other weirder advertisements.

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,200
It could be a toilet advertisement next time.

140
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,000
No!

141
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:41,190
[Soul Land]

142
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,220
Dean is so stubborn.

143
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,520
Can Boss Dai alone
enough to persuade him?

144
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,580
Little San, you are the smart guy.
Figure something out.

145
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,400
Fine. Let’s observe for now.

146
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,200
Dean said the product placement must stay.

147
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,320
But if we agree on one condition,

148
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,260
he agrees

149
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,020
to change the uniform back
to the previous color.

150
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,280
What does he want?

151
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,300
He wants more share of
the advertisement payment.

152
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,680
He wants 80 percent.

153
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,760
He is so calculating, that stingy old man.

154
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,600
It can’t be helped.

155
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
He said the previous color didn’t
match the advertisement.

156
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,460
The contract will be difficult
if we change it.

157
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,940
The budget will be cut.

158
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,460
And he wants to hold us responsible
for the loss.

159
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,940
As long as we don’t need to wear
this green thing,

160
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,260
I can agree on anything.

161
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,960
Then get ready and get changed.

162
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,840
Grandmaster, what is the training you’ll give me?

163
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,240
There is a skill in Qibao Amber Tribe
called Heart Separation Control.

164
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,420
What is your level on that skill?

165
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,480
I managed to control the
Three-Aperture Governing Heart.

166
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,460
I think it’s enough for me to handle it.

167
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,300
There is the Three-Aperture Governing Heart,

168
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,880
Four-Aperture Fortitude,
and Five-Aperture Scattering,

169
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,240
Six-Aperture Will and Seven-Aperture Agility.

170
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Each of the stages

171
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,700
represents the number of skills
you can control at one time,

172
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,020
and the number of releases
you can make.

173
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,440
You’ve been training since a young age
yet made no progress,

174
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,500
how are you supposed to use
your Martial Soul to its maximum?

175
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,680
Master, Rong Rong is already at Level 40.

176
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
She is outstanding in supporting skills.

177
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,140
She can buff us for 50 percent
while controlling four other skills.

178
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,320
The impulse she has

179
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,540
can boost our strength to a whole new level.

180
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,500
Are you sure about that?

181
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
She can tell you the answer.

182
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,340
If the Shrek Seven Devils move out,

183
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,300
she buffs all six of you at the same time,

184
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,360
how long can she maintain it?

185
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Probably less than three seconds.

186
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Three seconds?

187
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,820
Grandmaster, how do you know the secrets
of Qibao Amber Tribe?

188
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,260
I was born in Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe.

189
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
One of the three greatest tribes.

190
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,300
I am not the only one who knows.

191
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,960
Most of the powerful soul masters

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
know about this.

193
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
Even so,

194
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,100
Qibao Amber Tribe is the most powerful
in terms of Supporting Branch.

195
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,200
That’s all thanks to the
Heart Separation Control.

196
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,420
You are right.

197
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,760
The secret of Qibao Amber Pagoda

198
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
is the use of soul power.

199
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,140
The stronger the soul power is,
the more soul rings we have,

200
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,760
the more prominent the side effect is.

201
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,640
This is a fair world.

202
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,180
Qibao Amber Pagoda is the best
Supporting Branch Martial Soul.

203
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,860
Its supporting ability is astonishing.

204
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,200
But it also takes a great toll
on the soul power.

205
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
If this issue isn’t solved properly,

206
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,220
when in face of stronger opponents,

207
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,180
Rong Rong will have trouble
using her potential to the greatest.

208
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,160
So the solution is Heart Separation Control?

209
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,480
The Hear Separation Control

210
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,300
is to control different skills
simultaneously to have effects.

211
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,940
During a battle,

212
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,240
every fighter will have
different needs for buffs.

213
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,400
With limited soul power,

214
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,900
you must support with precision
to each of your targets.

215
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,460
That is how you utilize the power
of Qibao Amber Pagoda to the greatest.

216
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,440
For example, among the four skills
Rong Rong has right now,

217
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,160
what I need the most is a buff to my soul power.

218
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,300
Boss Dai, on the other hand,
needs attack, defense and soul power boost.

219
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,080
Grandmaster, you are amazing.

220
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,660
What you said is just the same
as my father’s teaching.

221
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,540
But the training is so hard and boring, so I...

222
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,700
Rong Rong, as the direct heir of Qibao Amber Tribe,

223
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,260
you are born with the advantage.

224
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,960
You must hone your mastering of
Heart Separation Control.

225
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,260
Even if you will become
the Grand Soul Land Master,

226
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,660
you won’t be a qualified
soul master from Support Branch.

227
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,380
Do you understand my concern now?

228
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,460
Grandmaster, thank you.

229
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,380
I assure you that from now on,

230
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,300
I will train harder.

231
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,560
I am glad to hear that.

232
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,400
Rong Rong, I have other agenda
for asking Little San here.

233
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,660
If your tribe doesn’t forbid you
from teaching an outsider,

234
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,380
will you let Little San join your training

235
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,220
for the Heart Separation Control?

236
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,900
Master, that is a skill only
the Qibao Amber Tribe can use.

237
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,220
I can’t learn that.

238
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,720
Little San, you are a soul master
of Controlling Branch with Twin Martial Soul.

239
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,760
If you manage to master
Heart Separation Control,

240
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,560
you will gain more control on the battlefield.

241
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,940
After you acquire skills
for your second Martial Soul,

242
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,580
your power growth will become more prominent.

243
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,520
Brother San, we can train together.

244
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,700
We owe you a favour.

245
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,620
I believe my father would agree on this as well.

246
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
But...

247
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,800
Brother San.

248
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,100
When you gave me the Celestial Tulip,

249
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,010
did I ever turn you down?

250
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,770
I didn’t, because I do see you as
my big brother.

251
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Shrek Seven Devils are one family.

252
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,750
You have always been so selfless.

253
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,250
So I must repay your kindness as well.

254
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,660
How about this?
I’ll get permission from my father.

255
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,000
I am sure he won’t refuse it.

256
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,790
She is always so rash.

257
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,350
Little San, don’t worry.
Ning Feng Zhi will seize

258
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,640
this chance to get a favor.

259
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,100
As the Chief of Qibao Amber Tribe,
he has a vision.

260
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,340
He holds both you and your father in high regard.

261
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,580
Now tell me,

262
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,520
what Ning Feng Zhi talked to you about?

263
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,620
Shrek School.

264
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,780
Your unsightly defeat

265
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,260
shall bring glory to the Martial Soul Hall.

266
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,170
[Next Episode]

267
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,620
I suggest you surrender on the next round.

268
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,740
Your opponents for the next round will be...

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,160
He failed to make friends,
so he chose to oppress.

270
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,840
To battle!
