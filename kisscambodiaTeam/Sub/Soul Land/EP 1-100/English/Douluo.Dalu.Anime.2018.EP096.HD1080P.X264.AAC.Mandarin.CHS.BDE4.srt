[Previous Episode]
Since you decided

24
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,310
to assassinate Tang San
without empathizing my feelings,

25
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,730
the affection between us had ended.

26
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,190
Yu Xiao Gang, since I can’t have you,

27
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,380
I’ll destroy everything that you care about.

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,660
Xiao Wu!

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,790
Tomorrow is the first round of the final

30
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,800
of the tournament.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,550
Seven of you will duel together this time.

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,310
Martial Soul Hall,
I’ll definitely settle it with you.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 96]

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,390
Dean, who is our opponent in the first round?

35
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,820
One bad news and one good news.

36
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,290
Which one do you prefer to listen to first?

37
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,420
Bad news first.

38
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,960
The bad news is

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,920
your opponent is Chi Huo School.

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,920
Why is Chi Huo again?

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,900
What are the odds?

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,690
Frander, what about the good news?

43
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,820
Right, what about it?

44
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,500
The good news is

45
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,680
Chi Huo School gave up the finals.

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
What?

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,940
So, we’ve skipped the first two rounds.

48
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,910
Are we entering the top ten without dueling?

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,740
Huo Wu had fought fiercely
in the qualifying rounds.

50
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,220
How could she give up so early?

51
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,790
The fight between Shen Feng School
and Long Kui School is going to begin.

52
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,660
Please be on the field.

53
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,930
What?

54
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,930
- This...
- How could it be?

55
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,350
Why did students from Chi Huo School

56
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,560
and Shen Feng appear together?

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,250
What’s going on?

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,780
I’m going to ask the committee.

59
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,140
Sister Huo Wu, regarding things about us...

60
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,500
Get on the cart.

61
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,260
Brother Feng, I called you

62
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,860
as I have something to discuss with you.

63
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,300
Sister Huo Wu, do we have to

64
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,050
be so polite to each other?

65
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,290
Do you think we can defeat Shrek

66
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,820
only by Chi Huo School

67
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,660
or Shen Feng School?

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,750
It’s hard.

69
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,170
Do you want a breakthrough?

70
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,260
Chi Huo School and Shen Feng School

71
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
combine to become New Shen Feng.

72
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,040
New Shen Feng?

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,740
I’ll negotiate with the committee.

74
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,440
As for you, you just have
to communicate with your members.

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,060
Brother Feng, will you promise me?

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,320
How can I refuse?

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
Sister Huo Wu.

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,240
Whether you wish to win in the finals

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,510
or you just want to defeat Tang San,

80
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,770
I’ll definitely help you.

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,150
The committee approved
their personnel transfer.

82
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,780
As expected.

83
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,180
They went around the rules.

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,840
It doesn’t allow schools to change
their participants during the fight.

85
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,350
But this doesn’t mean participants
can’t change their school temporarily.

86
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,520
Martial Soul Hall must have
a secret agreement with New Shen Feng.

87
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,900
Hence, they allowed New Shen Feng to do so.

88
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,010
Darn it.

89
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,220
Wouldn’t it be difficult if we encounter them

90
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,530
in the future?

91
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,000
Please remain silent.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,740
Let’s look at both team’s fighting position.

93
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,720
We can see that

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,220
the distribution of the combat power
of Long Kui School is even.

95
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,910
It’s a conservative formation.

96
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,190
While New Shen Feng’s formation
is more aggressive.

97
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,760
It shows that Shen Feng is full of confidence.

98
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,250
Long Kui has four Soul Sects,
and they distribute evenly.

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,850
It seems like Long Kui

100
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,520
is going to fight firmly.

101
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,780
All Shen Feng members have reached
the level of Soul Sect.

102
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,490
With such a strong lineup,

103
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,300
can Long Kui fight with them?

104
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,150
Brother, Brother Feng. Settle them quickly.

105
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,900
I hereby announce,
Shen Feng School versus Long Kui School,

106
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,020
starts

107
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,450
now.

108
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,780
Second soul skill,
Blazing Flames Burning Lights.

109
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,630
It’s too powerful.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
One more.

111
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,020
Fourth soul skill, Stormy Sand.

112
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,540
<i>That was close.</i>

113
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,810
Third soul skill, Vertigo Aroma.

114
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,690
<i>I can’t avoid it.</i>

115
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,180
<i>Got him.</i>

116
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,540
Wind.

117
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,380
Fire.

118
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,490
<i>Darn it. Leader and I can’t fight over them.</i>

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,820
Victory belongs to us anyhow.

120
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,250
Third soul skill, Gale Wings.

121
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,260
First soul skill, Threadlike Sparks.

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,130
Fourth soul skill, Menacing Waves of Clouds.

123
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,610
<i>No, that’s a feint. His target is...</i>

124
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,140
<i>How cunning.</i>

125
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,980
Third soul skill, Coagulate...

126
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,190
Right now.

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,490
When did...

128
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,050
Did they win?

129
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,160
Isn’t this too fast?

130
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,480
Did they pass three strokes?

131
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,390
Is this the strength of New Shen Feng?

132
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,700
Shen Feng School won.

133
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,250
Feng Xiao Tian only used three soul skills.

134
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,610
Huo Wu Shuang used two soul skills.

135
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,200
While Huo Wu didn’t even use her first soul skill.

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,740
Even though there’s a slight gap
between both teams,

137
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,160
but Shen Feng defeated their rivals

138
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
within a few minutes.

139
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,030
This happens rarely in finals.

140
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,590
I wonder who are our next opponents.

141
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,230
Could it be New Shen Feng?

142
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,770
[Soul Land]

143
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,700
Next round, Xing Luo Imperial School.

144
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,800
Xing Luo?

145
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,850
<i>Xing Luo.</i>

146
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,630
The seeded soul masters from Xing Luo Empire.

147
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,700
Their strength should not be underestimated.

148
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,790
Boss Dai, what’s wrong?

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,150
I know that it’s important

150
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,050
for you to reserve your strength.

151
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,630
But I’d like to request everyone

152
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,110
to do your best in this round.

153
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,940
For Mu Bai and me,

154
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,510
this isn’t just a battle of soul skills.

155
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,510
but

156
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,550
a life-and-death duel.

157
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,850
Welcome the first match in the third round

158
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,880
of the finals.

159
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,310
Shrek School

160
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,860
versus Xing Luo Imperial School.

161
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,830
Now standing on the field is Shrek School.

162
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,200
They didn’t join the
first two rounds in the finals.

163
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,450
How would they perform today?

164
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,100
How far can they go?

165
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,920
Let’s wait and see.

166
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,650
Now here comes Xing Luo Imperial School Team.

167
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,500
As the best seed of Xing Luo Empire,

168
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,260
what surprise will they

169
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,170
bring to us today?

170
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,990
Mu Bai, I’ve never expected
you can reach the finals.

171
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,450
But you should know that

172
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,180
it’ll make my desire stronger to attack you.

173
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,290
Dai Wei Si, stop being pretentious.

174
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,790
When have you ever stopping striking me?

175
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,040
Today, we’re enemies.

176
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,430
Oh, our playboy has changed.

177
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,350
How dare you talk so rudely to me?

178
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,380
<i>It seems like their relations</i>

179
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,700
<i>are worse than what Boss Dai described.</i>

180
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,480
Their situation

181
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,310
is totally different from Yu Tian Xin
and Yu Tian Heng.

182
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,870
The competition between Yu brothers is healthy.

183
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,930
But theirs are cruel.

184
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,070
Because of their tribe’s rules,

185
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,290
losers are not worthy of living.

186
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,360
I didn’t expect that Zhu Qing
followed you to Tian Dou Empire.

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,770
Are you going
to fight us till the end?

188
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,520
Give up, Brother. You’ve lost.

189
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,950
Not yet.

190
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,970
Brother, you’re just my junior forever.

191
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:30,160
Second soul skill,
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

192
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,590
For Zhu Qing, I will not run away anymore.

193
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,270
Zhu Qing, you’ve reached top ten
in the finals. Just end here.

194
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,760
Dad and Mom miss you a lot.

195
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,210
But they can’t go against the tribe’s rules.

196
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,680
Go back with me after this tournament.

197
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,610
Zhu Zhu Yun, stop being pretentious.

198
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,610
If I didn’t leave home,

199
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,990
I might have been killed by you.

200
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,580
They miss me?

201
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,740
Does such affection

202
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,870
exist in our family?

203
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,490
My life would be under your control.

204
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,950
Zhu Qing, what are you saying?

205
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,570
They are all aggressive in the first meeting.

206
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,740
All participants, please be ready.

207
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,430
Now, let’s look at their information.

208
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,950
Friends, initiate our martial souls.
Give them a surprise.

209
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,350
Well, I wonder what you’ve learnt

210
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,150
after leaving home.

211
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,150
[Dai Mu Bai]
All members of Shrek are Soul Sects.

212
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,860
[Zhu Zhu Qing]

213
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,700
Besides, this is a well-prepared team.

214
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
[Ma Hong Jun]
They’re difficult to deal with.

215
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
[Oscar]

216
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,790
There is a new face

217
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,090
[Ning Rong Rong]
in Shrek’s team,

218
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,580
she has been hiding her strength since then.

219
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,710
[Xiao Wu]
Is she the trump of Shrek?

220
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,000
[Tang San]
Tang San, as a soul master of Control Branch,

221
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
stands at the second row.

222
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,670
He’s still being prudent as usual.

223
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,470
Let’s look at
Xing Luo Imperial School’s information.

224
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,790
Dai Wei Si, captain of Xing Luo Imperial School

225
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,150
has reached Level 49.

226
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,050
[Da Wei Si]
Just one more step to be a Soul King.

227
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,710
Dai Wei Si and Zhu Zhu Yun
as the strongest members of the team

228
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,960
[Zhu Zhu Yun]
stand in the first row. What an aggressive aura.

229
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,060
Are they going to defeat Shrek

230
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,120
with their advanced soul power?

231
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,120
[Dong Hui]           [Yang Ming Ming]
Besides,

232
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,870
in the team,

233
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,170
two members whose soul powers
ranked the third and fourth

234
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,520
[Tang Hong Ning]

235
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,270
is similar to Dai Mu Bai,
the strongest soul power in Shrek.

236
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,680
[Ying Wei]

237
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,790
In Xing Luo Imperial School’s formation,

238
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,230
they stand in three rows.
Constructive for attacking and defence.

239
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,070
It seems like they have full confidence.

240
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,110
Are you looking forward to

241
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,530
this exciting match?

242
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,710

243
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,830
Shrek School versus

244
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,750

247
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,320
Zhu Zhu Qing and Zhu Zhu Yun,

248
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,350
have the same Martial Souls?

249
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,200
We’ll deal with Dai Wei Si and Zhu Zhu Yun.

250
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,130
Mu Bai, it’s been a long time.

251
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,100
Today, I’ll teach you a lesson.

252
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,230
Let’s duel first.

253
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,650
I’ll settle you then.

254
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,470
Strategy adjustment.
We’ve underestimated them.

255
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,390

Nether Fantasy.

262
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,380
The assassin was indeed you.

263
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,060
Which occasion are you talking about?

264
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,910
Stop resisting. You’re the next.
