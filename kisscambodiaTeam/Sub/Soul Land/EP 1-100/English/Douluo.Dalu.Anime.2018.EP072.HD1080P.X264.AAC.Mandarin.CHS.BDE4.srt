[Previous Episode]

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,140
Why did Martial Soul Hall turn all out for it?

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,640
Yet they returned with nothing,

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,240
and even might lose their pope.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,010
If it’s a soul bone,
Martial Soul Hall wouldn’t lose.

Diamond Mammoth.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 72]

31
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,280
I heard that the captain of
Elephant Armoured School Team

32
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,180
has some relations with Chief Huyan.

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,780
Li is the most outstanding one among
all youths in Elephant Armoured Tribe.

34
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,210
He’s my eldest grandson.

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,480
His innate talent is even better than mine.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,660
I’m hoping he can be the first

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,760
Grand Soul Land Master in my tribe.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,160
Congrats Chief Huyan for having such a grandson.

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,610
Our tribe aims to get top three in finals.

41
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,740
For now, let’s see how he performs today.

42
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,940
However,

43
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,910
your grandson is battling with

44
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,480
four soul sects above Level 40 this time.

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,610
One of them has possessed a 10,000 aged soul ring.

46
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,410
He is Tang San, right?

47
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,010
Chief Ning.

48
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,080
Do you know who could
teach such a brilliant disciple?

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,910
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,240
do you remember the Golden Iron Triangle?

51
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,140
They’re now in charge of Shrek School.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,140
The dean, Frander is the Flying Vertex.

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,140
These kids are taught by
the Wisdom Vertex, Master.

54
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,740
He’s the only direct disciple of Grandmaster.

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,140
Grandmaster? How could it be him?

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Chief Salas,

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
do you know him too?

58
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,880
No one hasn’t heard of the Golden Iron Triangle.

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,380
Martial Soul Hall and Grandmaster are well-connected.

60
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,240
I never expected that he went to Shrek School.

61
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,540
No wonder those young students
are very outstanding.

62
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,780
<i>Salas thinks highly of himself,</i>

63
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,340
<i>why is he shocked upon hearing
Grandmaster’s name?</i>

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,080
<i>It must be something behind it.</i>

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,780
Since both of you think highly of this Grandmaster,

66
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,980
I’d like to meet him in person.

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,080
Let’s watch the game now.

68
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,140
Preliminary second round, first match.

69
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,010
Shrek School versus Elephant Armoured School,
officially begins!

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
First soul skill.

71
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,280
Impregnable Fortress.

72
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,740
Retreat.

73
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,980
First soul skill, Intertwine.

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,680
Brother San’s Blue Silver Plant is tough.

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,980
How could he break it so easily?

76
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,210
It seems like their strength is
beyond our expectation.

77
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,380
Moreover,

78
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,140
apart from having powerful strength,

79
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,940
they’re so good at using their merits.

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,410
They use their physical strength
to replace the consumption of soul power.

81
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,310
Furthermore, combining soul power
and physical strength

82
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,010
to stimulate more powerful strength.

83
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,810
Even though Blue Silver Plant is tough,

84
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,810
but a small amount of winding
can’t restrict their movement.

85
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,810
<i>I didn’t expect that Shrek has several Soul Sects.</i>

86
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,510
<i>So, it’d be better to attack soundly,</i>

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,810
<i>instead of acting impulsively.</i>

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,080
<i>What we have to do now is
to maintain this formation.</i>

89
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,040
<i>If we could take down those
aren’t from Keen Attack Branch,</i>

90
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,110
<i>we’ll win.</i>

91
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,210
<i>The more space they occupy,</i>

92
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
<i>the more power they can exert.</i>

93
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,810
Little San, right now!

94
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,240
Advance, three steps.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,010
First soul skill, Intertwine.

96
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,910
I know this.

97
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,610
<i>This formation derives from Meteor Hammer.</i>

98
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,540
<i>With the help of Blue Silver Plant</i>

99
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,110
<i>to control their movement precisely.</i>

100
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,980
<i>I name this Human Meteor Hammer.</i>

101
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,280
Little Ao.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,980
Third soul skill,
Flying Mushroom Sausage.

103
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:13,780
Lighten yourselves.

104
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,340
Xuan Tian Strike,
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon.

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Tang San has a flying ability as well?

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,340
I’d say this ability comes from
the assisting soul master.

107
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,340
<i>That’s why that sturdy
Supreme Orangutan was replaced.</i>

108
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,880
<i>This is what he aimed to do.</i>

109
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,480
<i>With this formation,</i>

110
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,510
<i>everyone lightens their body
within the weight</i>

111
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,210
<i>that the Flight Mushroom Sausage could cater.</i>

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,640
<i>Tai Long is too heavy.</i>

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,480
<i>Otherwise, he could do better</i>

114
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>than Xiao Wu with this strategy.</i>

115
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,140
<i>How come they’re airborne soul masters?</i>

116
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,609
<i>Since flying in the sky,</i>

117
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
<i>they could avoid our strong defensive bodies,
and directly attack our heads.</i>

118
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,910
<i>They even disrupt our pace
for attacking.</i>

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,980
<i>This Tang San...</i>

120
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,110
Brother, should we use that skill?

121
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,040
No.

122
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,610
No way.

123
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,140
that’s for dueling with Shen Feng School.

124
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,680
They must have greater attack tactics behind.

125
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,740
Don’t panic, maintain our formation.

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,080
<i>Their formation is well-guarded.
I’ve no chance to use the fourth soul skill.</i>

127
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
<i>Air combat is indeed our only weakness,</i>

128
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,110
<i>but we’re invincible when it comes to defence.</i>

129
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,780
<i>Let’s see who will start first.</i>

130
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,440
Little Ao.

131
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,540
Brother, come up here.

132
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,240
Childish,

133
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,210
you only know how to evade us.

134
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,280
Why don’t you call yourselves as Tortoise School?

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,440
Secret snack.

136
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,580
Brother.

137
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,480
Darn it!

138
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,780
What a fool.

139
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,510
Forget about Shen Feng School. Set up the fort!

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,110
Mammoth Spiral Bomb.

141
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,210
Load.

142
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,940
Speed up, turbo charge.

143
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,680
What are they doing?

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,880
<i>Oh no!</i>

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Fire.

146
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,110
Boss Dai, block it!

147
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,910
White Tiger Protection Barrier.

148
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,810
I can’t stand such a strong power.

149
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,180
Trigonal Defense, please.

150
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,110
First, defence break.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,310
[Soul Land]

152
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,340
Xuan Yu Hand.

153
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,180
Right now.

154
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,980
Second shot, sneaky attack.

155
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,380
What a little devil.

156
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,780
How dare he takes
the blade wheel barehanded.

157
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,140
Mammoth Wheel isn’t that simple.

158
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,440
His hand is beyond recovery.

159
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,010
Dismantle the blade wheel.

160
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,310
Controlling Crane Catching Dragon,

161
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,710
Four Liang Lifting A Thousand Jin.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,240
It’s quite tough to take down the blade wheel.

163
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,940
Watch out!

164
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,140
Mammoth Triple Bomb.

165
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,510
Bring Tang San

166
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,080
out!

167
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,240
Lock him down.

168
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,880
<i>Darn it, I can’t move.</i>

169
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,110
Great! Right now!

170
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,810
No! It’s Huyan Li.

171
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,920
Come on, Brother.

172
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,840
Bash him, Li!

173
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,310
Go to hell!

174
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,340
How could you be so foolish?

175
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,840
Oh, that time.

176
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Secret snack.

177
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,480
Taste good?

178
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,040
I want to kill you.

179
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,440
No, save Brother.

180
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,840
Second soul skill, Parasite.

181
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,340
This...

182
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,040
These seeds are actually

183
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,340
when we were fighting...

184
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,610

191
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,980

strength amplification.</i>

192
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,780

strength type as well.</i>

193

199
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,040

200
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,940

how could you use that tiny booger
to ruin my perfect plan?

205
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,210
He has lost his mind.

206
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,910
Xiao Wu!

207
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,340
I can’t stand this shame...

208
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,240
Where’s she?

209
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,280
Look here.

210
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,680
Let’s attack together!

211
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,140
Beat him!

212
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,910
Brother,

213
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,880

214
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,380
This hit is really terrifying.

215
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,740
Huyan Li is in danger.

216
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,380

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,280
<i>What a tough face.</i>

218
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,540
Chief Huyan, it seems like you’ve broken the rules.

219
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,880
I don’t get you, Chief Ning.

220
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,680
What have I done?

221
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,540
<i>What did he tell his grandson?</i>

222
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,810

No.

228
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,910
This...

229
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,780
A helmet?

230
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,740
No, it’s a skull bone.

231
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,580
What the heck? Aren’t contestants allowed
to use implement?

232
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,980
Poor thing, this is a soul bone.

233
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Having such a skull bone at this young age,

234
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,840
your grandson is really outstanding.

235
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,680
Is your attack ending here?

236
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,010
It’s our turn then.

237
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,480

<i>Zhu Qing.</i>

241
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,280
<i>My legs are immobilised.</i>
