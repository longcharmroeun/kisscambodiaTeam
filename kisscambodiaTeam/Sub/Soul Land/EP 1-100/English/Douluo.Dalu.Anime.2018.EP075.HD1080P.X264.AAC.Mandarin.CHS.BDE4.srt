your biggest rivals are those Five Elements Schools.

It is the fused stream of

extreme individuals and balanced teams.

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,800

Xiao Wu, is Little San feeling better now?

He’s still unconscious.

50
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,420
But his condition has become more stable.

51
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,740
I think he should be okay.

52
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,540
Great. I shall have my meal first.

53
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,420
By the way, Grandmaster said that after Little San is awake,

54
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,000
he wants to see him.

55
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,380
I’m okay now, I’ll go and see Master.

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,380
Yesterday, did someone attack you?

59
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,880
Tell me in detail.

60
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,140
It’s Shi Nian from Cang Hui School.

61
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,320
Nightmare Shi Nian?

62
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,179
Yes.

63
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,259
He has let you go?

64
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,760
Shi Nian is always cruel.

65
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,800
Moreover, he has a unique Martial Soul.

66
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,000
Whether to attack or escape,

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,060
his opponent is at a disadvantage.

68
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,720
He’s dead.

69
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,460
I killed him with the Yama’s Invitation.

70
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,660
Besides, I’ve got his soul bone.

71
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,960
Hurry and show me.

72
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,100
You’ve got this soul bone,

73
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,080
yet you still remember what I’ve said.

74
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
You didn’t absorb it immediately.

75
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,820
This shows that you have
an extraordinary temperament.

76
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,120
Now I can rest assured.

77
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,140
After this contest, I’ll let you graduate.

78
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,980
Don’t tell anyone about Shi Nian’s incident,

79
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,840

[Soul Land]

81
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,300
Shi Nian is missing.
But it has nothing to do with you.

82
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,080
Even for this soul bone. Do you understand?

83
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,620
Yes, Master. What is the use of this soul bone?

84
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,040
This soul bone should be
under the jewel category.

85
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,820
It’s suitable for soul masters
of Support Branch and Illusion type.

86
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,300
Thus, it doesn’t suit you.

87
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,460
Ideally,

88
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,680
we can use it to trade for a suitable soul bone.

89
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,940
What kind of soul bone will suit me?

90
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,960
Soul bones of Plant Branch
and Strength Branch will do.

91
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,200
Soul bones of Plant Branch
is certainly beneficial for you.

92
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,100
As for soul bones of Strength Branch,
it will strengthen your body.

93
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,360
So that you can withstand higher pressure.

94
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,760
This is also a preparation
for your second Martial Soul.

95
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,800
Then when can I trade this soul bone?

96
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,060
Don’t worry.

97
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,720
Soul bone is a sensitive issue
among the soul masters.

98
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,520
If you’re not powerful enough,

99
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,080
you can’t trade for a suitable soul bone,

100
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,440
you may even lose your life.

101
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,440

102
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
a guard was killed at Tian Dou Auction.

103
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,220
The treasure is gone.
There is no fatal wound on the body.

104
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,080
But it seems like

105
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
he has suffered before death.

106
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,060
It may be Shi Nian’s doings.

107
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,280
Do you mean that

108
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,660
this is the stolen auction item
of Tian Dou Auction?

109
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,920
We can’t pass this soul bone
to Tian Dou Auction.

110
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,980
Or else you’ll be suspected for
killing the guard and stealing the item.

111
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,040
The death of Shi Nian may be investigated too.

112
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,300
Forget about what happened today.

113
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,120
Understand, Master.

114
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,880
If your father is here,

115
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,380
no one can harm you.

Is it the one like the
Elephant Armoured School,

126
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,620
it’s also one of the Five Elements Schools?

127
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,500
As expected,

128

the extreme faction is starting to overcome
their weaknesses with their strengths.

129
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,180

133
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,780
Their teamwork will be ingenious.

134
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,900
Their abilities may be higher than
Elephant Armoured School.

135
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,040
If you can’t do this, you’d better give up.

136
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,720
There’s no need to be persistent.

137
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,700
Since this is just a preliminary.

138
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,600
Even if Chi Huo School is very powerful,

139
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,300
we should give it a try too.

140
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
There’s no harm if we lose.

141
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,780

I’ve not joined this tournament

154
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,660
It can be considered as I’ve achieved my dream.

Grandmaster, what about Dean Frander?

156
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,940
Frander? He needs to settle the new sponsorship.

157

He has no time for tactical analysis
before the battle.

158
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,220
You’ve changed your uniform and your
advertisement fees have reduced by half.

159

Frander blamed these on me and
wants me to be responsible for it.

- Chi Huo.
- Chi Huo School is famous for fire

182
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
and their attack.

183
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,620
The two Storm Attack Branch soul masters
should not be looked down on.

184
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,320
Shrek School has used the same
guarding formation as before.

185
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,940
I wonder how they will
fight against Chi Huo this time.

186
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,220
Let’s take a look at the members.

187
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,460
I hereby announce, the eleventh
preliminary will start in...

188
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,740
Three, two, one.

189
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,500
Start!

190
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,760
If your Controlling Branch soul master
is not a Plant Branch,

191
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,700
maybe you’ll have a chance to win.

192
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,120
But now...

193
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,779
We’ll wait and see then.

194
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,160
<i>That being said, but Little San...</i>

195
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,099
First soul skill.

196
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,539
Threadlike Sparks.

197
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,860
<i>This team has great teamwork.</i>

198
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
<i>At the very beginning,</i>

199
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,280
<i>they’re building up their superiority.</i>

200
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,790
[Next Episode]

201
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,420
What a good support and control.

202
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,680
Gosh, I’m being tricked.

203
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,860
It’s a double trap.

204
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,660
Tang San, you’re the only one left now.

205
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,300
Grandmaster.

206
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,580
Our opponents are too powerful,

207
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,980
it’s hard for us to win.

208
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,020
Are you trying to perform suicide?

209
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
You’ve come just in time.

210
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,520
You’re indeed powerful, yet...

211
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,580
It’s over, Tang San.

212
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,760
The victory is ours.

213
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,940
Skip the next match.
