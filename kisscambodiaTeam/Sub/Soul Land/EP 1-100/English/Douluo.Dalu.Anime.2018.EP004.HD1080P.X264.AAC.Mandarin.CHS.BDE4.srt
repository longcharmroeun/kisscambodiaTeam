[Previous Episode] I’ll give the
apprentice position to Little San this year.

21
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,920
Don’t stop him...

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,600
from becoming a soul master.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Come and look for me if you change your mind.

before the registration starts.

00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,180
Remember,

29
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,100
you must protect your plant with the hammer.

30
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,250

Don’t let others know that
you have Twin Martial Souls.

Can...

35

[Episode 4]

40
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,140
Little San,

41
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,440
I’ll leave after sending you to the school.

42
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,790
You must listen to the teachers,

43
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,760
don’t leave the school without permission.

44
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,940
When the term ends, I’ll come and fetch you.

45
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,170
You’re leaving so soon, Grandpa Jack?

46
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,260
We can’t afford a hotel here.

47
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,280
<i>- This way please, Mister.</i>
- You must put efforts into it.

48
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,780
When I meet you next time,

49
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,510
I hope you’re already a soul master.

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
The whole Soul Saint Village
will be so proud of you.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,310
I will, Grandpa Jack.

52
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,070
Good boy.

53
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,190
Fine fresh fruit selling cheap!

54
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,220
Special sale! Fine fresh fruit!

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,120
What would like to buy?

56
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,340
Excuse me, how do I go to Nuoding School?

57
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,260
Just go straight to the end.

58
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,720
Oh, thank you.

59
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,230
Mister, what would you like?

60
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,510
Don’t worry.

61
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,300
Didn’t I tell you before? Look.

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
Excuse me, how do I go to Dorm Seven?

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,430
Dorm Seven is at...

64
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,670
We don’t know!

65
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,860
What? Does she have to be so rude?

66
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,930
Let’s go.

67
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,720
What are you doing?

68
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,990
Are villagers even allowed to be here?

69
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,460
I’m sorry.

70
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,200
I’m late.

71
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,350
Little brother, we come from
the Soul Saint Village.

72
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,540
He’s the apprentice from our village this year.

73
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,510
Are there any procedures to follow?

74
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,920
Someone is trying to aim at the moon here.

75
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,310
Even a villager can have soul power?

76
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,190
It has been years since we had an apprentice.

77
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,070
You’re not fakers, are you?

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,480
This is the letter from the officer
of Martial Soul Temple, Su Yun Tao.

79
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,220
Blue Silver Plant but has full soul power?

80
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,200
Funny, that’s hilarious.

81
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,280
I’ve been working here in the school
for four years,

82
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,910
and I’ve never heard of a student
born with full soul power before.

83
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,160
Let me guess, you fake this letter.

84
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,290
You!

85
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,570
You’re making things difficult for us!

86
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,980
Alright, you wait here.

87
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,870
I’ll look for the officer
from Martial Soul Branch Hall.

88
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,140
Little San, let’s go.

89
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,370
Soul Saint Village,
I think Beggars Village suits you more.

90
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,000
What did you say?

91
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,670
What? You don’t agree?

92
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,310
I said you come from Beggars Village.

93
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,360
Am I wrong?

94
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,710
Look at you, all poor and pathetic.

95
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,440
Get lost!

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
Go somewhere else if you want to beg.

97
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,430
Nuoding School isn’t
a charity association. Get lost!

98
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,180

107
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,790
can you show me the letter
from Martial Soul Temple?

108

It’s genuine.

110
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,780
I apologize on behalf of the school
on what happened just now.

111
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,580
Hand this kid to me.

112
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,360
There’s no need to say sorry.

113
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,920
We’re at fault too.
I’ll leave this kid to you then.

Teacher? I’m not a teacher here.

122
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,140
You’re not? Didn’t you say that
on behalf of the school?

123
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,100
Who said that only teachers
can represent the school?

124
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,160
I got it.

125
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,950
You must be the Dean,

126
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,850
or leader.

127
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,940
You’re indeed a smart kid.

128
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,430
But, wrong guess.

129
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,540
You are...

130
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,620
I’m just a guest here who enjoys free meals.

131
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,990
You can call me “Grandmaster” as everyone else does.

132
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,960
Everyone here calls me the same,

133
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,980
I even have forgotten my name.

134
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,300
The letter states that your name is Tang San?

135
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,190
Tang San, you must understand.

136
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,720
Grandmaster and teacher has big differences,

137
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,230
don’t get it wrong next time.

138
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,280
Unless you really want me to be your Master.

139
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,510
Are you going to teach me Martial Soul training?

140
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,580
Are you willing to learn?

141
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,200
Great, you’re indeed a smart kid.

142
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,250
Gifted and clever.

143
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,980
It seems like I need to be persistent this time.

144
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,910
Since you’re the third person who has
Twin Martial Souls in this century.

145
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>First rules of the Tang Clan’s Xuan Tian Records,</i>

146
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,380
<i>never allow someone you can’t fully trust...</i>

147
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,190
<i>to know your exact capability.</i>

148
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,680
You might ask, why I know
you have Twin Martial Souls.

149
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,090
Because of this letter.

150
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,950
I’ve investigated 647 people
with Blue Silver Plant.

151
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,350
Only 16 of them have soul powers.

152
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,420
Among them, none has more than
a Level 1 soul power,

153
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,880
but your soul power is at Level 10.

154
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,480
According to one of the
10 Core Competing Power of Martial Soul,

155
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,400
comparing your soul power amount
and Martial Soul’s quality,

156
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,340
Blue Silver Plant clearly can’t satisfy it.

157
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,180
So I’m pretty sure...

158
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,250
that you have another Martial Soul,

159
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,190
and a very strong one.

160
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,740
There’s always an exception.

161
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,180
Why can’t I be the one?

162
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,900
You’re right, there’s always an exception.

163
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,470
In these hundred years, even if
Tian Dou and Xing Luo Empires...

164
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,700
only have 2 people with Twin Martial Souls,

165
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,470
but there are 19 born with full soul power.

166
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,360
I’ve gone through each of their Martial Souls,

167
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,050
and all of them are strong masters.

168
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,830
Even the youngest one...

169
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,420
has reached the level of Great Soul Master.

170
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,310
There are still five who are exceptional.

171
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,500
They have Mutated Martial Souls.

172
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,030
Well, according to my research
on Mutated Martial Soul for years,

173
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,950
none of them mutated with Blue Silver Plant.

174
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,380
Since your Blue Silver Plant is just a normal one,

175
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,760
that’s why, I’m positive that...

176
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,630
my prediction is right.

177
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,910
Mutated Martial Soul, what’s that?

178
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,830
That has to begin from
the inheritance of Martial Soul.

179
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,340
Under normal situation,

180
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,340
we’ll inherit one of our parents’ Martial Soul.

181
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,910
But some might be exceptional.

182
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,610
Mutated Martial Soul can be much stronger,

183
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,300
some even born with full soul power.

184
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,340
But most of the Mutated Martial Soul...

185
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,350
will only be weaker.

186
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,790
Mutated Martial Soul is just like
the product of near-kin marriage,

187
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,120
there’s a big possibility of getting retarded.

188
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,500
But there could be an extraordinary man too.

189
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,330
What are you doing?

190
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,130
Please accept me as your disciple.

191
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,570
Silly kid, why did you have to kowtow?

192
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,550
Don’t you know this only can be used
towards the emperor and your parents?

193
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,870
You only need to bow.

194
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,980
Master for a day, father for life.

195
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,640
You deserve my kowtow.

196
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,280
What a rare guest, Grandmaster.

197
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,070
These teachers will help you with registration.

198
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,040
I’ll have to leave now,
I’ll look for you again.

199
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,620
Goodbye, Master.

200
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,640
Kid, you call him “Master”?

201
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,260
He’s not a teacher from our school.

202
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,700
But he’s my Master.

203
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,150
You’ve become a Master’s disciple?

204
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,690
Is there anything wrong, Teacher?

205
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,340
Nothing.

206
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,740
I didn’t expect he’ll take a disciple.

207
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,440
Tang San, right?

208
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,390
As a school teacher,
I need to remind you that...

209
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,120
you can’t simply take a man as your master.

210
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,630
Oh, you’re born with full soul power.

211
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,200
What? Born with full soul power?

212
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,710
Too bad your Martial Soul is
just Blue Silver Plant.

213
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,950
Blue Silver Plant, I see.

214
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,600
Every soul master can only choose
one master for his lifetime,

215
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
or else people will look down on you.

216
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,650
Do you really think he suits you?

217
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,030
What’s the matter?

218
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,760
Maybe he’s a little strange,

219
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,290
but come to think of it,

220
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,470
he’s invincible in Martial Soul’s knowledge.

221
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,960
Since you only have Blue Silver Plant,

222
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,460
it’s fine to take anyone as your master.

223
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,930
Alright, that’s it.

224
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,930
This is complimentary by the school.

225
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,770
You’ll be staying in
the seventh floor of the dorm.

226
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,630
There’ll be a teacher over there
to take care of your work as an apprentice.

227
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,020
Thank you.

228
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,110
That Grandmaster is invincible,

229
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,180
but that’s just theoretically.

230
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,190
His theories have to work right with practices.

231
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,180
Director, I heard of his
10 Core Competing Power of Martial Soul.

232
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,780
Indeed, I find it very funny.

233
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,780
Enough.

234
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,820
He’s a friend of our Dean, stop criticizing.

235
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,250
Even though no one can prove him right,

236
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,550
but that doesn’t mean he’s wrong.

237
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,520
He has great reputation
in the world of Martial Soul.

238
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,070
No, Director.

239
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,400
He’s only a famous clown,

240
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,750
people are just taking him as a joke.

241
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,540
<i>He knew that I have Twin Martial Souls
by just looking at my letter.</i>

242
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,530
<i>How is he a joker?</i>

243
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,840
<i>Let’s see who’s laughing till the end.</i>

244
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,850
Who are you? Why did you attack me?

245
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,180
I’m Wang Sheng, the boss of this Dorm Seven.

246
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,800
Thank you for showing mercy.

247
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Since you’ve defeated me,

248
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,550
you’re the boss of Dorm Seven from now on.

249
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,620
Boss!

250
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,890
Me? I’m here to study, not to be your boss.

251
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,080
This is our rule,

252
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,740
whoever wins the battle leads.

253
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,780
Yes, that’s the rule.

254
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,510
Oh, right. Did you use your soul skill just now?

255
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,200
Soul skill?

256
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Is this Dorm Seven?

257
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,640
[Next Episode]
Hello, I’m Xiao Wu.

258
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,800
Boss, it seems fun.

259
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,820
Born with full soul power?

260
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,260
It’s so huge!
