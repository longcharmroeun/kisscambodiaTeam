Chi Huo School and Shen Feng School

combine to become New Shen Feng.

Did they win?

26
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,690
For Mu Bai and me,

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,620
this isn’t just a battle of soul skills.

28
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,650
but

29
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,660
a life-and-death duel.

30
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,780
Mu Bai, I’ve never expected
you can reach the finals.

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,740
Dai Wei Si, stop being pretentious.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,340
When have you ever stopping striking me?

33
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,560

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,140
What’s going on?

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,830
Dai Mu Bai and Dai Wei Si,

37
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,200
Zhu Zhu Qing and Zhu Zhu Yun
have the same Martial Souls?

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,890
- Could they be brothers?
- Sisters?

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,520
Xing Luo Imperial School surely wins!

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,040
This girl was only at Level 20
when she left home.

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,860
In just two years,
she has broken through Level 40.

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,110
Tang San has a Decade Millennium Soul Ring.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,880
Decade Millennium?
Isn’t that leapfrog absorbing?

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,910
Aren’t we all excited to see
the splendid competition?

45
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,190
I hereby announce,

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,550
the battle between Shrek School
and Xing Luo Imperial School

47
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,810
begins now.

48
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,360
Rong Rong, Little Ao.

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,870
Jiubao Boosts! Third, Soul!

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,350
Fourth soul skill, Stimulating Sausage.

51
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,640
Fight Tang San.

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,720
Second soul skill, Nether Claws.

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,050
Third soul skill, Tempestuous Waters.

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,280
Third soul skill, Nether Slash.

Jiubao Boosts! Second, Speed!

56
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,060
With the help of
Qibao Amber Tribe chief’s daughter,

57
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,140
Shrek School is even stronger.

58
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,120
Why don’t we compete first?

59
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,400
Fourth soul skill,
Ghost Shadow Doppelganger.

60
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,420
Then I shall get rid of you first.

61
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,440
Mu Bai, it’s been a long time.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,480
Today, I’ll teach you a lesson.

63
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,350
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

64
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,660
White Tiger Shield.

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,670
Are you trying to tickle me
with such strength?

66
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,020
Glare Cutting Line.

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,240
<i>This is a self-created soul skill.</i>

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,730
After so many years,

69
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,240
your soul skill remains at the original state.

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,320
What trash.

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,110
White Tiger Meteor Strike.

72
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,480
<i>Did he swallow all the meteors?</i>

73
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,480
Break.

74
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,860
What? The meteors are still around.

75
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,250
Reverse Meteor.

76
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,300
<i>He can aggregate</i>

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,360
<i>the released soul power in such a short time.</i>

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,910
<i>I’ve underestimated this rascal.</i>

79
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,640
Reverse Meteor Shower.

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,700
Aggregate.

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,570
<i>Self-created soul skill?</i>

82
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,760
Comet Burst.

83
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,640
Such a beautiful strike.

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,530
We haven’t seen Boss Dai use this style before.

85
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,220
Not bad. I’ve underestimated you.

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,670
Third soul skill, White Tiger Earthquake.

87
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,980
<i>The floor has become like waves. I can’t leverage.</i>

88
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,370
This is your strongest strength, right?

89
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,880
Not bad. You managed to hurt me.

90
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,900
You’re like a clown now,

91
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,810
shaking in front of me ridiculously.

92
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,130
I shall end your show now.

93
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,500
Second style, White Tiger Ground Pulling.

94
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,120
Extrusion.

95
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,450
You have to be careful.

96
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,310
Third soul skill, Nether Fantasy.

97
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,350
My mind is exhausted.

98
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,350
Father.

99
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,890
Zhu Qing, Zhu Yun is so nice to you.

100
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,950
How would she have assassinated you?

101
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,840
Mother.

102
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,820
Zhu Qing, stop fooling around
with your sister. Come home.

103
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,950
Zhu Qing, you’re seven years
younger than me.

104
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,700
No matter how hard you try,
you’ll not surpass me.

105
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,100
Why do you try so hard?

106
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,290
Zhu Qing’s attacking speed slowed down.
Her expression changed too.

107
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,210
It looks like she’s in illusion.

108
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,380
Zhu Qing.

109
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,460
Doppelganger?

110
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,870
Meteor.

111
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,050
Can Boss Dai listen to me?

112
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,480
Last strike.

113
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,960
Fourth soul skill,
White Tiger Obliterate Spirit.

114
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,400
He has escaped.

115
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,100
They should buy Little San some time now.

116
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,950
I’m very vigorous. You’ll get hurt.

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,610
You’re fast. However, you’re not strong enough.

118
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,520
Xiao Wu, buy me some time.

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,260
I’ll break free soon.

120
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,590
If we work together...

121
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,130
Meteor Enhancement.

122
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,430
Boss Dai, you silly. Why did you remind him?

123
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,580
I almost forgot about you.

124
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,060
Boss Dai, use that skill right away
when you get out.

125
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,200
White Tiger Ground Pulling.

126
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,040
White Tiger Obliterate Spirit.

127
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,890
Don’t you touch her.

128
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,310
Good timing.

129
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,700
Why don’t you stay obedient in it?
Instead you’re looking for death.

130
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,300
Fourth soul skill, Invincible Golden Shield.

131
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,120
When Xiao Wu activates her Invincible Golden Shield,

132
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
all attacks at any level will be voided

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
in three seconds.

134
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,780
Besides, her power will be doubled.

135
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,260
That is Xiao Wu’s new fourth soul skill.

136
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,380
<i>What golden flare is that?
Reversed vibration? My hand.</i>

137
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,070
<i>Golden tornado?</i>

138
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,270
Combined skill, Whirlwind Supreme Drill.

139
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,860
That’s not good.

140
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,010
Unbelievable.

141
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,330
Xiao Wu at Level 40 has knocked out
Dai Wei Si at Level 49.

142
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:54,060
[Soul Land]

143
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,700
Done.

144
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,780
Dai Wei Si has underestimated his enemy.

145
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,310
No. Self-denial is an excuse of the weak.

146
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,330
- Not giving up...
- Sister Zhu Zhu Qing, give up.

147
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,380
is the quality of the Shrek Devils.

148
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,900
Zhu Qing, come home.

149
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,720
Zhu Qing, why can’t you let go of the grudge?

150
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,460
Nether Slash.

151
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,430
I didn’t expect Zhu Zhu Qing to reverse the defeat.

152
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,260
What’s going on?

153
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,640
That’s weird. Since the competition started,

154
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,900
others from Shrek School
haven’t intended to attack.

155
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,460
Besides, what’s Tang San doing,
who always controls the fight?

156
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,580
Why isn’t he fighting at all?

157
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,750
The assassin was indeed you.

158
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,950
Sister, which occasion are you talking about?

159
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,460
Strategy adjustment.
We’ve underestimated them.

160
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,540
Alright.

161
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,060
They’ve changed their strategy.

162
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,420
Tang San is taking action.

163
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,150
Seven Devils Riot.

164
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,060
Alright.

165
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,700
Fourth soul skill, Blue Silver Spike Formation.

166
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,640
<i>What is that?</i>

167
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,020
In tomorrow’s competition,
the opponent will take you lightly.

168
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,170
Therefore,

169
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,540
they’ll not show their true power
at the beginning.

170
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,590
You should make use of this point,

171
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,780
to go all out at the beginning.

172
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,600
Okay.

173
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,890
We can’t make it in time.

174
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,060
Captain, I’ll send you out.

175
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,500
Third soul skill, Magical Mirror Escape.

176
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,980
Oh, no. Dai Wei Si disappeared.

177
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,980
Disappeared?

178
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,750
This must be a passage.

179
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,460
The mirror can distort space,

180
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,550
to create an alien space.

181
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,900
<i>Dai Wei Si isn’t found.</i>

182
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,400
<i>We were careless.</i>

183
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,100
<i>How can Blue Silver Plant be so strong?</i>

184
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,730
Fatty, original plan.

185
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,480
Okay. Third soul skill, Flying Phoenix.

186
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,640
Second soul skill, Firing Bathing Phoenix.

187
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,080
What’s going on?

188
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Why did they lose their mobilization together?

189
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,980
Could it be Tang San’s new skill?

190
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,420
Except for Dai Wei Si who disappeared,
the others are like...

191
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,990
Little San studied his mutated fourth soul skill.

192
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,020
If he influxes all his soul power
into Blue Silver Plant,

193
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,940
what effect would it have?

194
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,340
Increasing dizziness.

195
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,560
It seems the desired effect is achieved.

196
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,260
But Blue Silver Spike Formation doesn’t
hold as long as Blue Silver Cage.

197
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,580
That’s enough.

198
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,190
I’ll let you feel
even stronger dizziness.

199
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,170
Fourth soul skill, Phoenix Strike.

200
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,090
The scene is spectacular.

201
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,140
They can’t even escape at this point.

202
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,680
The strength of Xing Luo Imperial School
isn’t even released yet.

203
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,710
Jiubao Boosts! First, Strength!

204
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,660
It’s my turn.

205
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,340
Fourth soul skill,
White Tiger Meteor Strike.

206
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,220
Second stage of Phoenix Strike,
Phoenix Lava Dash.

207
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,500
Fatty, behind you.

208
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,140
Fourth soul skill,
White Tiger Obliterate Spirit.

209
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,140
Fatty.

210
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,540
The attack is interrupted.

211
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,340
Dai Wei Si chose Hong Jun,

212
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,750
in order to reduce the injury
on the other teammates.

213
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,260
Such a good captain.

214
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,480
However, if he attacked Little San first...

215
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,960
<i>It’s too fast. I can’t estimate his direction.</i>

216
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,580
Purple Demon Eye.

217
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,220
Fatty, how are you?

218
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,820
How is Fatty?

219
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,220
What’s going on? There’s no wound on Fatty.

220
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,130
This...

221
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,470
First soul skill, Intertwine.

222
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,190
Master San’s Blue Silver Plant
isn’t as fast as Dai Wei Si.

223
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,940
It seems his speed increases in the alien space.

224
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,730
First, get rid of these two supporting ones.

225
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,720
Rong Rong, watch out.

226
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,070
<i>Little Ao.</i>

227
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,100
<i>Should we just let him attack us?</i>

228
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,310
My head aches.

229
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,460
Rong Rong, don’t move.

230
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,980
I’m not injured. Just headache.

231
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,140
Little Ao saved me. But he...

232
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,820
This child.

233
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,140
<i>I see.</i>

234
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,130
<i>Dai Wei Si’s attack may look like a physical one.</i>

235
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,130
<i>Actually, it’s a psychological attack.</i>

236
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,220
Hiding an invisible psychological attack
in a visible physical attack.

237
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,190
Who will he attack next?

238
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,180
You’re the next.

239
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,280
<i>Since it’s a psychological attack,</i>

240
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,390
<i>there’s nothing to be afraid of.</i>

241
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,120
Brother.

242
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,160
[Next Episode]
I must leave.

243
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,620
Coward, I hate you.

244
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,680
The crucial time of victory and defeat
has arrived.

245
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,710
Oh, no, my soul power isn’t enough.

246
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,750
Master San.

247
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,500
Victory belongs to us.

248
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,550
It belonged and still belongs to us.

249
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,720
Yet he can keep fighting?

250
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,140
Shrek School is getting
more and more surprising.

251
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,850
Since I have made a promise,

252
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,450
even if I have to pay the price with my life...
