Bastards, how can they sell her as a pet?

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,840
I come to see

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,200
who dares to beat my son.

23
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,180
Brother, isn’t that our Malicious Attack?

24
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,620
It’s in my interest.

25
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,460
Tai Long, are you still not convinced?

26
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,600
Tai Long, if we also beat your father up,

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,740
is your grandfather coming too?

28
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,280
You troublesome woman.

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,300

My first soul skill, Boost

34
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,520
can boost my soul power up by 25%!

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,940

Second soul skill, Focus!

38
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,100
<i>Focus, it can boost his power</i>

39
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,720
<i>by 20% after his first skill.
He’s 50% stronger now.</i>

40
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,880

You used poison.

53
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,640
Poison is one of my original ability.

54
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,420
Do you still want to continue?

55
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,820
You!

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,880
<i>Father.</i>

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,640

<i>Ghostly Trace!</i>

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
Tai Long, if you don’t want your father to die,

60
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,780
you’d better stop now.

61
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,500
If not, I can’t save him.

62
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,480
He’s too strong.

63
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,100
I’ve purged the poison.

64
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,980
Your father will feel weak for some time.

65
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,240
Let him rest for three days.

66
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,460
Don’t be angry and don’t use any soul power.

67
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,900
He’ll recover after that.

68
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,080
And your father made this pit.

69
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,180
You two should handle it.

70
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,920
Brother! Wait for me!

71
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
I rarely come back. My father is not around.

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,960
Grandpa Bone,

73
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,860
do you think my father is avoiding me on purpose?

74
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,760
My little princess, don’t be angry.

75
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,980
I think he’ll be back soon.

76
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I don’t care! When he’s back,

77
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,900
I want some rewards from him.

78
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,740
Grandpa Bone, you must help me.

79
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,900
I heard that my little daughter is back.

80
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,260
Let me have a look.

81
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,200
My little lass. Why are you turning
your back to me? It’s been almost a year.

82
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I miss you so much.

83
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Miss me? Don’t lie.
You hoped that I wouldn’t come home.

84
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,140
Come, little lass. Let me hug you.

85
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,420
Grandpa Sword! I miss you!

86
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,360
Good girl. You’re finally back.

87
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,000
I miss you too. Very much.

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,039
Is that so?

89
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,319
Of course. You can ask your Grandpa Bone
if you don’t believe it.

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
But just now, he said

91
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,840
he misses me more.

92
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,080
He’s lying. I miss you more.

93
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
You’re the one lying!

94
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,520
Not happy? Come, let’s fight one by one.

95
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,120
Okay. Uncle Sword, Uncle Bone,

96
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,000
you have fought each other all the time.

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
Rong Rong just came back. Call it off.

98
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,460
Uncle Sausage is not in the dorm again.

because of the battle today.</i>

104
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,600
<i>The other ability of Eight Spider Bone.</i>

105
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,980
<i>Devour.</i>

106
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,040
<i>The Eight Spider Bone can
devour the opponent’s soul power.</i>

107
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,780
<i>And it can last for one hour.</i>

108
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,960
Brother, what’s wrong?

109
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,100
It’s nothing. It’s just some minor injuries.

110
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,040
How can that be?

111
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,180
Tai Nuo is a Soul King.

112
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,580
Brother, you just fought with a Soul King!

113
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,620
And you won!

114
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,160
Tai Long and his family
love to justify their faults.

115
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,940
Brother, you defeated his father this time.

116
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,380
Will his grandfather come for you next?

117
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,840
I wonder where Uncle Sausage is.

118
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,240
He’s never around when we need him.

119
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,700
Xiao Wu, you should go back and rest.

120
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,480
I want to meditate to recover for a while.

121
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
No, I won’t leave. I will stay with you.

122
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
What if other troublemakers turn up?

123
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,960
Brother, you can meditate. I’ll protect you.

[Soul Land]

125
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,340
I can prove who misses me the most.

126
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,240
Rong Rong, stop fooling around.

127
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,380
I finally came back,

128
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,580
but you are not at home.
My grandpas are better than you.

129
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,980
Grandpas, how about this?

130
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Both of you can send me a gift.

131
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
If I like your gift,

132
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,820
it means that you miss me the most.

133
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,080
Rong Rong, that’s enough. Come here.

134
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,900
I miss you too, you know?

135
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,040
I’ve prepared a gift for you.

136
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Gift? What did you prepare?

137
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,580
<i>- That was quick!
- That was quick!</i>

138
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,520
Rong Rong, what’s your soul level now?

139
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,240
Dad, I’m not talented.

140
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,740
I only gained ten levels
even though I’ve worked hard.

141
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,060
Only ten levels? Rong Rong,
you need to work harder.

142
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,560
Wait, what? Ten levels?

143
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah. I was at Level 27 when I left.

144
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,440
Now, I’m at Level 37.

145
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,060
Level 37? Rong Rong, don’t lie to me.

146
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,840
Dad, you don’t believe me.

147
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,200
Although I have the help of the
Silk Woven Tulip,

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,680
I did train very hard too.

149
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,280
Silk Woven Tulip?

150
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,880
Half a month ago, Brother San
gave me that mysterious flower.

151
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,180
With its help,

152
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,620
I gained six levels within one day.

153
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,020
Six levels in one day?

154
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,600
What kind of plant is that?

155
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,580
I think only Dugu Bo knows about it.

156
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,500
This can’t do. Feng Zhi,

157
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,260
we need to check Rong Rong’s body condition.

158
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,240
It’ll be bad if she sacrificed her
life force to increase her soul level.

159
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,460
Grandpa Bone, Dad, don’t worry.

160
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,600
Brother San said that flower is a sacred grass.

161
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,880
It doesn’t hurt my body.
Look at this if you don’t believe me.

162
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,840
Qibao, with the power of Amber,

163
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,800
with nine stories and colours,
Jiubao Amber Pagoda!

164
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,460
With nine stories and colours,
Jiubao Amber Pagoda!

165
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,280
Jiubao Amber Pagoda?

166
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,780
Dad, do you feel better?

167
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,460
My son, I knew why you lost.

168
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,700
Even I was defeated.

169
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,780
It’s no wonder you can’t defeat him.

170
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,380
Do you know about his background?

171
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,920
He came to the school for the first time today.

172
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,640
He was sitting next to Xiao Wu!

173
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,960
That’s why I fought with him.

174
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,100
You know that I like Xiao Wu, right?

175
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Look at you.

176
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,220
You’re just like the past me.

177
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,800
Dad, you...

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,560
No. I’m saying that you’re useless!

179
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,340
You can’t even defeat a man younger than you.

180
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,940
But Dad, you were defeated by Tang San too.

181
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,780
You scoundrel. Are you asking for a beating?

182
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,820
No! I don’t mean that.

183
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,120
I’m just saying that Tang San is too strong.

184
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,680
Does he belong to one of
the Seven Major Tribes?

185
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,200
Let’s talk when we get back.
I remembered that

186
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,320
no tribe uses the Blue Silver Plant
as their Martial Soul.

187
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,820
Let’s ask your grandfather.
Perhaps he knows something.

188
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,460
Grandpa? Dad, there’s no need for that.

189
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,740
We’ve disgraced ourselves.

190
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,320
If Grandpa knows about this,

191
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,460
he’ll surely beat us up.

192
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,020
What if he went to my school as you did?

193
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,280
What? Do you have any objections?

194
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,920
No.

195
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,560
Dad!

196
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,940
<i>Qibao Amber Pagoda
is the strongest martial soul of Support Branch,</i>

197
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,340
<i>but it has a major flaw.</i>

198
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,320
<i>It can only accommodate seven soul rings.</i>

199
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,600
<i>Although I heard about
the Jiubao Amber Pagoda before,</i>

200
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,200
<i>it is hard for me to believe that
I got to witness it today.</i>

201
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,560
Dad, Grandpa Bone, Grandpa Sword,

202
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,800
now do you believe me?

203
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,740
Rong Rong, that Brother San of yours,
who exactly is he?

204
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,360
Dad, why do you have so many questions?
Where is my gift?

205
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,560
I bought this at the auction house today.

206
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,220
Although they are not very powerful,

207
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,800
they can protect you.

208
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,140
Malicious Attack? Soundless Arrow?

209
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,200
Dad, why do you have the
hidden weapons of Brother San?

210
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Your Brother San made them?

211
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,959
<i>So, it’s him.</i>

212
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,359
Look, aren’t they the same?

213
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,619
I have some more powerful weapons.

214
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,699
By the way, I want to ask you...

215
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,040
can the direct descendants of our tribe
use these hidden weapons?

216
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,160
They are powerful if we use them well.

217
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,780
I really wanted to know...

218
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,240
What kind of a genius your Brother San is.

219
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,960
Brother San? He’s just one of
my classmates in Shrek School.

220
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,680
Classmates.

221
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,060
If he’s really outstanding,

222
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,920
he may be our grandson-in-law.

223
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,900
Uncle Sword, it’s not what you think.

224
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,280
Brother San likes someone else. And I...

225
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,760
How about we go outside?

226
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,860
I’ll show you how to use hidden weapons.

227
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,640
[Next Episode] - Who’s Tang San?
- I am Tang San.

228
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,000
You’ve revealed your identity.

229
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,710
Playboy.

230
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,320
Tomorrow, I’ll go to Shrek School with you.

231
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,720
Why is Little San fighting with him?

232
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,420
Let’s make a bet.

233
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,750
What’s the bet?

234
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,130
Tang Clan!

235
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,870
Regarding his strength, he’s stronger
than most Grand Soul Land Masters.

236
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,870
What? He’s stronger than you?

237
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,940
Teacher Zhao, go and stop them.

238
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,200
This is...
