Fatty’s Martial Soul is strange,

21
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,680
he was born with the ability of flame.

After his Martial Soul mutated,

23
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,840
it might really become a phoenix.

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,710
Oscar, have you both
finished running twenty rounds?

32
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,730
Dean, I’ve done.

33
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,500
I asked about both of you.

34
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,930
Not only you.

35
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,770
Yes, we’ve done it.

36
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,130
Good.

37
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,630
come over.

38
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,800
Since you make such a good teammate,

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,330
what about you run another twenty rounds?

40
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,200
I’ve sealed your soul power.

41
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,500
Go.

42
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,900
You have to pay for cheating,

43
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,830
no matter what the reason is.

44
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,970
Do you think so, Rong Rong?

45
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,000
Tell me...

46
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,200
if you have completed your morning task.

47
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,000
No,

48
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,530
the distance was too long.

49
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,500
I was hungry,

50
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,430
I couldn’t hang on.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,430
So, you went into the city
to eat and walk around.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,030
You just got back and found Oscar, right?

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,170
You were spying on me?

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,830
As a Dean,

55
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,070
I’m responsible for every student.

56
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,830
Oscar is forgivable to lie because
he was afraid that you might be punished.

57
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,600
And you...

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,300
disobeyed your task
leaving without permission,

59
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,100
yet you allowed your senior to cover it.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,470
If any of your mistakes
happened in the battlefield,

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,300
you would be punished by the military law,

62
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,300
which is death.

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,000
This is not a battlefield,

64
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,900
it’s just a school.

65
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,830
Right.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
but this my Shrek School.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,230
You have two options now,

68
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,270
either you pack your things and leave,

69
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,700
or prove to me that you’ll never repeat mistakes.

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,070
Frander, who do you think you are?

71
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
You’re just a Soul Saint.

72
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,830
That’s right.

73
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,800
I’m just a Soul Saint.

74
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,370
Since you look down at this place,

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,330
then please leave.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,270
Chase me out?

77
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,870
It’s not that easily.

78
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,700
Frander, I warn you not to mind my business.

79
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,170
If not, you can’t bear the consequences.

80
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,670
Mu Bai, help this lady pack her things.

81
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,070
How dare you, Frander!

82
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,400
I’m in charge in my own territory.

83
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:55,930
Mu Bai.

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,330
Yes.

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,170
Ever since young,

86
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,270
you’re the first one to treat me like this.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Even you’re the precious daughter
of the Qibao Amber Tribe,

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,570
you’re merely a Great Soul Master for me.

89
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,370
Any student here is stronger than you.

90
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,270
Nonsense,

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
I’m now at Level 25.

92
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,930
I’m the most outstanding genius
in the tribe in a hundred years.

93
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,530
The Qibao Amber Pagoda is the best in the world,

94
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,800
No one can beat us!

95
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,900
Mu Bai has already reached Soul Honor.

96
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,330
Tang San’s and Xiao Wu’s soul powers
are already at Level 29.

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,070
Talking about genius,

98
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,470
they’re all better than you.

99
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,570
Although Ma Hong Jun’s Martial Soul isn’t perfect,

100
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,370
he’s blessed with the top beast soul...

101
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,270
that only a few in this land can compete him.

102
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,570
Although Zhu Zhu Qing

103
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,130
has similar soul power as yours,

104
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,700
her staunch persistence
is far beyond your reach.

105
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,200
Zhu Zhu Qing,

106
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,330
why did you come to Shrek School?

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,100
To turn myself stronger.

108
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,470
I’m an assisting type soul master,

109
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,600
of course, I can’t compete with them.

110
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,300
I’ll be much more useful in battlefield.

111
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,600
Useful?

112
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,530
Without any willpower,

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,430
you’ll be the first one to get killed
in the battlefield.

114
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,230
You!

115
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,800
With your arrogance,

116
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,170
you seriously think

117
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,130
someone is going to cover your back?

118
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,330
You...

119
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,700
What about Oscar?

120
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,800
I’m sure I’m stronger than him!

121
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,600
Have you seen a Food Branch soul master
born with full soul power?

122
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,630
You mean...

123
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,100
That’s impossible!

124
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,970
How can a Martial Soul of Assisting Branch
have full soul power?

125
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,130
Oscar is unprecedented.

126
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,470
His achievement can be boundless.

127
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,070
One day,

128
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,930
he might be able to replace
your Qibao Amber Tribe.

129
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,170
Have you realized it?

130
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,300
Among these students,

131
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,570
You’re the weakest!

132
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,800
<i>You’re the weakest!</i>

133
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,170
<i>You’re the weakest!</i>

134
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,000
<i>The weakest.</i>

135
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,930
<i>If I can’t handle a little girl,</i>

136
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,300
<i>I’m not worth of the title Golden Iron Triangle.</i>

137
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,500
Dean,

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,330
should I go and help her to pack things?

139
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,270
Do you wish her to leave?

140
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,500
Tell Oscar not to run anymore,

141
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,500
tell him to go and comfort Ning Rong Rong.

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,570
Yes, Dean.

143
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,470
<i>He dares to scold the little princess
from Qibao Amber Tribe.</i>

144
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,700
<i>Our Dean is really something.</i>

145
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,130
In this school, my words are orders.

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,230
Those who disobey...

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,210
Depart. To the Soul Arena.

148
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,870
Dean, you’re bringing them to there
on the first day?

149
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,210
All of you are monsters.

150
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,270
so let’s train in a monstrous way.

151
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,640
Let’s go.

152
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,310
[Soul Land]

153
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,870
What’s a Soul Arena?

154
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,410
That’s a place where soul masters
engage in battles,

155
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,170
and where gamblers bet.

156
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,940
For all of you,

157
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,240
that’s the best platform to improve
your actual combat experience.

158
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,070
You mean we’re going to put on a monkey show?

159
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,070
You’re wrong.

160
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,470
even though I dislike it too,

161
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,070
but I have to admit that...

162
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,640
Soul Arena is a place to show soul masters’ value.

163
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,570
It has complete system,

164
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,070
and independent influence.

165
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,070
What’s more important is

166
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,910
it’s rather fair.

167
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,810
Fair?

168
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,040
At here,

169
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,740
even if you’re a successor from a noble family,

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,010
you’ll still face a test of life and death.

171
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,070
After registration, each participant...

172
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,110
will receive an iron soul badge.

173
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,510
One point for each winning,

174
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,010
every loss, you’ll lose a point.

175
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,340
A hundred points will advance you
to bronze battle soul.

176
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,310
Before you graduate,

177
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,740
I want all of you to at least get silver soul badge.

178
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,640
Yes, Dean.

179
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,210
Mu Bai,

180
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,140
bring them to register.

181
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,710
Yes.

182
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,840
Let’s go.

183
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,740
Which rank is silver battle soul?

184
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,810
There are eight ranks of badges.

185
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,770
From bottom to top is,

186
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,570
iron, bronze, silver, gold,
purple-gold, sapphire, ruby and diamond.

187
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,640
Silver battle soul is at third grade,
so it’s not that hard.

188
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,570
It’s not as easy as you think.

189
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,610
What?

190
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,470
I’ve been in the battle when I was in Level 29.

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,010
Now I have 29 wins, 27 loses.

192
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,140
Only two points.

193
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,270
Mu Bai, how’s this possible

194
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,270
with your capability?

195
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,210
Nothing’s impossible.

196
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,940
It’s not easy in
Suo Tuo City’s Soul Arena.

197
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,610
Fatty, tell us your results.

198
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,970
21 wins, 12 loses. Nine points.

199
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,510
Why is your score higher than Mu Bai’s?

200
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,070
The battles here are arranged
according to your level.

201
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,240
I joined when I was at Level 29,

202
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,710
I won a few rounds and rose to Level 30.

203
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Then I met opponents with Level 38 or 39...

204
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,940
and lost many rounds. That’s why my points dropped.

205
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,340
I see.

206
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,310
There are three types of battles here,

207
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,240
normal battle, death battle and gambling battle.

208
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,040
The last two might cost your life.

209
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,210
We’re now going for the normal battle
just to test your capability.

210
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,870
As for the battle mode,

211
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,170
you can choose either 1-on-1,
2-on-2 or group battle.

212
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,370
Done?

213
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,270
Yes.

214
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,770
You can only take part
in one normal battle per day,

215
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,140
but you can register for different battle modes.

216
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,610
Do you want to go for 2-on-2?

217
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,510
Alright.

218
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,040
Over there.

219
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,910
Ten gold coins for registration.

220
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
Your group name.

221
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,310
Let’s call it San Wu.

222
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,270
Hey, you spelled it wrongly!

223
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,810
It’s Wu, not Woo!

224
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,470
You may change the name,

225
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,310
ten gold coins then.

226
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,440
You!

227
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,140
Forget it. San Woo then. It’s just a name.

228
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Iron battle soul Xiao Wu,
please enter the 14th battle stage.

229
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,970
Iron battle soul Xiao Wu,
please enter the 14th battle stage.

230
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,210
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

231
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,710
Welcome to Suo Tuo City!

232
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:08,670
Nervous, exciting, fair Soul Arena!

233
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,200
The first 1-on-1 battle tonight,
War Soul Master, Xiao Wu.

234
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,560
with her beast soul, Jade Rabbit.

235
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,670
Versus war soul master, Qing Bao

236
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,970
with his beast soul, Iron Horn Bull!

237
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
[Versus]

238
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,370
Look, it’s a little girl!

239
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,670
This isn’t the place you should come. Go home!

240
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:30,910
[Next Episode]

241
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,410
Ning Rong Rong.

242
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,210
Don’t ever test my patience!

243
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,770
This is Shrek School, not your home!

244
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,970
If you make me angry, I’ll kill you!
