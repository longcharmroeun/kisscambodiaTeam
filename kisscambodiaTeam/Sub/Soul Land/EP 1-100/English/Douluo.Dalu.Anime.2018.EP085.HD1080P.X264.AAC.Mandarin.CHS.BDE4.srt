You have to pay a price for what you’ve done.

What a Level 41 Soul Sect.
He’s able to control the arena instantly.

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,110
It’s Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

33
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,630
I did mention that your fire-resistance
Blue Silver Plant is useless to me.

34
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,310
<i>Do you think you can win?</i>

36
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,270
<i>How could it be? It’s like hitting a soft barrier.</i>

37
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,990
<i>I can’t feel my force.</i>

38
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,150
<i>Ghostly Trace.</i>

39
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,870
<i>It’s Little San’s Martial Skill with
control and power deformation effect.</i>

40
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,510
<i>Explosion against control,</i>

41
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,670
<i>this is no doubt the best option.</i>

42
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,830
<i>The touch of Blue Silver Plant
can trigger the explosion.</i>

43
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,630
<i>Too bad that Little San’s Martial Skill
has power deformation effect.</i>

44

<i>Xuan Yu Hand.</i>

45
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,630
<i>Even if he reacts quickly...</i>

46
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,230
Explode!

47
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,350
<i>and explode first.</i>

48
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,910
<i>But Little San has already left the explosion scope.</i>

49
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>Besides, to explode voluntarily</i>

50
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,350
<i>needs more soul power.</i>

51
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,430
<i>It’s hard for him to
release it again in a while.</i>

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,910
<i>As soon as he follows Little San’s rhythm,</i>

53
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,350
<i>he will have no more chance to win.</i>

54
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,710
Unbelievable.

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,190
He was still under restraint just now.

56
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,470
But Tang San has turned the table at once.

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,190
Now, Huo Wu Shuang is
the one who is under restraint.

58
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,590
He did it again.

59
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,070
If Huo Wu Shuang used up his soul power just now,

60
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,510
and still in the recovering process,

61
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,190
then what is happening now?

62
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,950
How is this possible?

63
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,910
Shrek has found a way to restrict Chi Huo School.

64
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,350
<i>I need to hold it back. I can’t even touch him now.</i>

65
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,550
<i>I need to find a way to go near him
to release the explosion again.</i>

66
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,510
It’s time.

67
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,870
You’ve lost.

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,830
First round, Shrek School won!

69
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,030
Brother.

70
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,350
When you’re facing me, you’re not confident.

71
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,510
If a soul master loses confidence,

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,910
how can he win?

73
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,030
Brother, are you okay?

74
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,230
I’m fine.

75
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,270
I’ve lost,

76
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,310
and I admit my defeat.

78
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,110
Uncle, this...

<i>You’re young, but you’re acting maturely.</i>

80
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,910
Second round, let’s welcome Huo Yun
from Chi Huo School.

81
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,710
No matter what trick
you used to restrain my leader,

82
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,470
it’s useless to Keen Attack Branch.

83
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,030
Start!

84
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,310

Sixth round, Shrek School won!

91
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,510
Tang San has defeated six members
from Chi Huo School continuously.

92
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,950
This is the sixth one.

93
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,350
Is Brother San going to
defeat seven people on his own?

94
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,310
Has Chi Huo School got weaker?

95
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,910
They’re not weak,

96
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,910
but Little San is too powerful.

97
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,470
Next one is Chi Huo School’s vice captain,

98
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,310
Level 44 Soul Sect
of Controlling Branch, Huo Wu.

99
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,230
[Tang San vs. Huo Wu]
If she loses this round,

100
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,430
Shrek School will create
a record of one against seven.

101
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,270
Will she complete the record of Shrek School?

102
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,590
Five Elements Schools
are comparable in strength.

103
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,430
But this Chi Huo School is going to
lose for seven times to only one man.

104
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,150
It’s fine to lose, but this is too much.

105
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,710
A mere Blue Silver Plant Martial Soul
soul master defeats the whole team.

106
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,670
I don’t think you deserve your school’s title.

107
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,990
How can this possible?

108
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,230
This Tang San is so rude to
the Five Elements Schools.

109
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,030
You need to be worthy of his politeness too.

110
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,470
Boss Dai, do you think Little San can win this round?

111
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,790
Chi Huo School will sure do their best.
Little San must be careful.

112
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,870
<i>Although I’ve saved up
as much soul power as I can</i>

113
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,110
<i>and only used up forty percent of it,</i>

114
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,870
<i>more than half of my mental power has been used up.</i>

115
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,030
<i>Why does the whole Chi Huo School can’t defeat him?</i>

116
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,870
<i>Why do I still having doubts,</i>

117
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,630
<i>when I know he has fought for six rounds?</i>

118
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,510
<i>Because he’s a soul master of Controlling Branch?
Or his fire resistance?</i>

119
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,710
<i>No, not just these.</i>

120
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,990
<i>Her temperament</i>

121
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,510
<i>has become calm.</i>

122
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,070
<i>For my teachers’ teaching,</i>

00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,350
<i>and friends’ support,</i>

<i>this battle</i>

125
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,910
<i>is not just my grudge with Tang San.</i>

126
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,630
<i>It’s related to our school’s honor.</i>

127
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,350
<i>If I lose,</i>

128
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,790
<i>Among the Five Elements Schools,
Chi Huo School will be a disgrace forever.</i>

129
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,310
<i>Thus,</i>

130
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,790
<i>no matter what, I must win.</i>

131
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,150
Start!

132
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,910
<i>She’s ignoring the skills and defense.</i>

133
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,990
<i>As long as the skills are not
ten levels higher than hers,</i>

134
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,190
<i>all skills within the attack scope
will be temporarily dismissed.</i>

135
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,100
<i>But she needs time to release this skill.</i>

136
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,540
Third soul skill, Repelling Fire Ring.

137
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,790
<i>Her soul skill’s releasing time
is getting quicker.</i>

138
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,910
<i>The width of the arena is only one hundred meters.</i>

139
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,030
<i>But the Repelling Fire Ring
can cover sixty meters.</i>

140
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,390
<i>If I’m chased by the Repelling Fire Ring again...</i>

141
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,110
<i>After the previous battle,
she seemed to practice hard too.</i>

142
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,070
<i>Controlling Branch soul master
is extraordinary.</i>

143
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,390
<i>She has pushed me to
this extent in a blink of an eye.</i>

144
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,950
Her strategy is ingenious.

145
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,710
But Repelling Fire Ring
can only reach up to three meters.

146
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,030
It can’t reach above three meters.

147
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,990
She must have other intentions
in exhausting soul power substantially.

148
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,950
Rings Fusion.

149
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,310
Rings Fusion is not a skill,

150
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,590
it’s a rare talent.

151
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,310
To channel all of her
soul power into a skill at once.

152
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,230
Right now her soul power
outcome is at the maximum rate.

153
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,590
<i>As expected, it’s hard to
avoid her attacks in the air.</i>

154
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,110
<i>This is her intention.</i>

155
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,110
<i>But if it’s just like this...</i>

156
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,670
Third soul skill,
Constraint of Spider Web.

157
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,230
This maximum outcome
of soul power will be suppressed

158
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,470
to produce an explosion.

159
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,870
The effect will be multiplied.

160
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,030
But it is not the scariest part of Rings Fusion.

161
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,430
<i>This little girl is able to use Rings Fusion?</i>

162
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,350

164
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,910
<i>Oh, no, I’m being targeted.</i>

165
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,990

Among soul masters at the same level,

no one can ever resist
my sister’s Rings Fusion skill.

170
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,350
Huo Wu is using a rare talent skill,

171
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,670
how will Tang San react?

172
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,910
Since I can’t run away,
let’s endure this attack together.

<i>Oh, no!</i>

174

<i>Once her Rings Fusion is initiated,
unless it hits its target,</i>

175
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,030
<i>it can’t be taken back.
She must figure it out to get away from it.</i>

Chi Huo School is falling into their own trap now.

177
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,910
I can’t believe that Tang San is so despicable.

178
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,070
This is a battle.

179
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,110
Even if you can control it to only attack me,

180
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,790
But judging from our distance now,

181
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,590
you’ll be affected as well.

182
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,590
Aren’t you going to stop your skill now?

183
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,470
You’re being tricked.

184
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,310
No, Huo Wu!

185
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,510
No!

186
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,910
She’s going to kill herself
along with the opponent.

187
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,110
I know that Rings Fusion
is not enough to defeat you.

188
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,070
But I want everyone to see that

189
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,030
even if it’s you, Tang San, you can’t get away

190
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,470
from Chi Huo School.

191
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,910
Rings Fusion has used up all of your soul power.

192
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,630
You can’t take this strike.

193
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,630
You too.

194
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,030
Chi Huo School will not allow anyone
to damage its honour.

195
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,310
Face your first defeat.

196
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,070
What?

197
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,870
- Little San.
- Brother San.

198
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,710
Is he nuts?

199
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,710
Foolish, how can he protect his opponent?

200
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,750
Chi Huo School

201
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,710
is a worthy opponent.

202
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,670
The competition is over.

203
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,710
Tang San is unable to fight anymore.

204
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,110
Chi Huo School won!

205
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,830
Hurry and help Little San.

206
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,710
Still not letting me go?

207
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,470
You’ve won.

208
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,790
I’ve won.

209
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,710
I’ve really

210
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,870
won?

211
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,910
This explosion is terrific.

212
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,670
Everyone, please be quiet.
Let’s wait for the next round.

213
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,350
The doctor will enter the arena immediately

214
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,550
to treat the injured participants.

215
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,310
Sister, are you okay?

216
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,790
I’m fine.

217
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,150
Brother.

218
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,910
Silly girl, don’t cry.

219
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,990
I’m okay.

220
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,230
Let’s send Little San back first.

221
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,910
As Huo Wu has given up for this round,
Shrek School won.

222
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,630
Is my brother okay?

223
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,910
Little girl, don’t worry.

224
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,310
He’s fine now.

225
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,990
Normal people will either die
or get injured severely

226
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,430
after a strike like this.

227
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,390
But your brother’s physique is extraordinary.

228
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,510
Thus he’s okay.

229
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,510
But

230
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,670
for the upcoming qualifying rounds,

231
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,310
he’d better not join the battles.

232
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,790
Or else it will be bad if his wound bleeds again.

233
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,110
Thank you, Doctor.

234
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,310
Okay, take good care of him.

235
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,670
I’ll leave first.

236
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,670
Okay,

237
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,150
the others may go to rest first.

238
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,710
You still have competitions tomorrow.

239
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,910
Xiao Wu will stay and take care of Little San.

240
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,310
OK.

241
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,110
Actually, Little San did the right thing.

242
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,550
Grandmaster, how can you say that?

243
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,750
He could have avoided it.

244
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,510
Little San did this to save a life.

245
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,470
I believe

246
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,470
when he used his body to resist the strike,

247
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,150
he must have known his capability

248
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,710
to endure the strike.

249
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,430
Why are you here? Go away.

250
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,710
We’re here to visit Tang San
and to express our gratitude.

251
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,110
We don’t need your pretended act here.

252
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,870
Tang San is still alive.

253
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,030
Dai Mu Bai,

254
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,590
don’t go too far.

255
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,110
I’m here to see Tang San.

256
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,950
I want to thank him for protecting my sister.

257
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,550
I’m not here to see you.

258
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,430
Move aside.

259
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,830
Stop being a hypocrite.

260
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,870
You really think Shrek doesn’t have anyone left?

261
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,430
Leave this place now.

262
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,670
Or else,

263
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,430
don’t blame us for being rude.

264
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,310
You...

265
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,870
I’m here to thank Tang San for saving my life.

266
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,710
My brother’s condition
is your desired results, isn’t it?

267
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,510
You’re not welcome here.

268
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,510
What is this mad lady doing?

269
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,380
You don’t need to risk your life
for a battle between schools.

270
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,270
If we meet Chi Huo School, let’s give up, okay?

271
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,550
Boss,

272
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,710
the hero saves the beauty.

273
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,390
Are you envious?

274
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,910
Please leave.

275
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,310
My brother has slept.

276
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,510
Please don’t disturb him.

277
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,550
Sorry for disturbing.

278
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,710
I’ll come and thank him when he’s better.

279
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,750
No need.

280
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,030
We’re opponents for Continental Soul
Master School Elite Tournament.

281
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,750
Opponents?

282
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,410
[Next Episode]

283
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,830
I want to talk to you in private.

284
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,390
Can’t you say it here?

285
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,870
Shrek School isn’t that good after all.

286
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,510
This is your first time on the arena.

287
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,070
Fatty, come on.

288
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,550
He’s never been on the arena.

289
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,990
Is he from some clan that uses relation
to get him in for experience?

290
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,990
Little Fatty, my vines are very fast.

291
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,830
You’d better go down. What if I hurt you?
