[Previous Episode]

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
Looks like

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,530
he acquired a great skill
for his fourth soul ring.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,320
God, why are you punishing me like this?

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,270
Xiao Gang, you are here,

28
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,700
but I still feel distant from you.

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,770
How dare you interrupt me!

30
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,690
I’ll make you regret your actions!

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,770
This is not miasma. They’re Pink Lady!

32
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,060
What? More than a thousand?

33
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,490
I’m sure a Pink Madam is leading the group.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,910
We’re surrounded.

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,480
[Soul Land]
[Episode 63]

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,760
What’s a Pink Lady?

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640
Pink Lady is a scorpion-like soul beast.

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,520
They stay in groups.

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,640
They rarely attack humans.

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,700
Because their bodies are
pinkish and transparent,

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,640
they’re known as Pink Lady.

42
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,300
A group of Pink Lady consists
of around 100 of them.

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,600
The strongest one leads the group.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,100
How do they attack?

45
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,920
Do they only use poison?

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,040
Yes. Although their poison is not very strong,

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,300
it’s a stimulant.

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,560
If you inhale too much of it, you will die.

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
I’m sure

50
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,060
there’s a Pink Madam in this group.

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,720
Pink Madam?

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,080
Pink Madam is a mutation of Pink Lady.

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,980
It should have lived for 3,000 years.

54
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,560
It has consumed at least 100 men.

55
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
But I don’t understand.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,320
Why are they so hostile towards us?

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,100
It seems like they’re ambushing us.

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,860
Master, do you think
the King of the Land yesterday is the reason?

59
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,280
It is a scorpion-like soul beast

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,960
as the Pink Lady.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,540
Maybe they’re connected.

62
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,980
Don’t tell me

63
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,240
the King of the Land yesterday
was the Pink Madam’s mate?

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Soul beasts communicate in their ways.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Before The King of the Land died,
it may release some scent

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
to alert the Pink Madam.

67
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,820
You tortured her husband.

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,700
Now, she wants her revenge.

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,400
Revenge? Fine, I’ll face her head-on.

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,980
I’ll let them die together.

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,980
The poison mist of 1,000 Pink Lady is no joke.

72
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,560
You mustn’t be careless.

73
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,880
Little San, you know more about poison.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,580
What’s your suggestion?

75
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,040
The safest way is to

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,740
escape this forest by using
Little Ao’s Flying Mushroom Sausage.

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,900
Okay. We’ll follow your order.

78
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Okay!

79
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,460
No! I can’t stand this!

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Let’s follow her.

81
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,860
Don’t kill them!

82
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,610
Pink Madam? Er Long, come back!

83
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,480
Little San, join her.
But don’t kill the beast.

84
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,030
Brother San, assist me!

85
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,310
Third soul skill, Flying Phoenix!

86
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,550
Go!

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,520
Constraint of Spider Web!

88
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,900
Fourth soul skill,

89
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,580
Phoenix Strike!

90
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,020
Oscar, kill it now!

91
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,560
The eyes are her weakness.
Kill her and absorb her soul ring.

92
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,890
Don’t be smug. Sit down and meditate.

93
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,320
Grandmaster, why are you asking Oscar

94
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,020
to absorb the Pink Madam’s soul ring?

95
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,710
Although it’s quite old,

96
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,460
it’s not very strong.

97
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,640
There are no strong or weak soul beasts,
if it is suitable for us.

98
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,950
After he acquires his fourth soul ring,

99
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,260
your team’s capability will be improved.

100
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,520
Master, are you saying that

101
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
after Little Ao acquires his fourth
soul ring from this beast,

102
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,299
he can produce the same poison?

103
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,129
Yes.

104
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,169
Soul masters of Food Branch
won’t produce any poison

105
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,399
even if they absorb
venomous soul beasts.

106
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,190
That’s why,

107
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,710
after Oscar absorbs the skills of Pink Madam,

108
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,270
his skill will change

109
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,630
into increasing our boost with his sausages

110
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,140
in an all-round way.

111
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,230
Just like the bloodlust effect of
the Frenzy Battle Team.

112
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,160
An all-round boost?

113
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,180
I think Oscar is in pain.

114
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,530
I think the grudges of the Pink Madam are deep.

115
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,410
Xiao Gang, what do you think
of Hong Jun’s attack just now?

116
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,080
It’s pretty good.

117
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,360
Regarding explosive strength,

118
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,490
Fatty is the strongest among Shrek Seven Devils.

119
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,020
He’s even stronger than Mu Bai.

120
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,430
Phoenix Flame is included in his strike as well.

121
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,640
It has extremely high temperature
and it can latch onto opponents.

122
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,720
We need to thank Er Long for that.

123
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,870
If she killed the soul beast directly,

124
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,860
Fatty wouldn’t get to enjoy this special perk.

125
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,200
Frander,

126
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,330
did you see Fatty’s weakness just now?

127
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,530
Weakness?

128
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:14,580
[Soul Land]

129
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,440
Weakness?

130
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,880
Are you talking about his continuous attack?

131
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,200
His explosive strength is strong,

132
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,660
but he used too much soul power for that.

133
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,850
At the same time, there’s a problem.

134
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,050
His fourth soul skill, Phoenix Strike,

135
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,110
is an adaptation of the
King of the Land’s Lava Strike.

136
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,480
There are two parts to it.

137
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,790
First, it stuns the opponent
using its air pressure.

138
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,480
Second, it unleashes its strongest strike

139
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,250
while the opponent is stunned.

140
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,140
Yeah.

141
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,400
Because of that,

142
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,560
Fatty has the same weakness
as the Land of the King,

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,320
the attack range.

144
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,680
Hong Jun’s Phoenix Strike needs to
get close to an enemy to stun them.

145
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,050
He can’t lock an opponent and stun them.

146
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,230
But his opponent wouldn’t let him
stun them that easily.

147
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,010
Although Flying Phoenix provides him
with a short flying time,

148
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,080
it boosts his fire ability and overall strength,

149
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
not his speed.

150
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
Because of that,

151
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,640
he needs a partner to land his strike
even though it’s very strong.

152
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,240
Are you saying that

153
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,250
someone needs to restrict
his opponents for him first?

154
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,240
Only then, he can deliver
his devastating Phoenix Strike?

155
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,880
Exactly.

156
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,990
As for their coordination,
we need to research that.

157
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,240
We can’t afford to let him waste his soul power.

158
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,610
These children are so talented.

159
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,550
All of them can be considered geniuses.

160
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,240
By the way,

161
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,160
when do you plan to allow Little San
to train his second Martial Soul?

162
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,930
We must at least wait until he’s at Level 80.

163
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,080
When the contest is over,

164
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,730
I’ll need to visit The Sacred Temple.

165
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,400
You want to see her? Aren’t you afraid
Er Long would get angry?

166
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,900
You need to help me by then.

167
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,770
For Little San, I need to see her.

168
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,790
Wait, you...

169
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,150
Little Ao, what’s your fourth soul skill?

170
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,970
My fourth soul skill is Stimulate.

171
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,890
Stimulating Sausage!

172
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,380
Those who consume it will get a
10% boost in all stats for five minutes.

173
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,530
10% boost only? For five minutes?

174
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,100
Your soul skill...

175
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
Boss Dai, listen carefully.

176
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,330
It’s a boost for all your stats.

177
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,140
It means that after you consume it,

178
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,390
your overall strength will be
instantly increased by 10%.

179
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,440
It’s not as easy as you think.

180
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,620
He’s right. 10% may not
sound like a great boost,

181
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,950
but you can fight with
110% of your strength right away.

182
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,460
And it has no negative effects.

183
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,430
You guys can unleash your greatest
strength in a short time.

184
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,120
During battles,

185
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,670
you’ll understand the usefulness
of his fourth soul skill.

186
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,870
But Grandmaster, this skill has two flaws.

187
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,880
First, the duration is too short.

188
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
Second, it can’t last long.

189
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,000
After I summon it,

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,230
it needs to be consumed within one minute.

191
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,000
But there are some benefits to it too.

192
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,260
I don’t need to use much soul power for this.

193
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,040
It’s almost the same as Flying Mushroom Sausage.

194
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,260
And there are no side effects.

195
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,270
Based on that point,

196
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,720
it’s much stronger than most
of the supporting skills.

197
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,250
Okay. Let’s move on.

198
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,320
Only three people are left
without their soul rings.

199
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,450
I hope you can find what you want.

200
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,560
Let’s rest here.

201
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,180
Although there are many soul beasts
in the Sunset Forest,

202
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,420
not many of them are powerful.

203
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,240
We’ve been searching for two days.

204
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,740
If this continues,

205
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,600
I’m afraid we can’t make it for the contest.

206
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,230
Dean Frander, I have an idea.

207
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,650
But it’s quite risky.

208
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,070
You should’ve told me earlier.
What’s your idea?

209
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,990
This is the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower
that I used two days ago.

210
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,040
With its natural aura,

211
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,340
it’ll attract powerful soul beasts.

212
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,400
Since that’s the case,
we’ll surely get our soul rings then!

213
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,440
But, under this circumstance,

214
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,250
powerful beasts will come
and they’ll come in huge numbers.

215
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,380
Little San, do you still remember where Du Gu Bo lived?

216
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,020
Master, are you saying that

217
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,030
we can use the poison
that the Old Freak left to protect us?

218
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,210
Yes.

219
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,780
Outside the Ice Fire Mouth Spring
that Du Gu Bo lived in the past,

220
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,980
there’s a poison trap guarding the place.

221
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,000
We just need to put the Fragrant Silk
Woven Flower near the poison trap.

222
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,240
If the beasts are too strong for us,

223
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,420
we can retreat to the poison trap.

224
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,620
Little San, what is this? It stinks!

225
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,450
This is to get rid of soul beasts
that are 2,000 years old and below.

226
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,310
Old Freak set up an extremely
poisonous trap around here.

227
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,310
Consume either one of these,

228
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,070
you’ll be protected for one day.

229
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,880
Consume another one tomorrow.

230
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
I think two days are enough for us.

231
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,410
It’s coming.

232
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,280
Dragon summons clouds, tiger summons wind.

233
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,080
I think it’s a tiger-like soul beast. Be careful.

234
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,920
I didn’t even lift a finger
and it’s defeated already.

235
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,330
Brother San, a Millennium Soul Beasts
is not that strong after all.

236
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,750
This is bad!

237
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,460
[Next Episode]
Er Long, there are kids here.

238
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,270
Don’t spill too much blood.

239
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,850
I know that!

240
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,160
If you have time to think of that,

241
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,640
you should think about yourself!

242
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Soul shock will destroy a person’s mentality.

243
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,540
It may cause that person to become an idiot.

244
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,250
Soul shock?

245
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,760
Retreat to the poison trap!

246
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,700
Third soul skill, Nether Slash!

247
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,720
This is bad!

248
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,480
That tiger picked the weakest spot to attack us.

249
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,940
What a strong defense!

250
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,960
The left one is the real one! Mu Bai! Be careful!

251
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,570
Fourth soul skill, White Tiger Meteor Strike!

252
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,800
Zhu Qing!
