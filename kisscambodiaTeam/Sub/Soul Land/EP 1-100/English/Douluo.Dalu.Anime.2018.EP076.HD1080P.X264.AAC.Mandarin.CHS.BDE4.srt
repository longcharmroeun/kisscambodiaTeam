Brother.

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,900
Yesterday, did someone attack you?

27
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,560
It’s Shi Nian from Cang Hui School.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,880
He’s dead.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
And I’ve got his soul bone.

30
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,060
Our opponent for the next round is Chi Huo School.

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,800
Welcome to the Central Arena
of the eleventh preliminary.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,900
Today, Shrek School will
fight against Chi Huo School.

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,540
This team has great teamwork.

35
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,920
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Third soul skill.

37
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
Raining Sparks.

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,680
<i>It’s a supporting soul skill that
amplifies its members’ attack.</i>

39
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,860
<i>It’s time.</i>

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,440
To win, we must first catch its leader.

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,820
Don’t you dare!

42
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>They’re luring their opponent.</i>

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,020
<i>Brother has fallen into their trap</i>

44
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,800
<i>and has to fight against the five of them.</i>

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,460
I’ve been waiting for you.

46
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,140
The previous six teams
have lost to Tang San like this.

47
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,900
I wonder if Huo Wu Shuang can avoid it.

48
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,260
Third soul skill.

49
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,300
White Tiger Vajra Transformation.

50
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,779
Wow.

51
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,019
Not this easy.

52
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,499
Third soul skill.

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,600
Repelling Fire Ring.

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,580
It’s a powerful mono-defense type
repulsing soul skill.

55
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,200
What a good support and control.

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,580
It seems like they are
two supports and one control.

57
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,680
But we can see them as
three Control Branch soul masters.

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,960
They’re controlling using
their supporting skills,

59
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,400
and assisting their teammates selectively.

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,540
This is similar to Rong Rong.

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,380
Gosh, I’m being tricked.

62
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,960
It’s a double trap.

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,100
They even considered
Little San’s Constraint of Spider Web.

64
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,620
Tang San, you’re the only one left now.

65
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,780
Huo Wu Shuang pretended that he’s tricked

66
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,660
to lure Dai Mu Bai
and the other three to attack.

67
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,500
And Repelling Fire Ring was used to strike back.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Next, they only need to fight Little San with all might.

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,900
Boss Fu.

70
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,460
I’ve gained another sponsorship.

71
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,120
Xiao Gang, do you think Little San can handle this?

72
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,960
Third soul skill, Raining Sparks.

73
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,140
It’s over, Tang San.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520

75
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
Dragon’s Rage.

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Third soul skill.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,700
Flamingo Clone.

78
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,660
Second soul skill.

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Seven Star Flame.

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
Gosh, Little San is all surrounded.

81
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,160
You’re too naive.

82
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,540
How can a soul master of Controlling Branch fight
the one of Storm Attack Branch?

83
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,920
What is he doing?

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,580
Oh, is he trying to suicide?

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,400
You’ve come just in time.

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,620
Third soul skill.

87
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,580
Seven Star Fire Bullet.

88
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,780
Ghostly Trace.

89
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,980
What happened?

90
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,800
Because I’m not just a soul master.

91
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,260
What is that step? Is that a soul skill?

92
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,360
Soul bone?

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
I don’t think so.

94
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,120
I didn’t detect any soul power from his steps.

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,820
This boy is keeping a lot of secrets.

96
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,680
Well done, Master San.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,120
<i>I just need to drag for a while
until the leader comes.</i>

98
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
First soul skill.

99
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,580
Fire Roar.

100
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,540
How is this possible?

101
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,000
Xuan Tian Strike.

102
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,720
Awesome, you’ve turned the table immediately.

103
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,800
Third soul skill,
White Tiger Vajra Transformation.

104
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Third soul skill, Repelling Fire Ring.

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,760
Unluckily, no matter how good your tactics are,

106
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,080
you can’t run away from
the repel of Repelling Fire Ring.

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,780
Repelling Fire Ring can protect them
for a while, but not forever.

108
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,660
The formation has suddenly changed.
What are they doing?

109
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,080
Fourth soul skill.

110
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,380
Third soul skill.

111
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,520
Raining Sparks.

112
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,920
Under full support of two Support Branch
soul master, this fourth soul skill

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,140
may surpass the fifth soul skill
of normal soul masters.

114
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,220
Fire Dance Dazzling Sun.

115
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,720
The fire is implicit
and not outgoing at all.

116
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,860
This Chi Huo girl has great control over her Martial Soul.

117
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Little San...

118
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,360
You’re indeed powerful.

119
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,500
But the victory is ours.

120
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,880
First soul skill.

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,940
Intertwine.

122
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,500
Brother.

123
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,520
Xiao Wu, do you think that Little San will do
something that he’s not certain of?

124
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,900
Have you found Teacher Shi Nian?

125
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,960
Two days ago, Teacher Shi said
that he would settle Shrek School.

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Is it Shrek School that did something?

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,220
If it was Shrek School,

128
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,120
then let them...

129
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,760
They’re targeting Little San the whole time.

130
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,280
They think that if they defeat Little San,
the rest will not be a problem.

131
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,900
But Fiery Dance Blazing Sun is powerful.

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,440
Little San may be...

133
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,360
Will he die in the fire?

134
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,840
<i>Controlling such a great power</i>

135
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,080
<i>is still barely manageable for me.</i>

136
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,960
<i>It’s time to reduce the strength.</i>

137
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,700
<i>If he’s dead, I can’t answer the school either...</i>

138
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,120
You’re so naive.

139
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,460
From the start, you’ve been misled by me.

140
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,120
You thought that fire element
Martial Soul would restrain my ability.

141
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,800
Your cooperation and
your Fiery Dance attack are good too.

142
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,880
Too bad.

143
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,980
My Blue Silver Plant

144
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,960
is immune to fire.

145
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,700
<i>After consuming
Fiery Soft Apricot and Octa Dark Frost,</i>

146
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,140
<i>my Blue Silver Plant is
resistant to both water and fire.</i>

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,080
Fourth soul skill.

148
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,200

[Soul Land]

150
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
To release Fiery Dance Blazing Sun,

151
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,300
you’ve used up
three of your supports’ soul power.

152
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,460
Can you still escape from this cage?

153
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,620
You’ve lost in the bet.

154
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,440
Third soul skill.

155
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,340
This rascal...

156
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,480
The game is set.

157
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,460
Chi Huo School’s soul power has been used up.

158
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,160
Darn it.

159
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,240
We admit our defeat.

160
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,140
Well done.

161
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,020
I hereby announce, the winner of this round is

162
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,940
Shrek School!

163
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,200
Shrek School.

164
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,260
We’ll meet again.

165
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,960
Next time, you won’t be this lucky.

166
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
I’ll wait for it.

167
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,100
Little San, you’re so awesome.

168
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,600
Now,

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
Shrek School has won for all eleven rounds.

170
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,700
We’re close to being the Champion Team.

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,300
I’ll take revenge for you later.

172
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,340
We can’t do this, can you?

173
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,540
Wu Shuang, you know I didn’t mean that.

174
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,680
Tang San is immune to fire,
but he may not be immune to wind.

175
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,280
Feng Xiao Tian, you want to have
a relationship with me, right?

176
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,620
Yes or no?

177
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,380
Yes, I’ve always liked you.

178
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,160
Great, if you defeat Shrek Team,

179
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,740
defeat Tang San,

180
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,000
I will agree to be with you.

181
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,660
Brother, let’s go.

182
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,320
Tang San, we’ll wait and see.

183
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,240
I, Feng Xiao Tian will beat you for sure.

184
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,240
Little San, you’ve shown too many abilities.

185
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,120
Displaying too much is not advisable.

186
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,740
Grandmaster, you’ve seen it too.

187
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,720
Our opponent is too powerful.

188
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,500
If Little San didn’t act like that, it’s hard for us to win.

189
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,340
Skip the next match.

190
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,720
Grandmaster, please let Tang San join it.

191
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,640
I understand your worries.

192
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,440
But for these children,

193
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,800
Continental Soul Master School
Elite Tournament is a rare chance.

194
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,140
Back then, I didn’t have the chance to join it.

195
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,480
I can only sit and watch at the side.

196
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,660
I still can’t forget that powerless feeling.

197
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,660
Master, please let me join it.

198
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,800
After this tournament, we’re going to graduate.

199
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Let us do something for our school,

200
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,720
and make up for Senior Qin’s regret.

201
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,220
Grandmaster, please let Little San join the battle.

202
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,340
Little San is the soul of Shrek Team.

203
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,120
We can’t proceed without him.

204
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,280
Boss Dai.

205
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,700
You’re like your father,

206
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,700
seems gentle yet tough.

207
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,900
But do remember that
you’ll break easily if you’re too tough.

208
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,920
Your father has suffered from this.

209
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,220
<i>Dad.</i>

210
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,420
If you want to join it, then do it.
After the tournament,

211
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,420
I’ll arrange you to go
for a long term private practice.

212
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,420
Okay.

213
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,800
This round, we’re against Cang Hui School.

214
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,120
Cang Hui?

215
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,760
That loser?

216
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,620
Yes, it’ll be easy to win them.

217
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,820
No matter what kind of the opponent,

218
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,680
you must not let your guards down.

219
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,280
Yes, Grandmaster.

220
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
<i>Cang Hui.</i>

221
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,720
Grandmaster, Senior Qin,
why not let me join for this round?

222
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,940
I won’t use my fourth soul skill, okay?

223
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,340
No way. Your ability is very special.

224
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,440
You must save it up during the preliminary.

225
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,400
Grandmaster, Teacher Qin.

226
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,060
For this round, I think we should
let Zhu Qing replace Jiang Zhu.

227
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,479
Oh, why do you think so, Little San?

228
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,500
Yes, Little San.

229
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,180
When we were facing Chi Huo School,

230
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,220
we didn’t send Zhu Qing.

231
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,540
Cang Hui School has only

232
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,560
lost for three rounds till now.

233
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,540
Their ranking is even higher than
Elephant Armoured School.

234
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,020
Their ability should not be looked down on.

235
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,220
And the preliminary have only three rounds left.

236
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,740
They still need at least two more victories

237
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,800
to ensure their ticket to go to the next round.

238
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,140
This round’s victory is crucial to them.

239
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,020
Plus the grudge they have with our Shrek School,

240
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,340
they will surely do their best for this round.

241
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,700
We must be extra careful.

242
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,760
This time,

243
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,720
let’s end the grudges

244
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,140
between Shrek School and Cang Hui School.

245
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,740
[Next Episode]

246
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,620
Are you from Shrek School?

247
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,560
Let’s meet them.

248
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,160
Finally, I don’t need to be in disguise.

249
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,360
Seven in One Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

250
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,580
Don’t let your guards down.

251
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
You’re indeed steady and calm.

252
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
But all tactics and skills are futile,

253
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,380
when facing absolute strength.

254
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
Shrek School,

255
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,540
goodbye.
