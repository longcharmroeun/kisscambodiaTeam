there is poison all over my snake scepter.

You’re seeking death!

Unfortunately, your poison is useless on me.

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,420
Little San is...

49
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,750
quite amazing.

Beware of the surroundings.

00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,350
Little Ao,

115
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,450
this skill is awesome.

116
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,920
How long can you fly?

117
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,120
It’s about 1 minute.

118
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,450
Only 1 minute?

119
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,280
It’s as short as your sausage.

120
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,080
It’s impossible.

121
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,280
The soul ring on Phoenix Tail
Crest Serpent is so useless.

122
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,350
I haven’t finish my words.

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,780
What?

124
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,280
Flying for one minute...

125
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,250
couldn’t even pass a slightly wide river.

126
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,050
If flying for 1 minute in
the Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent’s speed?

127
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,550
What?

128
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,550
Oh,

129
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,750
that’s not bad.

130
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,780
Little Ao,

131
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,820
are you sure?

132
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,920
I’m sure.

133
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,980
It may be even faster.

134
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,180

135
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,820

136
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,280
Great.

137
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,350

Little Ao,

139
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,020

140
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,620
how many of such Mushroom Sausages can you make?

141
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
For one time...

142
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,280
it should be less than 10.

143
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,050
Ten is already good.

144
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,580
When your soul power increases,

145
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,650
it will increase.

146
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay.

147
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,720
Go and get ready.

148

What do you mean that we can’t go back to school?

This Star Dou Forest is not for fun.

159

Since Little Ao has got his soul ring,

160
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,120

I need a soul ring too.

166
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,520
There’s no such thing as but.

167
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,180

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,820

Well.

Teacher Zhao,

175
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,480
can we stay on to search for
a suitable soul beast for me?

176
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,080
Of course, we can.

177
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,380
Little San,

178
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,150

189
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,650
It’s getting late.

190
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,020
Let’s move on.

191
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,820
Let’s depart to get a soul beast for Little San.

192
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Don’t let your guard down.

193
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,220
The danger of Star Dou Forest...

194
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,850
goes far beyond this.

195
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,350
Yes, Teacher Zhao!

196
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,980
Brother,

197
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,080
what happened?

198
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,430
Nothing.

199
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,670
<i>Is it an illusion?</i>

200
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,980
Tonight, let’s cultivate and regulate.

201
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,610
We’ll continue to help Little San
find his soul beast tomorrow.

202
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,820
Little San,

203
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,350
are you anxious?

204
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,650
It’s all about luck to find a soul beast.

205
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,720
Teacher Zhao, you can rest assured.

206
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,920
I am patient.

207
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,720
In the past, there were many
Millennium Soul Beasts...

208
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,720
even at the outer part of the Star Dou Forest.

209
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,920
Now,

210
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,950
I wonder if they have gone to
the inner part of the forest...

211
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,880
or there is any other reasons.

212
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,020
No matter what the reason is,

213
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,980
it’s caused by us human beings.

214
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,680
Although soul beasts are ferocious,

215
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,280
human are even more ferocious.

216
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
Soul master kills soul beast indiscriminately.

217
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,030
Even if there are more soul beasts,
they will decrease or even disappear.

218
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,830
Human cultivation can only last a few decades.

219
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,720
Soul beasts cultivate

220
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,080
for a century

221
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,150
up to thousand years.

222
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,080
Soul masters aren’t many.

223
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,050
But, every soul master could have to

224
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,520
hunt for at least 5 to 6 soul beasts.

225
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,840
Besides that,

226
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,710
how many people out there...

227
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,990
hunt soul beasts indiscriminately for living?

228
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,820
So,

229
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,620
maybe one day the profession of soul master...

230
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,350
would have no soul rings to use.

231
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,590
You are right.

232
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,990
But you and I can’t control that.

233
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,550
All we can do is...

234
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,580
to find soul rings for the cultivation

235
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,720
and avoid indiscriminate killing.

236
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,820
Teacher Zhao,

237
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,080
previously...

238
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,270
Prepare to fight!

239
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,970
Teacher Zhao, what happened?

240
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,420
Prepare to escape.

241
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,350
No matter what happens later,

242
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,250
just leave me alone.

243
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,450
Escape the forest with all your strength!

244
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,080
Mu Bai. Protect them.

245
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,720
Understand?

246
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,860
Yes, Teacher Zhao!

247
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,120
Little Ao, get the Mushroom Sausage ready.

248
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:09,320
Flying Mushroom Sausage.

249
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,350
Flying...

250
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,350
[Next Episode]

251
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,980
This is...

252
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,070
King of Forest, Titan King Ape.

253
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,590
How could Titan King Ape appears at
the outer part of Star Dou Forest?

254
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,050
What can I do?

255
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,580
Mu Bai.

256
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
Bring them out.

257
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,420
Hurry!

258
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,180
Little Ao,

259
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
I beg you.

260
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,380
I have to go get Xiao Wu.

261
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,190
If I don’t go now,

262
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,100
I will regret for life.
