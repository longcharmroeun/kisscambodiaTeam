The snow is so heavy that we can’t see clearly.

The stage is totally frozen.

Nonsense. The power of
drifting snow is so strong.

Tang San get defeated yet?

This is the scary part of Tang San.

Can you tell me the reason?

47
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,140
I have ice immunity. You can’t restrict me.

48
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,720
Then, why were you restricted
by me earlier?

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,540
My ice and fire immunity is
only effective in energy form.

50
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,240
The physical form and energy shock
will still hurt me.

51
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,380

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,560
No. It should be us who lost.

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,080
It was my mistake that led to this ending.

54
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,520

don’t originate from cultivation.

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,880
I underestimated the opponent
before the match.

No one would blame you.

72
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,460
It’s more important that
we could find the root of defeat.

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,080
It’s right, Brother San.

74
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,280
Because we have to hide our strength this time.

Fifth soul skill,

178
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
Frosty Gather.

179
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,420
<i>This broken flying knives only deplete my power.</i>

180
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,100
<i>I have to find a chance
to approach Ju Hua Guan.</i>

181
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,640
Third soul skill,
Jade Phosphor Enchanted Formation.

182
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,220
<i>How fast his speed is!
Wasn’t he deeply poisoned?</i>

183
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,780
<i>Maybe his poison was...</i>

184
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,160
<i>Luckily, Little Freak helped me
detoxify my poison.</i>

185
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,840
<i>My speed has been greatly improved.</i>

186
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,780
Ju Hua Guan, go to hell.

187
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,700
Jade Phosphor Serpent King Venom.

188
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,659
Clouds of Golden Pistil.

189
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,440
<i>I used the method of Little Freak</i>

190
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,020
<i>to store all the poisons into the soul bone.</i>

191
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,480
<i>Unexpectedly, Jade Phosphor
Serpent King Venom</i>

192
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,520
<i>works well with Medusa Soul Bone.</i>

193
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,260
<i>Thus, a more formidable
Serpent Venom was produced.</i>

194
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,380
Even if your Serpent Venom became stronger,

195
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,760
how could you surpass the oppression of

196
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,680
three-level soul power?

197
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,540
Moreover, I’m

198
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,380
the Grand Soul Land Master at Level 95.

199
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,740
[Next Episode]
Once a soul master reaches Level 90,

200
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,720
every level will be vastly different.

201
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160
Not to mention three levels.

202
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,480
Everyone’s cultivation has
made progress recently.

203
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,720
You’re awesome, Xiao Wu.

204
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
I’ve already reached Level 39.

205
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,720
I wonder how about Brother’s cultivation.

206
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,620
Tang San.

207
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,460
Tang San’s soul power improvement is too fast.

208
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,700
It’s not that I have no confidence in you.

209
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,740
Instead, you have no chance at all.
