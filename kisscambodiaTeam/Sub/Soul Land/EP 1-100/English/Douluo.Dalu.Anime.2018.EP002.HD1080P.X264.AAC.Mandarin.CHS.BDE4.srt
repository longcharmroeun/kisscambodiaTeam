21
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,830
Tang San,

22
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,080
that’s enough. Just give in.

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,170
Everything I have was given by the Tang Clan.

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,180
Now I’ll return everything to you.

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,600
Wait!

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
<i>Where...</i>

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>is this?</i>

28
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,690
We have three hundred families here
in Soul Saint Village.

29
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,740
Which of our grains and vegetables
ever had bad sales?

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,900
You’re right.

31
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,750
There was even a Soul Saint
from our village before.

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,580
Little San, Grandpa is here.

33
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,630
Go, come back before lunchtime.

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,370
<i>I’m six years old and going to be awakened today.</i>

[Episode 2]

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
Kids,

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,980
this is the handprint left by
the Soul Saint in our village.

40
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,820
It represents the glory of our village!

41
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,600
Greetings, honored Battle Soul Master.

42
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,080
Sorry to trouble you.

43
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,130
I don’t have much time, let’s begin now.

44
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,750
Alright, kids.

45
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,459
He’s the Battle Soul Master from Nuoding City.

46
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,260
He’ll lead you all to awaken your Martial Soul.

47
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,120
Please be cooperative during the awakening.

48
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
I hope one of you can be a soul master too.

49
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,900
Alright, that’s what you said the year before.

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,520
Do you think it’s easy to become a soul master?

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
I’ve been to six villages,

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,810
none of them has the soul power,

53
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,700
not to mention the Martial Soul.

54
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,140
That’s right.

55
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,650
Only the clans’ successors
can easily become soul masters.

56
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,320
It’s too difficult for ordinary people like us.

57
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,940
Get into a row, kids.

58
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,220
I’m Su Yun Tao, a Level 26 Great Soul Master,

59
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,480
and I’ll be your guide.

60
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,170
Now, I’m going to awaken
your Martial Soul one by one.

61
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,360
Remember, don’t be afraid
no matter what will happen.

62
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,570
You, come over.

63
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,390
Don’t be afraid.

64
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,750
Close your eyes and feel it.

65
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,660
Lone Wolf, join me!

66
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,680
Don’t move, I said don’t be afraid.

67
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,860
This is my Martial Soul, Lone Wolf.

68
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,500
If any of you become a soul master,

69
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,890
you’ll use the same ability.

70
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,280
<i>Human transformed into a wolf?</i>

71
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,850
<i>No, he owns the ability of a wolf.</i>

72
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,210
<i>It’s amazing to see how a soul master
uses its Martial Soul.</i>

73
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,930
Show me your right hand.

74
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,580
It’s a tool soul.

75
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,300
Sickle as your weapon, that’s quite unconvincing.

76
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,720
Your Martial Soul is Sickle, a tool soul.

77
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,520
Let’s see if you have the soul power.

78
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,169
If you do,

79
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,179
even one who has a tool soul
can be trained as a Battle Soul Master,

80
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,279
since Sickle is good in attack too.

81
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,650
Master, what should I do?

82
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,740
Keep your Martial Soul with your mind.

83
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,720
Summon it with the same way next time.

84
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,330
You have no soul power, you can’t be a soul master.

85
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,230
Go aside.

86
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,590
These are all just useless Martial Souls.

87
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,340
No attack, defence or assisting ability.

88
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,850
The Blue Silver Plant is considered
a standard for useless Martial Soul.

89
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,040
<i>It feels warm.</i>

90
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,880
<i>It’s strange, my Xuan Tian Strike
seems to be absorbed.</i>

91
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,630
<i>Something in my body has been unlocked.</i>

92
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,280
<i>This kid might be...</i>

93
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,480
Blue Silver Plant, another useless Martial Soul.

94
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,460
[Soul Land]

95
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,190
It seems I’ve wasted my time again
in Soul Saint Village.

96
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,620
Alright, kids. You may leave.

97
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,010
Uncle, you haven’t tested my soul power.

98
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,620
Forget it.

99
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,880
I’ve never seen anyone owns soul power
with Blue Silver Plant.

100
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,010
Let me try, Uncle.

101
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,220
This kid seems different.

102
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,470
Alright, since it won’t waste too much time.

103
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,580
<i>What?</i>

104
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,850
<i>As long as my crystal ball has any reaction,</i>

105
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,410
<i>even if it’s just a weak faint light,
which means the soul power exists.</i>

106
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,620
<i>These dazzling lights.</i>

107
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,440
<i>Could this kid be...</i>

108
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,610
<i>Yes, it must be.</i>

109
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,640
Kid, you’re born with full soul power.

110
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,340
Uncle, what’s full soul power?

111
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,320
Besides your form,
the strength of Martial Soul awakened...

112
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,050
also depends on the amount of soul power.

113
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,800
Most of you have no soul power
while your Martial Soul is awakened.

114
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,190
Just like the kids just now,

115
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,710
they’ll never be soul masters.

116
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,430
As long as soul power exists during awakening,

117
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,970
even if it’s just a faint light,

118
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,180
you can train it through meditation.

119
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,500
That’s the soul power we’re born with.

120
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,700
The soul power during awakening
decides the start of a soul master.

121
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,400
The more soul power you have, the faster you train.

122
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,350
While people who born with full soul power,

123
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,410
has the maximum soul power
during Martial Soul awakening.

124
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,380
<i>Maximum soul power?</i>

125
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,780
<i>That crystal ball absorbed
my internal martial arts.</i>

126
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,940
<i>Could the soul power in this world
refers to internal martial arts?</i>

127
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,710
Every ten levels of Martial Soul is given a title.

128
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,380
You’re called a Soul Warrior after awakening.

129
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,220
Those with the lowest soul power
will be a Level 1 Soul Warrior,

130
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,330
and the highest will be a Level 10 Soul Warrior.

131
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,960
Those with maximum soul power are at Level 10,

132
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,250
which are those born with full soul power.

133
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,810
I’ve never met someone who
born with full soul power.

134
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,890
<i>When I was awakened,</i>

135
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,250
<i>it was just a Level 2 soul power.</i>

136
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,020
It can only reach Level 10?

137
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,680
Can’t it be higher?

138
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,930
Of course not.

139
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,260
Without a soul ring,

140
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,140
no matter how hard you train,

141
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,390
you’ll never get the next title.

142
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,230
Soul ring is the light around your body just now?

143
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,660
You’re at Level 26,
so you have two soul rings.

144
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,250
Exactly.

145
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,700
Your case is special.

146
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,240
It’s so rare to see someone
born with full soul power.

147
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,920
But, it’s such a waste.

148
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,710
Even if your Martial Soul is just a farm tool,

149
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,930
it’s much better compared with
the useless Blue Silver Plant.

150
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,020
<i>Then, I can...</i>

151
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,420
<i>It seems like I need a soul ring...</i>

152
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,140
<i>to break through the second level.</i>

153
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,110
<i>However, what’s a soul ring?</i>

154
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,450
Uncle?

155
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,500
Master.

156
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,810
How is it?

157
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,690
Is there any kid in our village
who can be a soul master?

158
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,530
There’s only one,

159
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,960
born with full soul power.

160
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,210
Born with full soul power?

161
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,310
Unluckily, his Martial Soul is Blue Silver Plant.

162
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,520
Do you get it?

163
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,480
Blue Silver Plant.

164
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,290
Born with full soul power,
but has Blue Silver Plant.

165
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,430
This is so...

166
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,340
Master,

167
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,050
can’t we train with Blue Silver Plant?

168
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,380
We can, but...

169
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,050
even if his power increases, what do you think...

170
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,180
a Blue Silver Plant can evolve to?

171
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,380
It’s still a useless Martial Soul.

172
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,600
Such a waste for this full soul power.

173
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,460
Alright, I’d better get going.
I’m heading to another village.

174
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,860
Full soul power, but useless Martial Soul.

175
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,960
Grandpa Jack, what’s a soul ring?

176
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,610
How do I get one?

177
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,860
I have no idea either.

178
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,470
I think you need to hunt for soul beasts
in order to get a soul ring.

179
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,320
That’s very dangerous,

180
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,840
unless you’re a soul master.

181
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,920
Soul ring, soul beast.

182
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,420
Little San.

183
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,780
Are you the one who has full soul power
but with Blue Silver Plant?

184
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,560
I am.

185
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,070
Little San, I didn’t expect that
you’re so extraordinary.

186
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,210
Too bad, your father isn’t putting enough effort...

187
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,100
to inherit a good Martial Soul to you.

188
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,340
Or else,

189
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,070
you might be the second Soul Saint
in our village.

190
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,940
Tell me,

191
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,870
are you willing to join
soul master’s training school?

192
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,100
You can learn exactly every knowledge
about Martial Soul only from there.

193
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,070
My father has to agree first.

194
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,880
Good boy, we should get his permission.

195
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,320
Let’s go, let me send you home.

196
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,780
Tang Hao!

197
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,210
Who’s making a fuss there?

198
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,480
Old Jack, what is it?

199
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,060
It is your son’s awakening day,

200
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,400
don’t you know how important it is?

201
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,180
Other parents sent their kids over,

202
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,400
yet you just treat it like another normal day.

203
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,290
Little San, what’s your Martial Soul?

204
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,530
It’s Blue Silver Plant, Dad.

205
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,810
<i>Is he...</i>

206
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,920
Even though it’s only Blue Silver Plant,

207
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,220
but Little San was born with full soul power!

208
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,130
I’ve decided...

209
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,540
to give the only apprentice position in our village...

210
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,920
to Little San...

211
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,360
to learn at Beginner Soul Master School
in Nuoding City.

212
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,050
We’ll take care of the travel fee.

213
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,280
Blue Silver Plant.

214
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,500
No way.

215
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,770
[Next Episode]
Soul master,

216
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,590
what’s the use of it?

217
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,360
Look carefully.

218
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,770
Tang Hao!

219
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,470
Unless it’s a life-and-death matter,

220
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,150
never use the hammer.
