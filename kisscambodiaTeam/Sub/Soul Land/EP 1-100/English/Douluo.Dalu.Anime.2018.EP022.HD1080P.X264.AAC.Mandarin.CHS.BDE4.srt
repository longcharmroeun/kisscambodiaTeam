00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,390
[Previous Episode]
We’re not humans, but monsters.

21
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,320
Let me teach you how to be a human.

22
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,990
Nether Spikes.

23
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,950
Intertwine.

24
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,850
Dark Water.

25
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,120
Don’t you dare!

26
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,550
You didn’t even use your Martial Soul.

27
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,490
So arrogant.

28
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,220
Beating up people without
using Martial Soul is really enjoyable.

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,390
Star Dou Forest is

30
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,390
different from
other forests with reared soul beasts.

31
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,750
Watch out. Something is
heading to us in a high speed.

32
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,800
[Soul Land]
[Episode 22]

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,760
Watch out. Something is
heading to us in a high speed.

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,920
It seems to be a flying snake.

35
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,920
It’s flying two or three meters

36
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,990
above the ground.

37
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,790
It has a red crown on its head.

38
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,590
What does its tail look like?

39
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,620
Its tail is

40
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,520
shaped like a fan.

41
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,320
Zhu Qing,

42
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,390
how long is the snake?

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
What is the color of its wings?

44
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,320
It’s about six to eight meters long.

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,020
Wings are pale red.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,660
Six to eight meters,

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,790
red.

48
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,520
This is a Millennium Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent.

49
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,960
Probably 1,300 to 1,800 years old.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,020
Its age and type are suitable.

51
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,590
Millennium Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent is rare.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,290
We’re lucky this time,

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,190
Oscar.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,890
Really? That’s awesome!

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,690
The attack of Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent
is predictable,

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,590
it only uses its body to strangle the enemy.

57
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,740
But it is extremely fast.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,520
Especially its meat crown...

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,120
stores nutrition to help it speed up
to escape when it senses danger.

60
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,060
So it’s quite hard to hunt.

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,090
How do we do then?

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,960
Snakes are afraid of birds.

63
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,850
Fatty’s Martial Soul is Phoenix,

64
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,580
maybe it can restrain this snake.

65
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,520
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent is not good at attack.

66
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,860
We only need to

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,440
prevent it from escaping.

68
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,760
Good.

69
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,390
You know this soul beast well.

70
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,890
You’ll lead this battle.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,090
Okay, Teacher.

72
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,190
Get ready.

73
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,720
Fatty.

74
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,320
It’s here.

75
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,760
<i>That’s fast.</i>

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,890
Be careful.

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,790
Are you okay?

78
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Well done, kid.

79
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,220
Eat my...

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
sausage.

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,860
<i>After eating this, surrender.</i>

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,630
<i>I can’t hold it anymore.</i>

83
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,610
Retract.

84
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,910
Fatty, now!

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,220
Teacher Zhao.

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,160
Want to escape?

87
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,560
Not so easy.

88
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,480
Gravity Squeeze.

89
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,430
Orientated pursue.

90
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,960
<i>Fourth and fifth soul skill are used at once.</i>

91
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,490
<i>This is Teacher Zhao’s real power.</i>

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,590
<i>Teacher Zhao held back during the exam previously.</i>

93
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,120
Oscar, come here.

94
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,910
Okay.

95
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,290
Do we need to kill the soul beast?

96
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,160
Can we don’t kill it?

97
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,620
The weak is the prey of the strong.

98
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,290
This is the law of survival.

99
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,790
If this snake was stronger than us,

100
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,050
do you think it would let us go?

101
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,990
Let’s not delay anymore, do it.

102
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,590
Stab at its meat crown.

103
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,390
Then the soul ring will be yours.

104
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,920
Stop.

105
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,760
I’m Chao Tian Xiang.

106
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,860
<i>Chao Tian Xiang?</i>

107
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,950
<i>Sounds familiar.</i>

108
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,920
<i>Six soul rings.</i>

109
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,060
<i>Seems like she’s a Soul Emperor above Level 60.</i>

110
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,800
<i>Compared with Teacher Zhao’s
Soul Saint level with seven soul rings,</i>

111
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,570
<i>her ability is lower.</i>

112
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,890
<i>The soul rings are swaying,</i>

113
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,960
<i>but their body has not change.</i>

114
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,590
<i>That means their Martial Souls...</i>

115
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,320
<i>are the sticks in their hands.</i>

116
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
What’s the matter?

117
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,050
<i>Teacher Zhao’s attitude towards this old lady...</i>

118
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,810
Good day, respected Soul Saint.

119
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:38,380
You can’t give this
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent to this kid.

120
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,740
Why?

121
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,020
Because we found this snake first.

122
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,930
You found it first?

123
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,390
How can you prove that you found it first?

124
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,570
When we found it, we didn’t see you.

125
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,560
Kid,

126
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,590
don’t be impatient.

127
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,360
You can check its stomach.

128
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,920
There are three wounds made by my stick.

129
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,720
[Soul Land]

130
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,010
My granddaughter has just reached Level 30.

131
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,430
She needs this soul ring.

132
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,150
<i>It’s her.</i>

133
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,690
Is this Unrivaled Dragon Serpent,
The Serpent?

134
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,070
Do you know me?

135
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,020
You’re famous,

136
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,420
of course, I know you.

137
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,220
Unrivaled Dragon Serpent,
who is that?

138
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,420
Why...

139
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,460
Boss Dai, who is this old lady?

140
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Why is Teacher Zhao so polite to her?

141
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,520
The Dragon, Meng Shu,
The Serpent, Chao Tian Xiang.

142
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,890
A famous couple among the soul masters.

143
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,090
It is rumored that this couple is
inseparable and connected to each other.

144
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,560
Thus when their Martial Souls
combine, their power is great.

145
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,420
Probably stronger than a Grand Soul Land Master.

146
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,020
Is that so?

147
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,690
That means Little Ao’s soul ring is gone?

148
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,560
It isn’t for sure.

149
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,960
The Dragon is not here.

150
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,360
Only the Serpent herself is...

151
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,560
no match to Teacher Zhao.

152
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,520
<i>The Serpent is here,</i>

153
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,190
<i>The Dragon may be nearby too.</i>

154
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,090
<i>This old lady is very alert.</i>

155
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,690
<i>If we attack hastily and let her escape,</i>

156
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,360
<i>once The Dragon arrives,</i>

157
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,790
<i>we’ll all die here.</i>

158
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,690
<i>I can’t let this old lady delay anymore.</i>

159
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,620
I’m Zhao Wu Ji.

160
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,990
Oh, it’s the famous Acala,

161
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,760
Zhao Wu Ji.

162
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,790
No wonder.

163
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,320
I’m wondering why I met
such a young Soul Saint.

164
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,560
You’re exaggerating. It’s just a bad title.

165
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,390
You said your granddaughter
need this soul ring very much.

166
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,660
Theoretically,

167
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,190
I should give it

168
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,290
to you in courtesy,

169
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,560
but...

170
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,520
What?

171
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,690
We found this snake first.

172
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,090
If it isn’t for us to have injured it,

173
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,460
can you catch it?

174
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,160
Return it to us now.

175
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,260
If not, we won’t be easy on you.

176
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
That means,

177
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,990
you’ll not return this

178
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,390
Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent to us.

179
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,120
Your words are not appropriate.

180
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,710
The soul beasts in
Star Dou Forest don’t have any owner.

181
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,710
How can you use the term, return?

182
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,520
You may have found it first,

183
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,760
but we’re the ones who have caught it.

184
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,680
You said it’s suitable for your granddaughter.

185
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,730
But it’s suitable for my student too.

186
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,660
You mean these kids are Level 30 as well?

187
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,020
Oscar.

188
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:12,960
Yes.

189
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,790
Tell this elder what level your soul power is.

190
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,420
Senior,

191
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,920
my soul power is Level 30.

192
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,420
<i>This kid is younger than Yi Ran.</i>

193
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,690
<i>Yet his soul power is already at Level 30.</i>

194
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,990
Senior,

195
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,390
if there’s nothing else,

196
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,160
then we’ll leave first.

197
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,660
If that so,

198
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,760
we’ll deal with it by the soul master rules.

199
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,760
Soul master rules?

200
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,120
Please state it.

201
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,890
Battle with my granddaughter.

202
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,060
The loser will not get the soul ring.

203
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,590
I don’t think so.

204
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,160
What?

205
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,720
Zhao Wu Ji,

206
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,020
I’ve taken a step back.

207
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,860
What else do you want?

208
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,990
Are you bullying us because
my husband is not around?

209
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,560
Of course not.

210
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,890
But my student is
a Food Branch soul master.

211
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,560
What? Food Branch?

212
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,520
<i>He’s a Food Branch soul master?</i>

213
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,320
Kid, which clan are you from?

214
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,920
I don’t have a clan.

215
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,790
<i>He doesn’t have a clan...</i>

216
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,020
<i>and he’s so young.</i>

217
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,070
<i>If I can convince him to help Yi Ran,</i>

218
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,820
<i>that will be perfect.</i>

219
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,620
Kid,

220
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,060
you...

221
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,060
Teacher Zhao,

222
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,520
I’ll fight on behalf of Little Ao.

223
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,490
<i>If we delay this further,</i>

224
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,720
<i>what if The Dragon appears...</i>

225
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,360
I’m at Level 29,

226
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,290
it’s not a cheating.

227
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,020
Senior.

228
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,660
Is this okay?

229
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,090
Is this okay, Senior?

230
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:01,790
Okay.

231
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:07,890
Meng Yi Ran,

232
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,820
Serpent Stick Martial Soul.

233
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,890
War soul master
with two soul rings at Level 30.

234
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,460
Tang San,

235
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,760
Blue Silver Plant Martial Soul.

236
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,120
War soul master
with two soul rings at Level 29.

237
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,620
You first.

238
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,760
Blue Silver Plant?

239
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,460
A useless Martial Soul.

240
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,420
First soul skill.

241
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,720
Intertwine.

242
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,360
Poisonous Thorn Paralysis.

243
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,990
This battle ends here.

244
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,190
<i>What happened?</i>

245
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,420
<i>the poison is not working.</i>

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,590
First soul skill,

247
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,620
Serpent Blade.

248
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,520
<i>No wonder.</i>

249
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
<i>She uses poison too.</i>

250
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,320
<i>Darn.</i>

251
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,790
<i>I’ll end this fast then.</i>

252
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,070
[Next Episode]
Don’t let down your guard.

253
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,030
Star Dou Forest is very dangerous.

254
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,170
Teacher Zhao,

255
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,230
we may not go back to school yet.

256
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,130
Well...

257
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,730
Promise me that

258
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,030
you won’t laugh at me.

259
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,080
I’ll show you my third soul skill later.

260
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,540
Don’t be surprised.

261
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,600
Be careful of your surroundings.

262
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,050
Prepare to fight.
