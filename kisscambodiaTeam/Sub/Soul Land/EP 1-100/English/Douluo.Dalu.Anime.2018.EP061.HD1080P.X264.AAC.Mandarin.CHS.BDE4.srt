[Previous Episode]
Is he really Tang Hao’s son?

20
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,310
I’m sure of it.

21
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,790
Soul Land will experience a massive change soon.

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,650
For that, the Seven Major Tribes must be united.

23
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,250
Master, you knew about my background?

24
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,090
You must prove to your father that
you’re capable enough to help him

25
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,810
with your achievements.

26
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,770
I won’t disappoint you.

27
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,290
Rong Rong, can you give me your answer?

28
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,750
Little San, if you look at this from another perspective,

29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,010
perhaps your father didn’t leave you at all.

30
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,550
Why didn’t you two allow me
to use Hao Tian Hammer?

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,630
[Soul Land]
[Episode 61]

32
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,270
Is it to hide the fact
that I’m from the Hao Tian Tribe?

33
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,490
This is a simple question.

34
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,310
Because we want you to get stronger.

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,510
The biggest advantage of having
Twin Martial Soul is

36
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,710
you can master one Martial Soul at a time.

37
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,170
Although your Hao Tian Hammer
doesn’t have any soul rings,

38
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,290
your soul power is already at Level 37.

39
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,890
Think about this.

40
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,370
When your Blue Silver Plant is as strong
as a Grand Soul Land Master’s,

41
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,830
you acquire soul rings
for Hao Tian Hammer after that,

42
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,110
how powerful would that be?

43
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,050
There’s no mistake. Your father and I

44
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,850
are trying to create a supreme being with

45
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,050
Decade Millennium Soul Rings.

46
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,010
Now, I’m only worried that

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,650
your Twin Martial Soul

48
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,110
will clash when you’re
trying to master the hammer.

49
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,510
In our history,

50
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,190
you’re the third person with Twin Martial Soul.

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,250
We’re not the only smart ones.

52
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,310
The first soul master with
Twin Martial Soul led a poor life.

53
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,710
When he was acquiring the third soul rings

54
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,650
for his second Martial Soul,

55
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,910
the two Martial Souls clashed and he died.

56
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,750
The second person with
Twin Martial Soul was successful.

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,190
Master, did you ask me to train my body

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,590
because I have Twin Martial Soul?

59
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,670
Yes. When you acquire more soul rings,

60
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,310
you’ll get stronger in every aspect.

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,170
But when your body can’t stand the enhancements,

62
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,870
it’ll become a disaster.

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,790
In the future, if this method won’t work,

64
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,010
we’ll need to try a special method

65
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,370
to separate all the elements.

66
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,690
How do you do that?

67
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,590
By using attached soul bones.
When you reach a certain level,

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,950
it’s best if you have more soul bones.

69
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,970
When your body can’t stand it,

70
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,130
the extra elements will be absorbed
by your soul bones.

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,890
But if it is known by others,

72
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,650
many people will try to hunt you down
for your soul bones.

73
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,610
Even after knowing all these facts,

74
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,290
I hope you can keep a normal attitude.

75
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,850
Can you understand why I’m doing this?

76
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,410
Master, I understand.

77
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,730
You know that I like freedom.

78
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,930
Actually, I would rather be a blacksmith’s son.

79
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,490
My identity to me is meaningless.

80
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,490
I’m relieved.

81
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,930
You have six months left.

82
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,270
The Advanced Soul Master School Contest
is coming soon.

83
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,870
This is the best time for you to train.

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,310
I’ve already discussed this with Frander.

85
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,550
When the contest ends,

86
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,230
you guys can graduate from school.

87
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,050
Graduate? Master, isn’t this too fast?

88
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,390
No, not at all.

89
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,070
For a normal advanced soul master school,

90
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,010
you can graduate when you reach Level 30

91
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,890
as a top student.

92
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,570
Little San, come.

93
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,710
For you guys,

94
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,150
the training in the school is only a minor part
of your lives.

95
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,730
Facing the real world is more important.

96
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,010
That’s the true test.

97
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,330
Master, I understand now.

98
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,730
Okay, you can return now.

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,370
There are six months to go.

100
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,690
I won’t give them any special training anymore.

101
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,210
You guys can train on your own.

102
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,050
But I’ll guide you guys
through the battle strategies.

103
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,670
I hope you guys can break your limits
within six months

104
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,990
for the contest.

105
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,050
Okay.

106
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,890
But, Xiao Wu didn’t consume the
Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet.

107
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,750
I’m sure her progress will be delayed.

108
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,090
I’m worried...

109
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,410
<i>Worried about what?
Why do you stop talking?</i>

110
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,110
<i>Are you worried that I will delay the progress?</i>

111
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,690
<i>Never mind. We’ll see when the time comes.</i>

112
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,970
<i>If Xiao Wu cannot catch up with us,</i>

113
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,330
<i>for her safety,</i>

114
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,910
<i>she will not join every round of the contest.</i>

115
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,090
Xiao Wu, it’s late now. You should return.

116
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,130
Brother, we will hunt soul beasts tomorrow.

117
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,850
What beast do you want to hunt down?

118
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,450
I am not sure.

119
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,470
It all depends on our luck.

120
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,970
I hope everyone is lucky.

121
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,330
Brother, you guys reached

122
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,490
Level 40 within these six months.

123
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,250
I’m the only one below Level 40.
Are you disappointed in me?

124
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,770
I’m not, Xiao Wu.

125
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,230
We must go through the training
step-by-step. We mustn’t rush.

126
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,150
Now, our group is quite strong.

127
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,050
You don’t need to overthink.

128
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,350
I’m sure...

129
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,850
if you consume this
Lovesick Heartbroken Scarlet,

130
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,510
your soul power would
be the strongest among all of us.

131
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,250
Brother, don’t you believe in my strength?

132
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,010
I...

133
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,310
What? Are you worried that
I’m not strong enough?

134
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,890
And I’ll drag you down during the contest?

135
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,430
Let’s fight then.

136
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,630
I didn’t mean that.

137
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,910
You didn’t mean that?

138
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,490
Let’s have a fair fight then.

139
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,310
I will prove to you that I’m strong enough.

140
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,990
Fine. I won’t have mercy.

141
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,450
Brother, be careful!

142
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,570
<i>Xiao Wu has improved a lot!</i>

143
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,170
<i>She unleashed her Arched Body multiple
times even though she’s trapped!</i>

144
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,690
Brother, now you know that I’m strong, right?

145
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,550
Yeah. It’s unnecessary to worry.

146
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,790
Brother, can you comb my hair for me?

147
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,150
My hair is messy.

148
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,270
Comb your hair? But you need to sleep anyway.

149
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,910
Won’t your hair be messy when you sleep?

150
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,930
You’re so dumb!

151
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,430
I’ll just train until tomorrow morning.

152
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:18,450
[Soul Land]

153
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,950
This comb is made of quality wood.

154
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,950
My mother gave it to me.

155
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,390
She made the comb personally.

156
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,250
She made this with the best rosewood out there.

157
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,630
Although it’s not fancy,

158
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,390
it’s the last thing my mother left for me.

159
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,830
Brother, please comb my hair.

160
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,110
Xiao Wu, you’re really beautiful.

161
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,930
Mom! This comb is pretty!

162
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,930
Why is the wood purple in color?

163
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,090
Silly girl. This is made of rosewood.

164
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,090
Since you’ve made your choice,

165
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,290
I will give this comb to you.

166
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,530
In the future, if you do find someone you love,

167
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,970
ask him to comb your hair with this comb.

168
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,690
A woman’s hair,

169
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,610
it can only be combed by
the most important man in her life.

170
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,030
I pray for you. I hope

171
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,650
you can find that man one day.

172
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,370
<i>I found him.</i>

173
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,870
We’ve checked our equipment.

174
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,570
Xiao Wu, your braid is not straight.

175
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,210
This...

176
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,990
Little San, don’t tell me you...

177
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,030
It’s not what you think!

178
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,130
Yeah, it’s not what I think.

179
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,170
You don’t need to explain.
We understand.

180
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,790
Stop your nonsense.

181
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,790
What are you guys doing?

182
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,250
We’ll depart to Sunset Forest now.

183
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,810
Although the four of us are with you this time,

184
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,290
I need to say this first.

185
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,230
For your hunt today,

186
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,350
you will complete them yourself.
We won’t help you.

187
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,390
Tonight, the Seven Devils will keep watch.

188
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,310
You guys can arrange the shift.

189
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,070
Little San, although we didn’t meet any

190
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,230
large soul beasts this afternoon,

191
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,030
it doesn’t mean that we won’t meet them at night,

192
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,150
You must be cautious.

193
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,330
Master, I understand.

194
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,370
Xiao Gang?

195
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,390
Move aside!

196
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,270
I’ll sleep at the far right.

197
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,010
I’ll...

198
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,130
I’ll sleep here. Mu Bai and I
have discussed it.

199
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,630
He’ll take the first shift, and I’ll take the second.

200
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,310
Mu Bai will sleep here when we change our shift.

201
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,070
I’ll sleep here then.

202
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,110
Xiao Wu, I think you’re nervous.

203
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,970
Should we exchange our place?

204
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,050
You’re annoying. No.

205
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,190
I knew you wouldn’t change.

206
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,830
<i>I’m a girl! And I don’t care at all!
Why are you so scared?</i>

207
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,990
<i>This is our border.</i>

208
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,570
<i>I’ll have no mercy if you exceed the line.</i>

209
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,250
Grandmaster, you should rest.

210
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,470
I’ll patrol the area.

211
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,270
Okay, go. I’ll sleep later.

212
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,450
Aren’t you tired? I think you should rest.

213
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,930
We need to continue our hunt tomorrow.

214
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,410
<i>Yeah, I’m tired. I should sleep.</i>

215
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,630
<i>The smell of Xiao Wu’s hair...</i>

216
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,990
<i>So that’s the case.</i>

217
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,170
<i>It smells just like
the Fragrant Silk Woven Flower.</i>

218
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,050
<i>In the Xuan Tian Records,</i>

219
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,830
<i>if this smell appears on someone,</i>

220
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,870
<i>it is called as Silk Fragrance.</i>

221
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,090
<i>It’s good for the body</i>

222
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,430
<i>and it can even extend our longevity.</i>

223
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,950
<i>I didn’t expect Xiao Wu to have this smell.</i>

224
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,390
Emergency! Everyone, be careful!

225
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,090
[Next Episode] This soul beast
is 4,000 years old at least.

226
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,350
I’ll kill you!

227
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,450
Frander, I can’t believe this.

228
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,030
I didn’t believe you when you said
your sister has a bad temper.

229
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,070
But, I think you’re right.

230
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,070
I made these Cure Pills myself.

231
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,830
You will be safe from the miasma
if you consume them.

232
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,910
Everyone, be careful!
The mist is poisonous!

233
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,670
This is not miasma!
