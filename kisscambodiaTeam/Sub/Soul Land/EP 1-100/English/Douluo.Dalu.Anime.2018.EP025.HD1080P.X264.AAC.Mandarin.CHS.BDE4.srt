<i>and its venomous legs are penetrative.</i>

44
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
<i>The scariest thing is...</i>

45
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,420
<i>the spider web that it spits.</i>

46
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,650
<i>Its venom can kill most soul beasts.</i>

47
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,720
<i>This fellow seems to be a millennium one.</i>

48
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,890
<i>Human Faced Demon Spider is one
of the targets of your third soul ring.</i>

49
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,550
<i>But it’s also the hardest to obtain.</i>

50
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,320
<i>So don’t force yourself.</i>

51
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:10,990
<i>Weird.</i>

52
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,220
<i>The first thing this spider does to its prey</i>

53
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,320
<i>is spitting spider web.</i>

54
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>It can do it three times a day.</i>

55
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,790
<i>Yet this fellow is...</i>

56
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,320
<i>only attacking with its legs.</i>

57
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
<i>Could it has used up its quota?</i>

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,350
<i>My soul power</i>

59
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,490
<i>can’t defeat a fit Human Faced Demon Spider.</i>

60
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,120
<i>But when it’s injured,</i>

61
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,520
<i>as long as I can absorb its soul ring,</i>

62
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,790

<i>Now it is the time.</i>

67
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,920
<i>Blue Silver Plant can’t control it for too long.</i>

68
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,690
<i>I have to solve this as soon as possible.</i>

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,150
<i>Besides,</i>

70
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,950
<i>Blue Silver Plant’s paralyzing effect...</i>

71
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,120
<i>is useless against it.</i>

72
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,890
<i>It is venomous itself.</i>

73
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,300
<i>This is...</i>

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,150
<i>What a strong venom.</i>

75
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,030
<i>Blue Silver Plant is being corroded.</i>

76
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,800
<i>It can’t take any longer.</i>

77
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,390
<i>This is not good.</i>

78
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,330
<i>So fast.</i>

79
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,360
<i>Could it be...</i>

80
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,750
<i>That’s indeed its weak point.</i>

81
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,350
<i>Goodbye.</i>

82
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,890

88
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,920

89
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,990
How can you be so rude to Chief?

90
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,090
Please,

91
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,550
forgive me, Chief. I...

92
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,290
Second Brother.

93
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,520
Could you have forgotten...

94
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,790
that I’ve said,

95
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,590
if he came back alive,

96
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,120
he would be my sole successor?

97
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,150
Let alone...

98
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,520
Tang San is badly injured,

99
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,850
he was finally saved.

100
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,320
Should he be exhausted by your red tapes?

101
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,720
Well.

102
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
You’re right.

103
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,850
Chief,

104
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,760
I...

105
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,890
Devil May Cry was dangerous.

106
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,650
You were fortunate.

107
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,090
In addition to your Xuan Tian Strike,

108
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,950
you’re able to survive.

109
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,220
God blesses the Tang Clan.

110
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,620
How was it?

111
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,790
Are you feeling bad?

112
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,790
I feel like

113
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,250
there’s something...

114
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,550
important that I need to do.

115
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,920
However,

116
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,220
I can’t recall it.

117
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,950
Don’t think about it then.

118
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,190
You should rest in Tang Clan.

119
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,990
Everything will be better.

120
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,220
I didn’t discover your talent in time,

121
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,490
that’s why you had to suffer.

122
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,720
That was really my sin.

123
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,990
I don’t dare to blame you.

124
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,350
I, Tang San,

125
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,750

127
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,790
I’ll not

128
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,820
disappoint Tang Clan.

129
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,320
Good.

130
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,050
Remember your words.

131
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,550
Have a good rest.

132
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,850
There are a lot to do.

133
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,520
Second Elder and I will leave now.

134
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,320

Hello, Senior San.

138
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,790
Don’t call me that.

139
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,290
You’re an inner disciple.

140
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,860
I...

141
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,020
Don’t regard yourself as an outsider.

142
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Since you’re saved,

143
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,320
The Elder has abolished the rule
of inner and outer disciples.

144
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,120
The ranking depends

145
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,520
on the sequence of enrollment.

146
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,690
Really?

147
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,560
But...

148
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,290
Isn’t this breaking the rules?

149
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,860
No, Senior San.

150
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,360
You really shouldn’t call me Senior San.

151
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,160
It sounds weird.

152
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,490
Why don’t you

153
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,620
call me Brother San?

154
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,890
Senior San, what’s going on?

155
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,020

156
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,060
<i>Brother.</i>

157
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,890

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520

Xiao Wu,

Master,

161

and...

162
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,020
This is not Tang Clan.

163
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,120
I want to go back.

164
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,520

165
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,060

166
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
Chief.

167
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,920
Tang San,

168
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,860
no matter how Tang Clan did you wrong,

169
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,660
I’ve decided to make up for you.

170
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,490
Can’t you forget about the resentment?

171
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,090
Yes,

172
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,790
I can’t forget it.

173
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,060
That’s why I’m seeing you,

174
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,420
seeing Tang Clan

175
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,020
and being here again.

176
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,860
What are you talking about?

177
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,820
I think the past is too important.

178
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,390
I’ve lived here for more than 20 years.

179
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,460
Everything here has imprinted in my mind.

180
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,860
It’s hard

181
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,220
to forget it.

182
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,820
But

183
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,020
I have to move on.

184
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,520
I don’t belong to this world.

185
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,560
In another place,

186
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,860
someone is waiting for me to rescue her.

187
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,360
<i>Xiao Wu,</i>

188
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,020
<i>I’m coming.</i>

189
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,790
<i>Turns out it has neurotic venom...</i>

190
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,860
<i>which causes syncope.</i>

191
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,260
<i>Activate...</i>

192
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
<i>the inner power of Xuan Tian Strike.</i>

193
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,290
<i>Indeed.</i>

194
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,660
<i>The spider values its abdominal eyes.</i>

195
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,390
<i>However,</i>

196
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,890
<i>with the spider’s alertness,</i>

197
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,590
<i>the hidden weapon can hardly injure it.</i>

198
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,890
<i>I’ll stake all I have.</i>

199
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,190
<i>Although I don’t have the soul ring
of Iron’s Brothers,</i>

200
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,610
<i>I have the skill of hidden weapon.</i>

201
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,430
<i>Perhaps...</i>

202
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,550
<i>Second soul skill has no complimentary skill,</i>

203
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,020
<i>but its weight increases with Martial Soul.</i>

204
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,890
<i>There’s only one opportunity.</i>

205
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,890
<i>Now.</i>

206
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,090
<i>You’re finally dead.</i>

207
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,590
<i>Although my strength is weak,</i>

208
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,390
<i>when I pour in all my soul power,</i>

209
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,590
<i>this little hammer</i>

210
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,690
<i>can weight tonnes.</i>

211
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,360
<i>It’s enough to elevate you
to expose your vulnerability.</i>

212
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,720
<i>And then I killed you with hidden weapons.</i>

213
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,090
<i>Absorbing its soul ring is dangerous.</i>

214
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,620
<i>I have to squeeze out the venom quickly.</i>

215
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,890
No.

216
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,590
My Demon Spider.

217
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,190
Who did this?

218
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,190
Who did this?

219
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,690
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

220
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,690
I killed it.

221
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,090
You?

222
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,020
You again.

223
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,110
You’re Tang San?

224
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,020
Do you know...

225
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Human Faced Demon Spider is
rarer than Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent?

226
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,890
In order to hunt this Demon Spider,

227
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,220
we have been chasing it for a whole day.

228
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,720
If it weren’t for the annoying spider web,

229
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,120
the soul ring would be obtained by our Yi Ran.

230
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,490
I get what you mean.

231
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,420
But

232
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,890
I had to protect myself.

233
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,290
This Human Faced Demon Spider
appeared in front of me suddenly.

234
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,920
Should I give up my fate to it?

235
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,360
You mean,

236
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,460
you killed this Human Faced Demon Spider alone?

237
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,020
Thank you for depleting...

238
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,520
its three times web-spitting capability.

239
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,460
Grandpa,

240
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,090
please help me find justice.

241
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,520
I, Meng Shu, have been a soul master for years.

242
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,760
I’m not an unreasonable person.

243
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,020
In the face of Human Faced Demon Spider,

244
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,060
everyone would protect himself.

245
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,620
So it’s understandable that you killed it.

246
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,990
However,

247
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,320
you’ve interrupted my granddaughter
twice in getting her soul ring.

248
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,460
We can’t let it go easily.

249
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Tang San,

250
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,090
you have two choices.

251
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,590
<i>Although Godly Zhuge Crossbow
can’t injure the two of you,</i>

252
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,090
<i>Meng Yi Ran won’t be able to withstand it.</i>

253
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,520
<i>If you go too far,</i>

254
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,590
<i>then don’t blame me for using
your granddaughter as shield.</i>

255
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,890
[Next Episode]

256
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,290
Since you want to die,

257
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,460
I’ll fulfill your dream.

258
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,920
What a strong fluctuation of soul power.
