1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,080
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
DOES NOT ACCURATELY DEPICT...

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,339
ACTUAL PEOPLE, INCIDENTS,
OR A SPECIFIC PERIOD.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,509
VIOLENT SCENES MAY APPEAR,
SO VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,889
"Azazel"? What exactly is that?

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,990
Azazel is the alpha
of western evil spirits...

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,559
also known as the Devil of the Wind.

7
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,560
How did it make it to Joseon?

8
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:21,799
The answer to that...

9
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,709
will be better explained...

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,409
by your grandfather
and your father, the current King.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,610
The undead surfaced...

12
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,210
because of my father, the current king...

13
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:39,849
and my grandfather, the former king?

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,049
MOUNT SAMGAK TEMPORARY PALACE

15
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,259
TAE JONG YI BANG WON:
3RD KING OF JOSEON DYNASTY

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,280
Earplugs!

17
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,789
Put in your earplugs!

18
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,240
Surround him with bronze shields.

19
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,530
Hold up the bronze mirror!

20
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,099
Do not think that this is the end.

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,599
I...

22
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,530
am imperishable.

23
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,872
PLEASE SAVE US FROM EVIL. AMEN

24
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,719
Could...

25
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,219
the alpha spirit have come back to life?

26
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,060
A few stones moved. That cannot mean
that it came back to life.

27
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,230
Please do not be concerned, Your Majesty.

28
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,660
The alpha is clearly dead.

29
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,160
Then who moved the undead?

30
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,670
If the alpha came back to life
and was headed to Hanyang,

31
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:37,670
you would have been the first to be
attacked, not the people at Bakseok Hill.

32
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,940
But what if it went there
to attack Kang Nyung?

33
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,610
I am sure it was just a coincidence.

34
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,310
A coincidence?

35
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,850
Then what is inside Kang Nyung now?

36
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,459
Go get the guards
at the temporary palace at once.

37
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,029
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,860
Your Highness!

39
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,959
SOOKCHUNG GATE

40
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,410
Why will they not die?

41
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,569
Behead them!

42
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,979
Master Cho, what brings you here?

43
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,979
His Majesty has ordered us
to tighten security at night.

44
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
CHO HWI RYANG: CROWN PRINCE'S TEACHER

45
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,189
We have been advised not to let anyone
into the citadel at night.

46
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,390
How did you know
what to do to kill the undead?

47
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,459
His Majesty ordered us to behead them.

48
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,229
What are you waiting for?
Burn the undead at once.

49
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,800
And have more soldiers stand guard!

50
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,699
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

51
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,770
Chief Guard! Get my horse ready.

52
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,770
Yes, Your Highness!

53
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,569
Your Highness,
the curfew will commence soon.

54
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,040
Where must you go so late?

55
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,880
I think one of the undead
went into the citadel.

56
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:10,920
Well done.

57
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,240
YIM TAE MI: CHIEF MAGISTRATE
OF THE CAPITAL DISTRICT

58
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,689
Your Highness.

59
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,359
Find the lady who was in the carriage.

60
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,270
Yes, Your Highness.

61
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:51,260
Your Highness, she is not here.
Not in the guest room or the quarters.

62
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:52,859
NAEDANG: WOMEN'S QUARTERS

63
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,329
A woman, who seemed to be Minister Ha's
daughter-in-law, disappeared.

64
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,069
Search the entire area and find her.

65
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,130
Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,199
What about Eo Ri?

67
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,870
The thing is...

68
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,880
Your Highness!

69
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,250
Move all the dead bodies
to the storage room.

70
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,449
Take care of the other corpses first.

71
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:19,750
Once that is done,
you may join me in the search.

72
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,890
Make sure the word does not get out!

73
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

74
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,099
Your Majesty.

75
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,939
This man says
that he saw something strange.

76
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,209
Tell His Majesty what you saw.

77
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,479
Commoners cannot enter
the temporary palace.

78
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,290
How did a mere lumberjack like you...

79
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,719
get into this palace?

80
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,490
I was digging up kudzu roots
with Park in the woods.

81
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,300
But he suddenly lost his footing
and fell near the palace.

82
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,130
He hurt his head badly
and was on the verge of death.

83
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,939
You fool! Why are you so clumsy?

84
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,439
Park! Hey!

85
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,910
Park!

86
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:55,609
Park!

87
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,420
And for some reason, he kept trying
to get rid of the stones...

88
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,059
covering this well.

89
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,790
Then a snake crawled out of the well
and bit him on the neck.

90
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,160
But he did not seem scared,
nor did he try to run from the snake.

91
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,390
It seemed as if
he had been waiting to be bitten.

92
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,429
It was as if he was possessed
by the snake.

93
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,109
And then...

94
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,740
Park!

95
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,040
Park!

96
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,290
And soon after that,
blood started coming out from everywhere,

97
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,760
and he suddenly turned pale.

98
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,429
Then, he vomited blood and died.

99
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,370
And after that, he came back to life?

100
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,699
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness.

101
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,969
After I heard the news,
I went to take care of his dead body,

102
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,439
but he had already bitten
his children and wife...

103
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:02,640
and disappeared.

104
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,649
He disappeared after he bit them?

105
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,579
Did you find his body?

106
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,649
Not yet, Your Majesty.

107
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:12,990
Find Park's body.

108
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,589
If the alpha used Park's body
to come back to life,

109
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,159
he might have switched the host
to another merchant or soldier's body...

110
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,559
before he attacked Kang Nyung.

111
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,250
Your Highness.

112
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,730
EO RI: YANG NYUNG'S LOVER

113
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,780
Why do you have your sword out?

114
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,149
It is nothing.

115
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,649
It is cold outside.
You should come on inside.

116
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,099
Chief Guard.

117
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,440
I will look for Minister Ha's
daughter-in-law.

118
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,139
I want you to search the women's quarters.

119
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,510
Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,109
What is going on?
Why must you do this at this hour?

121
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:18,809
By any chance,

122
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,849
does this have anything to do
with the undead at Bakseok Hill?

123
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,579
How do you know about that?

124
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,419
Everyone keeps quiet
because they are scared of His Majesty.

125
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,220
But all the wives of the aristocrats
are already aware of the rumor.

126
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,460
What?

127
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,490
Apparently, rumors say...

128
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,859
the undead actually existed
during the era of the late king.

129
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,700
And some even say that the late king...

130
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,440
and His Majesty were the ones
who brought them into the country.

131
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:47,139
The throne is at risk.

132
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,879
Do not get swayed by those rumors.
Now go on inside.

133
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,909
Please be careful.

134
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,190
You should go on inside.

135
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:23,379
- There we go.
- Here.

136
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,379
- It looks great.
- Yes.

137
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,780
Goodness.

138
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,480
Do you think Lord Choong Nyung...

139
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:31,520
is still alive?

140
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,889
Why do you even bother to ask
such nonsense?

141
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,520
Just pass on the meat.

142
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,859
Those who died at Hamju Fortress
due to the plague...

143
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,960
apparently came back to life
and are walking around...

144
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,730
looking like corpses.

145
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,069
"I need blood."

146
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,099
- "I need blood."
- "I need blood."

147
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,470
That is what the rumors say.

148
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,040
- My goodness.
- Shut your mouth, you punk.

149
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,579
You keep talking nonsense
with that darn mouth of yours.

150
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,149
People refer to us
as a bunch of ignorant clowns...

151
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,809
because you keep saying absurd things.

152
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,550
How in the world can a dead person
come back to life...

153
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:08,790
and walk around...

154
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,659
wanting to suck blood?
My goodness, that is absurd.

155
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,829
That is why they call it the "undead".

156
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,159
- A living corpse.
- My goodness.

157
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,430
Quit being absurd and sleep.

158
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,200
As for you, go back
to what you were saying earlier.

159
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,470
Okay.

160
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,440
You know the magistrate's family
who was in charge of Jeongju?

161
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,010
Apparently, they have been buying
very expensive food recently,

162
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,050
and to keep their servants
from saying anything about it,

163
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,879
they have been banning anyone
from visiting them.

164
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,520
You think the head of the family...

165
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,190
is helping Wang Yu hide at his house?

166
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,819
That is the only thing that explains it.

167
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:47,190
Otherwise, why would that stingy man,

168
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,930
who never allowed anything expensive
at a village festival,

169
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,530
suddenly gather all kinds of meat
including lamb and beef...

170
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:55,899
and have them stacked up in his house?

171
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,940
It is strange.

172
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,540
As soon as the sun rises,
let us send someone...

173
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,869
to go there and check.

174
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,609
If that turns out to be true,
I will request to hold a festival,

175
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:05,680
so get ready.

176
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,550
I will quickly go and check myself.

177
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,980
But wait.

178
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,290
I heard he might be related
to the loyal subject, General Choi Yeong.

179
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,859
Do you think it will be okay?

180
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,790
"Loyal subject"?

181
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,990
Goodness.

182
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,099
Loyal subject, my foot.

183
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,099
Those darn people from Goryeo
used the words of Buddha...

184
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,430
to make us butcher cows and pigs.

185
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:31,940
They treated us butchers
like we were trash.

186
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,240
Nothing has changed even in Joseon.

187
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,339
I thought we would be free
to butcher meat as much as we wanted...

188
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,980
once it turned into a new country.

189
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,809
But they locked up all the butchers...

190
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,849
by creating a new government office
with regulations against butchering meat.

191
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,180
That is why Byeo Ri's father
got locked up.

192
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,619
That is what I mean.

193
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,730
The authorities of Joseon and Goryeo
are all the same.

194
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,159
Those darn punks.

195
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,730
Yes.

196
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,169
- Let us catch them.
- What?

197
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,369
Let us catch them all...

198
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,970
whether or not they are
loyal subjects of Goryeo or Joseon.

199
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:08,770
Goodness, look at him. Now he is talking.

200
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:10,109
Let us catch them all. Get up.

201
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,609
- Go on. Get up.
- Okay.

202
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:13,980
- Let us get them all.
- All right.

203
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,579
No, not yet.

204
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,050
- Go to sleep.
- Not now?

205
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:22,050
No. Not now.

206
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,290
Get down.

207
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,379
Where are you going?

208
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:48,780
Are you going to the bathroom?

209
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,950
I am going to visit that so-called prince
and his men.

210
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,050
What is the matter with you?

211
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,190
Why would you go there?

212
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,559
I guess that Western shaman...

213
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:02,059
reminded him of his parents.

214
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:05,300
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

215
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,129
Hey. Do not bother to go.

216
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,500
If we manage to get over the barley hump,

217
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,669
we will be able to gain so much gold.

218
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,210
So why would you go there?

219
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:16,839
Goodness.

220
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,119
Good job. Nice one.

221
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,450
Do you really think that magistrate...

222
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,220
will let us hold a festival?

223
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,059
We need to find a way...

224
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,990
to barge into his house...

225
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:38,800
to find Wang Yu
or anyone else for that matter.

226
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,899
Gold does not come so easily like that.

227
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,270
Byeo Ri is right.

228
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,440
Jeongju is on our way to Hanyang.

229
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:51,309
So if we go there with the prince,

230
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,079
they will have no choice but to let us in.

231
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,319
He may be third in line,
but he is still a prince.

232
00:24:58,619 --> 00:24:59,750
Do you not agree?

233
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,220
- You have a point.
- Yes, she does.

234
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,260
- She is right.
- Yes, I agree.

235
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,419
- You are right.
- She is right.

236
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,629
If you want to catch Wang Yu,

237
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,300
just go to sleep.

238
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,470
- Where do you want to sleep?
- I will just sleep here.

239
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,010
- Go to bed.
- I will sleep here.

240
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,909
- Let us sleep.
- Go to bed.

241
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,980
Sleep.

242
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:27,450
- Are you good?
- Yes.

243
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,250
Tell me.

244
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,220
Why do you think the late king...

245
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,520
and my father are responsible
for bringing in the undead from the West?

246
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,020
Pater!

247
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,260
Marco.

248
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,700
Pater.

249
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,569
Calm down. He will answer your question...

250
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:58,309
once he finishes
carrying out the exorcism.

251
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,950
Go on. Move his body.

252
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,690
Yes.

253
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,059
FATHER.

254
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,690
Why? What did he say?

255
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:18,500
It is already too late for them
and their throats should be slit.

256
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:22,770
What are you talking about?

257
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:26,639
Just a while ago,
you saved a man through exorcism.

258
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,450
That is because his wounds were not deep.

259
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,050
These other men
will be possessed by evil...

260
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,819
and become undead the moment they die,

261
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,250
so their throats must be slit.

262
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,889
No. They are still alive.

263
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,889
They are still breathing and can be saved,

264
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,300
so perform the exorcism right this moment.

265
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,069
It is too late.

266
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,169
But they have served
and protected me for ten years!

267
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,109
I will do what I can to save them,

268
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,540
so perform the exorcism.

269
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:09,480
Pater, it is my order
as the prince of this nation.

270
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:19,389
MARCO.

271
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,770
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON,
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT.

272
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,649
Such insolence!

273
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:46,550
Why...

274
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,260
Your Highness.

275
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,700
IN THE NAME
OF THE RESURRECTED JESUS CHRIST.

276
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:08,309
Your Highness.

277
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,619
DEFEND THOSE IN BATTLE.

278
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,250
UNCLEAN SPIRIT, DISAPPEAR!
GO BURN IN HELL!

279
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,149
SAVE US FROM EVIL.

280
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,790
I BEG YOU IN THE NAME OF GOD.
DEFEAT THOSE WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT.

281
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,240
UNCLEAN SPIRIT, DISAPPEAR!

282
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,369
GO BURN IN HELL!

283
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,819
How dare you!

284
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,889
Let go of Father John. Let go!

285
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Are you all right?

286
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,349
Pater?

287
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,659
Your Highness.

288
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,669
- Interpreter.
- Yes?

289
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,169
Why were the undead
all going after Father John?

290
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,010
They were probably following orders.

291
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,740
Orders?

292
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,050
Are you saying that...

293
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,020
a certain evil spirit possessed
my men and the gisaengs?

294
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,079
Of course.

295
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,450
There is a reason why
the alpha of evil spirits exists.

296
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,690
"The alpha of evil spirits"?

297
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,089
What kind of a being is it?

298
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:16,059
It is the alpha of all evil spirits
that command the dead...

299
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,700
as well as the living.

300
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,700
"The alpha of evil spirits"?

301
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,399
Such insolence!

302
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,339
The King ordered
this area to be off limits.

303
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:34,210
Where exactly am I?

304
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,339
Your Majesty!

305
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,550
I do not deserve your mercy!

306
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,950
Get her out of here.

307
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,079
Your Majesty!

308
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,550
Your Majesty!

309
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,240
KANG NYUNG: TAE JONG'S YOUNGEST SON

310
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,270
Father.

311
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,809
Speak.

312
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:10,540
Are you back from the dead?

313
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,510
I do not quite follow.

314
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:15,849
It is me, Kang Nyung.

315
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,950
I asked if you are back from the dead.

316
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,089
I...

317
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,319
do not follow what you are saying.

318
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,530
I am sure you remember this sword.

319
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,599
Pretending not to will not work.

320
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,369
I cannot comprehend how you managed
to escape the temporary palace,

321
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,639
but if you wish to live,

322
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,250
you will prove so
by leaving my son unharmed.

323
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,050
Understood?

324
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,559
Do not go, Father.

325
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,470
If you must,

326
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:11,140
slay me with your sword first.

327
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,109
My life...

328
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:18,010
is not all they are after.

329
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,850
They are after...

330
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,080
you, my brothers,

331
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:29,589
and Joseon.

332
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,459
Please... Execute me right here...

333
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,800
to prevent future misfortunes.

334
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,370
Please...

335
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,169
kill me today...

336
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,300
and...

337
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,910
save...

338
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,890
Do it!

339
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:05,120
Are you not curious to find out...

340
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,959
who you will have to kill next?

341
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,700
Do it!

342
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,439
Your Majesty, please end his life.

343
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:22,169
The Royal Family and our nation
depend on it!

344
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,930
I say this again.

345
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,229
Harm my boy...

346
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,640
and you will never
get to live another day.

347
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,699
What on earth?

348
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,679
You burned him.

349
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,710
That must mean he actually
came back to life last night.

350
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,980
I smell face powder from the smoke.

351
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,249
Byeo Ri, I am right. Correct?

352
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,650
That is enough, guys.

353
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,389
I was wondering where you went,

354
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
but you were here
playing with fire all night?

355
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,590
How silly of you.

356
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,740
This troupe is not one
you can come and go as you please.

357
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,909
Disobey my words again,

358
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,949
and I will have your head.

359
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,019
So leave now, if that is what you want.

360
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,999
Come on. We are sorry, okay?

361
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,199
We will be careful from now on.

362
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,010
As if you have anyone better to perform.

363
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:25,809
You darn brat!

364
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,619
I was wondering where I could find you.

365
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,980
Thank you for coming back.

366
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,329
I hope the men I sent were of service,

367
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,599
Your Highness.

368
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,429
Thank you.

369
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,170
I and those from the west
were only unscathed thanks to your men.

370
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,369
Goodness, please do not mention it.

371
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,969
It was our pleasure to help.

372
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,539
Am I right, Byeo Ri?

373
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,380
Byeo Ri.

374
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,420
Of course it was, Your Highness.

375
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:13,550
Since you are here,

376
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:16,420
could you perhaps escort us back
to Hanyang?

377
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,460
- What?
- What?

378
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,199
Your Highness.

379
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,429
All I have are you...

380
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,570
and the one whose demon was exorcised.

381
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,599
He can barely keep himself up.

382
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,269
Who will escort
the western exorcist safely?

383
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:31,110
But Your Highness...

384
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,769
Could I ask for your service?

385
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:35,610
Who are we to decline your request?

386
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,710
It is just that...

387
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,780
we are quite a large troupe...

388
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,480
who have not been able
to properly perform.

389
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,550
We are all hungry, you see.

390
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,869
Once we arrive in Hanyang,
you will be more than generously paid.

391
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,499
I would not doubt that.

392
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:03,809
We promise...

393
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,639
to safely escort Your Highness
and the western exorcist to Hanyang.

394
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,349
Byeo Ri, Hye Yum, off we go.

395
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,050
The sun is already up. Let us hurry.

396
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:19,219
Is this real?

397
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,159
Your Highness, you must not trust them.

398
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,699
All they do is hunt down opportunities
to shake people for money.

399
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,570
You never know what their angle is.

400
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,099
Those who you call lowly...

401
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,869
already saved our lives twice.

402
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,409
Yes, but Your Highness...

403
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,740
Have a pigeon ready
to deliver my letter to the King...

404
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:44,179
and collect all identity tags
of the fallen soldiers.

405
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,219
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:00,130
Your Majesty,
I am here to greet you this morning...

407
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,400
I hear that the daughter-in-law
of Minister Ha who became an undead...

408
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,030
walked past Sookchung Gate.

409
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,039
Was that not where you were stationed at?

410
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,740
Yes.

411
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,380
I was in charge of its security.

412
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,449
Even after seeing
what happened to Kang Nyung,

413
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,619
you must have been wining
with Eo Ri again.

414
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:35,499
And still you wish to be treated
as the crown prince of this nation?

415
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,170
Your Majesty,

416
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,670
he was the one who
first suspected the daughter-in-law...

417
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,570
and went after her all night.

418
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,440
He stayed up all night...

419
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,469
to search for her.

420
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,240
So, did you find her?

421
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,050
I asked if you found her.

422
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:57,650
I am ashamed, Your Majesty.

423
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,929
Hwi Ryang, Assistant Councilor
of the State Council.

424
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

425
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,300
Sookchung Gate,
being at the base of Mount Baekak,

426
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,499
increases the negative energy
within the capital.

427
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:17,740
It will, therefore,
only attract more spirits and the undead.

428
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,070
Permanently seal off the gate...

429
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,639
so that it is never open again.

430
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,150
As of this hour,
all castle gates will be closed...

431
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,579
and the search
for the daughter-in-law will commence.

432
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,550
If she is not found,

433
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,420
you will pay with your head.

434
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:34,219
Understood?

435
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

436
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,329
Your Majesty!

437
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,329
Your Majesty.

438
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,900
Lord Choong Nyung has sent
an urgent letter.

439
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:54,409
Father,

440
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,909
I witnessed the western exorcist
saving a man...

441
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,449
who was bitten by an undead
through exorcism.

442
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,880
I believe we will be able
to save our people even if...

443
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,590
another attack like in Bakseok Hill
may occur.

444
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,590
While you were in Uiju,

445
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,760
Kang Nyung was bitten by an undead
and now an evil spirit possesses him.

446
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,800
Bring back the western exorcist
as soon as possible...

447
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,599
and save your brother.

448
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,039
Your Highness,
that letter is from His Majesty.

449
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,230
Why has Father requested
the western exorcist?

450
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,760
QUEEN WON MYUNG: WIFE OF TAE JONG

451
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:47,030
I do not know.

452
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,360
Kang Nyung's life depends on this.

453
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:53,900
Mother?

454
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:56,139
Could...

455
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,010
Could the vile rumor about
Father and Grandfather being the ones...

456
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:04,650
who summoned the undead
in the first place be true?

457
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:10,820
Crown Prince...

458
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,490
So it is true.

459
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:15,420
That...

460
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,159
you will learn once you are on the throne.

461
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,300
So be patient for now
and trust your father.

462
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,559
No.

463
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,469
I am done being patient.

464
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:29,070
Father blames me in every matter...

465
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,240
and only accuses me of any wrongdoing.

466
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,510
I am done playing his game.

467
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:35,909
I will find out where this all started...

468
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,210
and who summoned the undead into Joseon.

469
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,249
As the crown prince,

470
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,719
I will hold the guilty party responsible.

471
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:47,960
No matter...

472
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,590
who it may be.

473
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,159
Crown Prince!

474
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,670
Your Majesty,

475
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,999
how will we overcome this?

476
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,010
You must be hungry. Give it out.

477
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,050
Okay.

478
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,849
You get two.

479
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:28,559
Enjoy.

480
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,969
Here you go.

481
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:47,579
Let us eat!

482
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,619
- Oh, boy.
- Time to eat!

483
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,119
Hey, you. Where are you from?

484
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,990
It is not like an ignorant lowborn
like you would know if I told you.

485
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,429
I am from Vatican City.

486
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,900
"Vatican City"?

487
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,269
Is it a good place to live?

488
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:10,869
Yes, it is nice there.

489
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,469
All the crops grow very well,
and even the grapes are huge.

490
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,809
And they eat bread instead of rice.

491
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,150
Do you know what bread is?

492
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:22,150
You grind wheat.
Then you ferment and bake it.

493
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,880
And you get huge bread.

494
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:25,550
You know what
barley rice cakes are, right?

495
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,760
Bread tastes 30,000 times better.

496
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,059
Nonsense.

497
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,990
I am sure it is the same
where nobles get to enjoy the good life...

498
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,059
when slaves and lowborns like us...

499
00:45:36,429 --> 00:45:38,230
are barely alive,
trying to eke out a living.

500
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,170
It is the same everywhere. Am I wrong?

501
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,269
You brat,
you keep dropping the honorifics.

502
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,909
You are all resentful
because your life is a mess.

503
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,579
It is different there.

504
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,320
Even slaves get to live comfortably
if they work hard.

505
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,119
And everyone has freedom.

506
00:45:56,249 --> 00:45:58,190
Come on! You are lying to my face.

507
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,159
A country like that does not exist.

508
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,289
What is wrong with you?
Is it because you look like a girl?

509
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,090
Why can you not trust anything I tell you?

510
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,999
Do you have everything down there?

511
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:11,869
Hey, Mr. Interpreter.

512
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:19,010
What will you give me
if mine is bigger than yours?

513
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,550
Shall I slit your throat
or cut off your thing down there?

514
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,249
Shall we both take our pants off and see?

515
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:30,420
You lunatic.
Get that thing out of my face.

516
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,320
Sickles scare me.

517
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,289
I said, get it out of my face!

518
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,289
Enough.

519
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,800
Hye Yum has a feisty temper!

520
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:46,730
Your Highness.

521
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:49,440
There is a town called Jeongju over there.

522
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,670
The sun will set soon.
How about we find a place to sleep?

523
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:55,510
Let us do that.

524
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,480
Your Highness, we do not have time.

525
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,679
We do not know
when we could be attacked by the undead.

526
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,249
It will be dangerous to travel at night.

527
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,249
Ji Gyeom, we should just
go to bed early tonight...

528
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,920
and leave as soon as the sun comes up.

529
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:10,860
Yes, Your Highness.

530
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,400
Hey! Eat quickly!

531
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,070
The sun will set soon!

532
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:22,300
- Hey, Let us go!
- Let us go!

533
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,969
- Goodness.
- Let us go.

534
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:51,999
Who is it?

535
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,809
What is all this fuss about?

536
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:03,909
My goodness.

537
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,650
We heard you are holding a ritual
for the household deity today.

538
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,619
If you would kindly let us stay here
for the night,

539
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,889
we will get rid of all the evil spirits
for you...

540
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,960
and make sure
you live a long healthy life...

541
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,789
by holding a ceremony filled
with exciting performances!

542
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:20,460
- Yes!
- That is right!

543
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,300
You fools.

544
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,099
Winter is long gone.
We already held the ritual a while back.

545
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,199
Stop talking nonsense and leave at once.

546
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,510
- Hang on a second.
- How dare you!

547
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,240
Do you even know whose residence this is?

548
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,679
Leave at once!

549
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:40,909
Oh, dear.

550
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,789
Well, I am happy to leave.

551
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:51,159
But you should not kick out
Lord Choong Nyung.

552
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,960
Lord Choong Nyung!

553
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,429
Hey! How am I supposed to believe you?

554
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:09,110
Who are you?

555
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:17,349
Give me a moment.

556
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:22,690
Go and let the magistrate know...

557
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,190
that royal guards are here...

558
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:26,590
with Lord Choong Nyung
disguised as traveling actors. Go!

559
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,630
Yes, sir!

560
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Well...

561
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,070
If you are okay with staying
at this humble abode, please come on in.

562
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:40,639
Come on, guys.
Let us go inside, all of you!

563
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,539
Wait, all of them?

564
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,780
Hey, wait! Hey!

565
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,710
Not all of them! Hey, where are you going?

566
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:50,280
No! My goodness.

567
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,990
Anybody there?

568
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,190
Gosh, come help me!

569
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:58,460
Goodness. Stop! Please stop!

570
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,300
You cannot barge in here like this.

571
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:06,599
Stop this, please!

572
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:10,699
Oh, no. The energy of the site
this house is built on is very strong.

573
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,210
I suppose that is why only men
can live here.

574
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,039
I do not see a single female servant!

575
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:19,210
Oh, you are right!

576
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,249
What do you say?

577
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:26,219
The magistrate is kindly letting us
stay here for the night.

578
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:29,260
How about we tame
the household deity for him?

579
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:31,559
- Sounds good!
- Sounds good!

580
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,960
Hey, you fools!

581
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,969
Why are you guys just standing there,
wide-eyed?

582
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,639
Let us have some fun. Come on!

583
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,170
Here we go!

584
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,070
Gosh, you cannot do this. Stop.

585
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,539
My goodness! This is crazy.

586
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,510
No! You cannot come in. Stop!

587
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,719
Hey! My gosh.

588
00:50:54,749 --> 00:50:57,119
Goodness, no!

589
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,519
What are you doing?

590
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,090
We cannot just barge in
without the magistrate's permission!

591
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:04,960
We need to make a living, you know.

592
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
Please turn a blind eye to this,
Your Highness.

593
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

594
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:12,929
What are you waiting for?

595
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,269
Set up the posts
so we can walk the tightrope!

596
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,309
That jerk...

597
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,940
Your Highness, what did I say?

598
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:25,409
I told you those clowns
would have another agenda.

599
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,050
How dare they...

600
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,780
use a prince to barge in here?

601
00:51:30,449 --> 00:51:32,219
- I shall...
- Ji Gyeom.

602
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:37,820
Since this already happened,
I will just let them use me for the day.

603
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:41,260
I will speak with the magistrate.

604
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,199
Just find a room for Pater
so he can get some rest.

605
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:45,699
I need to ask him something.

606
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,199
Yes, Your Highness.

607
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:56,139
It does not look like they came here
knowing that you are here.

608
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
What should we do?

609
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,849
What is that?

610
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,519
General Choi Moo Sun
of the Firearms Directorate gave me this.

611
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,019
It is a grenade filled with gunpowder.

612
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,659
Do you plan to strike them first?

613
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,059
That young man over there
is Lord Choong Nyung,

614
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,699
Yi Bang Won's favorite son.
Will this be okay?

615
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:18,670
It is actually a good thing.

616
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,199
I shall behead him
to avenge my royal families of Goryeo,

617
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,110
who were killed in Ganghwa Island.

618
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,539
This is not enough to avenge their deaths.

619
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,309
Rumor has it that
the undeads have been seen in the area.

620
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,280
The moment this grenade goes off,
they will flock here.

621
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,389
I thought it was a groundless rumor.

622
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,289
Do they actually exist?

623
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,219
Here. Do not worry about a thing
and just get ready.

624
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:47,260
I know how to handle them.

625
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,429
Understood.

626
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,809
What are you doing? Come gather around.

627
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:16,159
Wang Yu must be hiding in
the main building or the inner quarters,

628
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:18,889
so we ought to do whatever it takes...

629
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,329
to drag out every single person
inside the house.

630
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,630
While you guys do that,
Ying Choon and I will get Wang Yu.

631
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:25,800
Got it?

632
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,230
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

633
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,070
Those punks...

634
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,280
Byeo Ri! Hye Yum!

635
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,449
- Go.
- Your job is to drag out...

636
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,820
all of Wang Yu's guards.

637
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,349
What are you doing?

638
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:45,150
What is this?

639
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:47,949
Why are you fooling around here
looking like fish out of the sea?

640
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,420
Get yourself together.

641
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,300
Go all out.

642
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,170
I know that you are planning to flee
to the West after the job is done anyway.

643
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,639
We will give you enough money
so you can get there.

644
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,840
Just go catch every single one
of Wang Yu's guards.

645
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:16,980
They will do fine.

646
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,590
- Let us go.
- Come on.

647
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,079
I have heard many great things

648
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:52,849
About the great family in Jeongju

649
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:54,619
Let us go!

650
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,130
Let us go have fun there!

651
00:54:58,659 --> 00:54:59,789
Go!

652
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,360
Let us go!

653
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:04,329
Let us go, let us go

654
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,499
Let us go to the family in Jeongju
and have fun

655
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,869
Let us go!

656
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,679
Have you still not found the man
who opened the gates?

657
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,380
No, Your Highness.

658
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,019
Your Highness.

659
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:25,920
I do not want anyone following me.

660
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:33,929
Your Highness.

661
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,829
The man who opened the gates
and let in the undead...

662
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,230
turned out to be
a man named Kim Byung Soo.

663
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,369
Apparently, he is the right hand man
of Chief Magistrate Yim Tae Mi.

664
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,730
Bring him to me.

665
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,969
Torture him if you have to.

666
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,610
I must know why he opened the gates.

667
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,280
It will not be that easy, Your Highness.

668
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,349
What?

669
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,010
Hello, Your Highness.

670
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:26,809
Yim Tae Mi.

671
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,119
You are the chief magistrate
of the capital district...

672
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,349
and my father-in-law's friend.

673
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,389
Why are you trying to use the undead
to destroy Joseon?

674
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
I did it for you, Your Highness.

675
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:37,920
It was for me?

676
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,590
How so?

677
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,130
Let me hear what you have to say.

678
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,900
You started fooling around
with the previous king's concubine...

679
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:47,699
and brought Eo Ri to the women's quarters.

680
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,769
And I am sure you know
your actions have upset His Majesty.

681
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,340
The previous king was the eldest son,

682
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:54,670
but only after two years,

683
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,480
he stepped down
and passed on the throne to His Majesty.

684
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:00,710
The king of this country
is already the second son.

685
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,980
So no one will be able to raise an issue
even if Lord Choong Nyung...

686
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:05,990
ends up taking over the throne
instead of you.

687
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:07,150
Are you...

688
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,619
trying to come between me and my brother?

689
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,760
You have been the crown prince
for 13 years,

690
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,659
but have you ever thought of why
you still have not succeeded the throne?

691
00:57:19,329 --> 00:57:20,329
What?

692
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,969
You must regain His Majesty's trust.

693
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,240
You need to find out
whether they are humans or ghosts,

694
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:26,869
if they are dead or alive,

695
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:28,639
their strengths and weaknesses,

696
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,380
and what you need to do
to get rid of them.

697
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:33,280
You must find out and save
Kang Nyung before Choong Nyung does...

698
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,980
so you can finally become
the king of this country.

699
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:43,119
Your Highness.

700
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,990
I understand your loyalty.

701
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,059
But winning my father's trust...

702
00:57:52,699 --> 00:57:54,499
The reason I am going to listen
to your advice...

703
00:57:55,099 --> 00:57:56,999
is not because I wish
to gain His Majesty's trust.

704
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:00,070
It is because I wish to find out...

705
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,780
who brought the undead into this country.

706
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:06,749
- You had better not forget that.
- Of course, Your Highness.

707
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,349
Bring him out.

708
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:40,710
Good!

709
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,769
Listen up!

710
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:10,480
The two long-headed grasshoppers...

711
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,210
are jumping like gray mullets!

712
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,980
If they do well, then so be it.

713
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,179
But if they fail, they will die!

714
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:22,090
Now, let us hear the drums!

715
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:31,030
Move, move!

716
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,699
Move aside, everyone!

717
00:59:34,499 --> 00:59:37,769
Now, it is time for the highlight
of the festival.

718
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,070
The best talent of the show!

719
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:47,949
He will go ahead
and show you a great time!

720
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:55,260
Hurry up and follow me.

721
00:59:57,659 --> 00:59:59,030
He is totally absent-minded.

722
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,960
Did you see that?

723
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Your Majesty.

724
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,469
It has been a long time.

725
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

726
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,769
This is your first time coming here
after the incident at Hamju Fortress.

727
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,719
Do not let anyone inside.

728
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:09,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

729
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,990
Is this...

730
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:48,659
the last mirror
that will kill the evil spirit?

731
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:51,329
Yes.

732
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:55,670
Then I guess this will help us find out
if Lord Kang Nyung is possessed...

733
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,309
by the alpha
or just an ordinary evil spirit.

734
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:24,199
Are you Makchi?

735
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:27,429
No, I am not.

736
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:30,499
Makchi is locked up right now.

737
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:32,670
He is not here, Your Highness.

738
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,510
Is that so?

739
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:36,240
Then you can do the job instead.

740
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,749
Show him.

741
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,449
Goodness.

742
01:03:52,889 --> 01:03:53,889
Have him stand up.

743
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,769
Cut him open.

744
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,440
I apologize to say this, Your Highness.

745
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,240
But I am a mere blacksmith.

746
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,740
I have never cut open a human before.

747
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:11,110
I humbly request your punishment.

748
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,050
I said, cut him open.

749
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:35,969
I will do it instead.

750
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:40,539
Go ahead.

751
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,980
If you fail,

752
01:04:44,139 --> 01:04:45,849
you will end up gutted.

753
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,550
I kill livestock for a living.

754
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:52,550
The corpse of an undead
will not be a problem.

755
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,030
A non-beating heart
indicates no sign of life.

756
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,369
Yes. That is right, Your Highness.

757
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,559
How did a western evil spirit...

758
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,389
make an appearance in Joseon?

759
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,230
The answer to that...

760
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,730
will be better explained...

761
01:06:48,999 --> 01:06:50,670
by your grandfather
and your father, the current King.

762
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:02,449
Is it true...

763
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,079
that my grandfather, the former king,

764
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:07,949
and my father, the current king,
are responsible for bringing...

765
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:09,389
western undeads to Joseon?

766
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,619
Please tell me.

767
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,329
If it is for my father and this nation,

768
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:16,860
I am willing to put forth my life.

769
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,380
JOSEON EXORCIST

770
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,679
WE THANK YOON JE MOON, DAVID MCINNIS,
HONG SEOK BIN, AND HONG JI HEE...

771
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,110
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE.

772
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:20,289
<i>He will last three days at most.</i>

773
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:23,429
<i>Choong Nyung will not be back
with the western exorcist by then.</i>

774
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:25,299
<i>- The undead are coming.
- They are after something else.</i>

775
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,099
<i>- Kill her!
- Your Highness!</i>

776
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:29,969
<i>Rumor has it that dozens of undeads...</i>

777
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,040
<i>are trapped in a mirror
at the official mudang.</i>

778
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:35,269
<i>Then obtaining the mirror will give you
the power to command the evil spirits.</i>

779
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:37,679
<i>- I am the next king of Joseon.
- Kill me.</i>

780
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:39,750
<i>You were ordered
to tighten security measures!</i>

781
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,620
<i>How could you have let them
get past these walls?</i>

782
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,950
<i>Are you even aware
of the rumor going around?</i>

783
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,549
<i>What is your take on it?</i>

784
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,450
<i>I asked if you believed the rumor too.</i>

785
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,530
MONDAY NIGHT 10PM

786
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:59,599
JOSEON EXORCIST
