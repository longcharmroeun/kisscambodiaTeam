HAMJU FORTRESS

6
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,830
HAMJU FORTRESS:
PRESENT DAY HAMHEUNG FORTRESS

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,069
TAE JONG YI BANG WON:
3RD KING OF JOSEON DYNASTY

8
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:21,979
Your Highness.

9
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,249
What we saw at Gaema Plateau...

10
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,570
If they get out of here,

11
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,830
Joseon will be no more.

12
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,969
We must find the leader and behead it.

13
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,490
Leave it.

14
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:00,650
Give up your lives...

15
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,490
and protect Joseon!

16
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,020
Protect the Majesty!

17
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,619
BE OUR GUARDIAN AGAINST
THE MALICE AND TRICKS OF SATAN.

18
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,119
DISAPPEAR!

19
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,990
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON,
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT, AMEN.

20
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,770
DEFEND THOSE IN BATTLE.

21
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,270
BE OUR GUARDIAN AGAINST
THE MALICE AND TRICKS OF SATAN.

22
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:02,080
LOOK AT OUR FATHER'S CROSS!

23
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,909
LOOK AT OUR FATHER'S CROSS!

24
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,239
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

25
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,669
Bang Won.

26
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,580
Bang Won.

27
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,580
Bang Won.

28
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Father?

29
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,060
Your Majesty, pull yourself together.

30
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,830
You must break from the ghost of Azazel.

31
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,370
Do not be stupid.

32
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,669
That is my father.

33
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,549
Your Majesty.

34
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,279
Bang Won.

35
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:29,820
This is your brother Bang Seok's blood.

36
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:31,460
LEE BANG SEOK: TAE JONG'S YOUNGEST
BROTHER WHOM HE KILLED TO BECOME KING.

37
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,400
Azazel.

38
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:43,270
You dare insult my father?

39
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,210
I will kill you for this.

40
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:40,960
Bang Won.

41
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,669
You killed your brother
with your own hands.

42
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,039
The same will happen to your sons.

43
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:30,479
Your Majesty!

44
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,549
Please calm down!

45
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,949
That is not your late father!

46
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,020
Your Majesty!

47
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,850
- Calm down!
- Your Majesty!

48
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,260
DEAR FATHER IN HEAVEN.

49
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,569
YOUR NAME SHINES IN GLORY.

50
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,799
MAY YOUR KINGDOM COME,

51
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,939
SO YOUR WILL BE DONE ON EARTH
AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.

52
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,709
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD.

53
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,250
WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED US.

54
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,520
FORGIVE US OUR SINS,

55
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,220
DO NOT LET US FALL INTO TEMPTATION,

56
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,590
AND SAVE US FROM EVIL. AMEN.

57
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,299
I...

58
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,970
killed the undead.

59
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,110
To save Joseon...

60
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,840
I killed the undead.

61
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,240
10 YEARS LATER

62
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,559
NEARBY UIJU, NEAR THE FRONTIERS OF MING

63
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,220
Your... Your Highness.

64
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:00,919
- Ji Gyeom.
- Your Highness.

65
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:09,329
- Why is this...
- Let... Let go...

66
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Your Highness.

67
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,010
CHANGDEOKGUNG PALACE, HANYANG

68
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,579
Yang Nyung tells me to be strict.

69
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,220
And Choong Nyung tells me to be gentle.

70
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,789
I listened to them both.

71
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,890
They say the father should be strict,
and the mother should be gentle.

72
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,159
You are right, Your Highness.

73
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,770
Today is the day my hawk
ends its training...

74
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,199
and goes hunting for the first time.

75
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,169
I wanted to go with both my brothers,

76
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,510
so it is a pity.

77
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,539
You can think of today as practice.

78
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,480
If your hawk successfully
finishes its hunt,

79
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,819
you can show it to them then.

80
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,279
Okay.

81
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,720
I cannot wait to find out
what they have to say about it.

82
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:13,929
There we go.

83
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,640
Okay, Haedong.

84
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,579
Go fly!

85
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:42,689
Your... Your Highness!
You... You are bleeding!

86
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,400
It is okay. I have been hurt a lot worse.

87
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,230
But still...

88
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,199
My hawk must have spotted a prey already.

89
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,409
Yes! Go on, Haedong!

90
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,510
- Go get it!
- Your Highness!

91
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,250
Your Highness!

92
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,260
Go and check what it is
that Haedong caught.

93
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,720
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
What is it?

95
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,990
What did Haedong catch?

96
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:51,990
Is it a rat?

97
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,059
Sa Gi.

98
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,750
Your Highness.

99
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,250
Your Highness, you must go.

100
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,429
What are you doing?
Escort his Highness right now!

101
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,909
Your Highness, you must run.

102
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,150
You must run away right now!

103
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,220
Your Highness, you need to go!

104
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,419
Your Highness!

105
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,590
How dare you!

106
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,530
Stay still.

107
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,580
Have you forgotten
that I am equivalent to the skies?

108
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,530
If you add...

109
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,669
a stroke to the word "sky",
it turns into the word "husband".

110
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,439
Today, I am your husband,

111
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,640
so you can be the one lying down.

112
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,179
Minister of War, you are here.

113
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,159
- Tell him I am here.
- The thing is...

114
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,759
You pathetic punk.

115
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:46,060
You should know what is best
for His Highness.

116
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,300
Your Highness, it is I,
the minister of war. I will go inside.

117
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,580
What brings my father-in-law
all the way here?

118
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,209
Did your daughter tell you to check...

119
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,179
whom I am having an affair with?

120
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,810
I am not here as my daughter's father.

121
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,550
I am here to see you
as the minister of war...

122
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,449
and your loyal subject.

123
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,749
Defending the fortress was the first thing
His Majesty ordered...

124
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,090
after he became King.

125
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,800
You have been spending the past year
pleasing His Majesty.

126
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,729
And now you are suddenly
acting like you are my loyal subject?

127
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,669
From how I see it,

128
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,310
it looks like you came
to keep an eye on me...

129
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:34,209
because you are scared
she might get pregnant with a prince...

130
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,880
and squeeze out the child
that your daughter gave birth to.

131
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,479
Is that correct?

132
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,419
It has only been two days
since His Majesty banned everyone...

133
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,320
from holding festivals
and drinking alcohol.

134
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,929
You talk as if you have
many lives to spare.

135
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,729
If you die
while taking His Majesty's side,

136
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:03,469
do you think anyone will be able
to help you come back to life?

137
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,979
I am not the person
you should be trying to kill.

138
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,409
If you want to inherit the throne
and become the king,

139
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,249
you need to kill those who have
disappeared from Bakseok hill.

140
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,550
A monstrous being...

141
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,890
that sucked the blood of its own child
has appeared in Bakseok hill.

142
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,459
MONSTROUS BEING: AN UNKNOWN CREATURE
THAT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN IN WORDS

143
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,159
They are dead but alive,

144
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,390
so the commoners call it the "undead".

145
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,630
"The undead"?

146
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,229
That is not all.

147
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,370
The mother and children
who got bitten by the undead...

148
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,100
also turned into the same creatures.

149
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,469
They eventually sucked the blood
of their neighbors...

150
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,570
and turned the entire area
into a place  filled with the undead.

151
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,570
Father.

152
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,699
Father...

153
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:39,560
Seok Joong.

154
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,570
No one...

155
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,939
should know about
what happened here today.

156
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,219
The first order my father gave
after returning...

158
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,679
was the reinforcement
of the fort security?

159
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,150
Yes, Your Highness.

160
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,390
Lord Choong Nyung sneaked out after him...

161
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,620
and was nearly harmed.

162
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,330
Why on earth would he...

163
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,999
So how is he? Is he all right?

164
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,729
From what I hear, His Majesty
ordered him to Uiju.

165
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,800
Uiju? Why there of all places?

166
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,939
It probably has to do with the undead.

167
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,610
What do these so-called "undead"...

168
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,110
look like anyway?

169
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,209
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

170
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,580
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

171
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,090
- Was someone hurt?
- Goodness, me.

172
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:40,989
Are you all right?

173
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,090
You imbeciles must have a death will.

174
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:46,330
Have you forgotten
who occupies this carriage?

175
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,729
Forgive me, sir.

176
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,900
But the carriage kept getting heavier.

177
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:50,929
He's right.

178
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,269
I'd say we were carrying a mountain.

179
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,999
You idiots.

180
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,600
Only the lady
and her newborn are in there.

181
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Who could have added more weight to it?

182
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:00,909
Lift it back up this instant!

183
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,979
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,540
All right. Here we go.

185
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,150
1, 2, 3.

186
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,620
SOOKCHUNG GATE

187
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,090
- Where are you coming from?
- Yangju, Your Highness.

188
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:19,229
Where in Yangju?

189
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,290
Gupabal, Your Highness.

190
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:22,659
Gupabal right next to Bakseok Hill?

191
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,999
Yes, but why do you ask...

192
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,300
I am the butler for Minister Ha.

193
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,040
His daughter-in-law went to her parents'
to have her child...

194
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,969
and we were escorting her back.

195
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,340
Her condition worsened though,
so we were hurrying.

196
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,550
Even the noble are subjects of the nation.

197
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,350
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but the lady is tremendously sick

198
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
and her child's life is touch and go.

199
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:46,390
Please let us hurry through.

200
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,159
Ha Won Ik is the son of Lord Ha,
a founding contributor,

201
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,130
and a supporter of your abdication.

202
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,489
They should be let through.

203
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:57,929
If that is the case...

204
00:24:57,969 --> 00:24:59,800
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you.

205
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,640
Don't just sit there. Carry the lady in.

206
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,669
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

207
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,239
All right.

208
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,179
Stop right there.

209
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,459
This is the smell of a corpse's blood.

210
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:28,999
Why would it be dripping
from this carriage?

211
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,800
Lower the carriage.

212
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,469
Your Highness, please.

213
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,469
Move! Your Highness!

214
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,749
- Your Highness.
- What are you doing here?

215
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:24,850
The Queen ordered your return
to Changdeokgung Palace.

216
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,489
My mother? What for?

217
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,229
His Majesty announced
the beheading of Lord Kang Nyung.

218
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,560
What?

219
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,199
Keep this carriage where it is...

220
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,729
and escort Eo Ri home.

221
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,070
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Come.

222
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,739
But Your Highness!

223
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:45,610
What will we do now?

224
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,179
My lady, bear a few moments.

225
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,679
I'll notify the Lord beyond the gates.

226
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,110
- Gi Bok.
- Yes?

227
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,380
Find the lord within the castle...

228
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,979
and notify him
of the lady's severe condition.

229
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,790
Ask him to make a path for her. Hurry.

230
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,850
Yes, sir!

231
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Father!

232
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,459
Please spare my life.

233
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,659
This is not because I do not love you.

234
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,729
But to save the entirety of Joseon,

235
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:44,999
this must be done.

236
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,570
Now, let me proceed.

237
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:51,469
No, you cannot do this, Your Majesty.

238
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,209
My Queen.

239
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,439
Mu Gu, Mu Ji, Mu Hyul,
and the youngest Mu Ui.

240
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,150
Has killing my brothers
not been enough for you?

241
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:02,919
Must I witness you killing
my youngest son too?

242
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,719
You know very well
what happens to those...

243
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,659
bitten by the undead.

244
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:11,659
Now, move.

245
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,159
Look at him, Your Majesty.

246
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,600
In what way does he look
like an undead to you?

247
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,469
See it with your own eyes!

248
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:23,499
Show her your hand.

249
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,909
Show her the back of your hand.

250
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,860
Mother, it is not true.

251
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,199
I was only scratched by Haedong.

252
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,669
When I set Haedong into the air,

253
00:28:57,939 --> 00:29:00,169
it accidentally scratched
the back of my hand.

254
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,179
Mother!

255
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:10,120
Mother, I do not want to die. Mother!

256
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,650
Look, Your Majesty.

257
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,050
He was injured more than two hours ago.

258
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,959
All he has are bruises though. He's fine.

259
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,530
The undead is something
you can't possibly fathom!

260
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:21,759
You're wrong!

261
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,729
Back in 1408, I heard there were people...

262
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,469
who did not transform
after being exposed to the disease.

263
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,400
Am I wrong?

264
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,469
Your Majesty,

265
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:35,840
we will soon be in the heart of winter.

266
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,850
Please give him until early spring.

267
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,880
We will have Choong Nyung bring
the western exorcist to the palace...

268
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,419
and have him cure our son.

269
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,519
If you cannot allow that,

270
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,959
then kill me first
if you wish to end his life.

271
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,860
Go through me first!

272
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,280
You have only until
Choong Nyung gets here.

273
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,590
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

274
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,959
Mother...

275
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,159
It is all right, my son.

276
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,330
It will be all right.

277
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
My son.

278
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,580
Bring ice from the seobinggo to slow down
the progression of the disease.

279
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,610
No one is to be near him.

280
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,050
Anyone...

281
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,080
who goes against my words will be
heavily punished regardless of rank.

282
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:49,280
I came as soon as I heard
of Kang Nyung's accident.

284
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:05,429
I ordered you to reinforce
the security of the fortress,

285
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,499
but you are still drunk on
wine, women, and dice.

286
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,370
How pathetic.

287
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
That is right.

288
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:19,769
This pathetic son indulged in a drink.

289
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,580
The undead surface out of nowhere...

290
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,050
to threaten the fate of this nation,

291
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,620
but its crown prince...

292
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,159
is kept in the dark
defending a mere fortress.

293
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,459
The humiliation manifested into anger,
so I drank.

294
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,959
Is that not allowed?

295
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,400
The undead that made it
into Changdeokgung Palace.

296
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,249
It was a military officer from Yangju.

297
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:04,050
If you had done your job
securing the gates,

298
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,919
this wouldn't have happened!

299
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,330
Your younger brother
was attacked by an undead!

300
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,040
If you had told me what the undead are,

301
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:24,870
I would have made sure
nothing got past me.

302
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,110
So today's event happened...

303
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,340
because I did not inform you
of the danger?

304
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,110
I am your son
and the crown prince of the nation.

305
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,749
Even if all I do is
drink, chase skirts, and hunt,

306
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,249
I should have at least been
the first brother to know...

307
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,989
about a danger that may threaten
this nation's existence.

308
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,989
That is one lousy excuse coming
from someone who fooled around...

309
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,900
with his grandfather's concubine
and with a noble's concubine...

310
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,769
named Eo Ri.

311
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,499
Also,

312
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:01,110
whom I inform first is my choice to make.

313
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,660
Guard.

314
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,360
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,229
Find whoever opened the South Gate...

316
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,360
out of the guards
who were on patrol last night.

317
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,869
The same goes to anyone
who was involved or turned a blind eye.

318
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,900
I will slay...

319
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,939
each and every one of them.

320
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,529
This is Father John
who was sent by Pope Gregory XII...

321
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,600
upon the request of Father Nicholas...

322
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,960
and the King of Joseon.

323
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:03,469
I am the interpreter Marco.

324
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,400
FATHER.

325
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,770
And this is a letter sent
by Pope Gregory XII himself.

326
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:19,080
Thank you for making
this long and exhausting trip.

327
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:22,610
I dare express my gratitude...

328
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,650
on behalf of the King and Joseon.

329
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,619
HE'S GRATEFUL.

330
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,319
- Is that it?
- Their language is kept simple.

331
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:45,869
He wants you to tell him
about the recent events.

332
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:49,139
At a place called Bakseok Hill,
monstrous beings...

333
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,170
who suck the blood of people emerged.

334
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:53,779
How is it that they wake up after dying...

335
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,650
and suck the blood of the living?
Please ask him.

336
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,119
I see you people
call them "monstrous beings".

337
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,589
How dare you.

338
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,989
You will speak with respect
when addressing His Highness.

339
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,190
How dare you!

340
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,500
You are the one
who is showing disrespect!

341
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,830
Father John and I
are messengers of the pope...

342
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,139
and have traveled
miles across land and sea...

343
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,000
upon the request of your king
to perform exorcism.

344
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,040
So who do you think
you are pointing your sword at?

345
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,179
Can I assume
you are acting as the King's proxy?

346
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,449
How dare you!

347
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,489
You dare yell at him?

348
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,719
Ji Gyeom.

349
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,330
The interpreter is right.

350
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,929
You will apologize, Ji Gyeom.

351
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,969
I am...sorry.

352
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,310
- Is that it?
- What?

353
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,480
I asked if that is all you have to say.

354
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,319
He is an exorcist of the Vatican
who traveled miles across land and sea.

355
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:08,619
Your Highness?

356
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:09,949
MARCO.

357
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,989
THAT'S ENOUGH.

358
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,360
PLEASE TELL HIM THAT WE SHOULD HURRY
TO HAMJU FORTRESS.

359
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:19,360
Tell him that we should
go to Hanyang, not Hamju Fortress.

360
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,100
Hamju, Hanyang, or what not.

361
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,270
Do you really think you will get away
after treating...

362
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,369
the western exorcist like this?

363
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:39,850
I am finally here.

364
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,619
I will be partying with
a couple of gisaengs by my side tonight.

365
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,549
FATHER,

366
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,520
LET'S HURRY IN. COME ON.

367
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:50,429
I am here. It is me, Mak...

368
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,529
I mean, it is me, Marco!

369
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,630
Here, here!

370
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,730
Is anyone here?

371
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,239
Did they all go for a walk?

372
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,440
Come hither!

373
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,020
Call my mother.

374
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,960
I said call my mother!

375
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,690
Mother!

376
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:27,900
Choong Nyung!

377
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,299
The eunuchs and court maids
that were bitten.

378
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,270
Were there any other witnesses?

379
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:38,239
Fortunately, they were the only ones.

380
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,540
Seok Joong.

381
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,779
What do you think?

382
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,750
I am sorry to say this...

383
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:46,679
HONG SEOK JOONG, CHIEF ROYAL SECRETARY

384
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:49,449
But behead Lord Kang Nyung
before it is too late.

385
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,319
The undead on Bakseok Hill
were eliminated swiftly,

386
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,190
so we were able to prevent
word from spreading.

387
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,360
But if you let Lord Kang Nyung live,
how will you control...

388
00:39:58,389 --> 00:39:59,830
the numerous witnesses within the palace?

389
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,929
It is only a matter of time before
rumors that the plague is back...

390
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,199
spreads within Hanyang.

391
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,839
Let us wait only until
Choong Nyung returns.

392
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,040
Your Majesty.

393
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:14,339
Do not think you can do what you did
at Hamju Fortress in 1408.

394
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,009
These undead...

395
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,210
are different.

396
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,589
Do you have wine?

397
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,290
My mouth turns dry
if I do not have wine each day.

398
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,670
Your Highness. I heard Western exorcists
are like Buddhist monks.

399
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,369
They do not marry
and stay away from women and drink.

400
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,270
Could these two be frauds?

401
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,009
I am not sure about women,

402
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:49,750
but I heard they drink alcohol
made with western grapes.

403
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,250
That interpreter called Malko or Marco...

404
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,420
would even enjoy a gisaeng's company.

405
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:56,920
Shall I teach him a lesson?

406
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,489
He has been wandering foreign countries
after he lost his own.

407
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,319
How could he be favorable towards us?

408
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:04,489
Let that slide.

409
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:05,860
But how can you,

410
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,560
a prince, enter a gisaeng's room
with that interpreter?

411
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,230
My great-great-grandfather King Mokjo...

412
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,000
eloped to Samcheok
for the love of a gisaeng.

413
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,199
His blood flows in my veins.

414
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,940
Are you saying...

415
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:24,380
I can never come to power.

416
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:26,219
Before I get on Yang Nyung's bad side,

417
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:29,150
I am considering taking up
on alcohol and women.

418
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,659
Will you teach me a few things, Ji Gyeom?

419
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:39,159
I am not an expert,
but I know pretty much...

420
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,770
I apologize. This is my first time also.

421
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,889
Father. What are all those things?

422
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:13,199
The one who knows that is coming to Uiju.

423
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,369
You will get the answer from him.

424
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,869
Am I allowed to go...

425
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,940
instead of Yang Nyung?

426
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,610
It is not a task...

427
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,639
for the Crown Prince.

428
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,449
I understand.

429
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,920
I will bring that man safely to Hanyang.

430
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,699
Where is the next course?

431
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,009
Is there not enough food?

432
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,369
Why are you so old-fashioned?

433
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:34,110
Hey.

434
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,449
Call the head gisaeng.

435
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,380
HEAD GISAENG: THE GISAENG
WITH THE HIGHEST RANK

436
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:59,440
What are you doing? Come on out.

437
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:38,589
Who is it?

438
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,440
Is the man who went to get the gisaeng
playing house with her?

439
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,949
Hey. You go and get her.

440
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,790
"Monstrous beings".

441
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,989
What does that mean?

442
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,130
Confucius said one must not speak of
monsters or insurgents.

443
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,330
A wise ruler should not...

444
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,699
speak of beings with strange powers
or those who disrupt order.

445
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,199
That is Confucius' teaching,

446
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:24,270
and that is why
we call strange entities by that term.

447
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:28,480
"Pater"?

448
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,480
Pater? Do you speak Latin?

449
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,920
That is what you say to him,

450
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,119
so I assumed he's called "Pater".

451
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:39,759
So I said it.

452
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,159
I see. Anyway,

453
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:49,699
you have a very quick mind.

454
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:04,810
He thinks they are spirits
that came to Goryeo...

455
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,279
through merchants from the west.

456
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,420
Then if we catch the spirit,

457
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,489
can those who were possessed
return to normal?

458
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:16,259
- Of course.
- Is that true?

459
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,529
Then the people who were
bitten by the undead at Bakseok Hill...

460
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,869
can all be saved.

461
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,500
That is good. That is very good.

462
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,339
Hey. If you got what you wanted,

463
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,810
you should satisfy me now.

464
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:39,049
Since no one will help,
I must find her myself.

465
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,719
Not you. The pretty one.

466
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,339
LOOK AT OUR FATHER'S CROSS.
I COMMAND YOU.

467
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,509
UNCLEAN SPIRIT, DISAPPEAR!

468
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,250
UNCLEAN SPIRIT, DISAPPEAR!

469
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:14,880
Right now!

470
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,219
SHOW YOURSELF, YOU DEMON!

471
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,489
WHO ARE YOU?

472
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:22,489
DEMON! SHOW YOURSELF!

473
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:31,869
I COMMAND YOU
IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST,

474
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,699
YOUR IMPURE SOUL DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU!

475
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:38,770
LEAVE THIS BODY RIGHT NOW.

476
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,790
Is this the same creature
from Bakseok Hill?

477
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,119
Yes, it seems so, Your Majesty.

478
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,089
How did it manage to come this far?

479
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,940
MY LORD, THE CREATOR
AND PROTECTOR OF MANKIND.

480
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,739
HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SERVANTS
WHOM YOU HAVE CREATED IN YOUR OWN FORM,

481
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,040
AND PROTECT US FROM THIS BATTLE.

482
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,110
I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF GOD,
LEAVE THIS WOMAN'S BODY!

483
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,210
GO BURN IN HELL!

484
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:32,960
Did you see that?

485
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,900
This is what you call exorcism.

486
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,170
Father John is a top-class priest
from the Vatican,

487
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,199
and it is something
that only he can perform.

488
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,549
Your Highness.

489
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,799
Your Highness!

490
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,639
Your Highness!

491
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:56,110
What did you just do?

492
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:59,110
Why did you behead this woman?

493
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,449
I saved you from trouble,

494
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,949
and you are asking me why?

495
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:06,020
You fools.

496
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,560
You should have thought of a way
to save her!

497
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,130
Beheading them is the only way
to kill them.

498
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,929
You talk as if you know another way
to save them.

499
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,909
Your Highness! Your Highness!

500
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,980
His Majesty is here.

501
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:56,540
Father.

502
00:52:57,569 --> 00:52:59,310
I am scared, Father.

503
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,909
Take the shaman away.

504
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,449
She is Mu Hwa,
the official shaman of the palace.

505
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:11,790
I asked the best shaman in Joseon
to cure him.

506
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,360
Why would you tell them to take her away?

507
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:15,520
If the best shaman in Joseon
could get rid of them,

508
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,029
we would have done so already.

509
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,060
Then are you saying...

510
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:19,929
Do not do anything...

511
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,230
until Choong Nyung comes back.

512
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,170
What are you doing?

513
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,100
Escort her back to her palace.

514
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,339
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:35,040
Let us go, Your Majesty.

516
00:53:50,259 --> 00:53:53,299
What did you do to the bodies
of the court maids and eunuchs...

517
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,630
who got bitten in Changdeokgung Palace?

518
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,600
We beheaded everyone
and burned their bodies...

519
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,130
regardless of whether or not
they were still alive.

520
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:02,299
Then I ordered them to bury their bodies
10km away from the palace.

521
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:14,819
As of this moment,

522
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,889
I want you to shut all the city gates...

523
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,960
including the gates of the palace.

524
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,219
Do not let anyone inside...

525
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,460
until Choong Nyung returns.

526
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,130
If anyone disobeys this order,

527
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,000
I will behead you first.

528
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:32,100
So you had better keep that in mind.
Do you understand?

529
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:36,270
But Your Majesty, if we ban the city
from letting in goods from the suburbs,

530
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,540
the people in the city will not
be able to last three days.

531
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,480
What is it that is inside
Lord Kang Nyung's body?

532
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:44,650
Why must you give such strict orders?

533
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:46,719
By any chance,

534
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,219
does this have anything to do
with the court maids and eunuchs...

535
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,420
that got bitten and lost their lives
inside Changdeokgung Palace?

536
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,089
Do not ask any more questions.

537
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
The fate of Joseon lies in this matter.

538
00:54:57,159 --> 00:54:58,560
I must go to Mount Samgak.

539
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,159
Hong Seok Joong,
I want you to come with me.

540
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,029
As for the chief state councilor
and Jo Hae Ryung,

541
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,869
I want you to strengthen
the security of the fortress.

542
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,199
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

543
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:09,139
Father!

544
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,310
Father!

545
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:31,790
GWANGHWAMUN GATE

546
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,560
What do you think you are doing?

547
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:37,600
Your Highness.

548
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,540
Are you okay?

549
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:48,279
What?

550
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,650
Do you think your men will help you?

551
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,049
What have you done?

552
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,520
What happened to our men?

553
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:59,319
By any chance, are they the creatures
that appeared ten years ago...

554
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,119
at Hamju Fortress?

555
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,429
I heard those who suffered
from the plague...

556
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,460
sucked the blood of humans
just like they did.

557
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:08,929
Who are you people?

558
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:15,040
We saved your life,

559
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:16,969
so let us take Wang Yu.

560
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:19,139
You just need to stay out of it.

561
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,810
That will solve everything.

562
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:22,509
What are you talking about?

563
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,509
Have you lost your minds?

564
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,310
He is not Wang Yu.

565
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,520
He is Lord Choong Nyung,
the third prince of His Majesty!

566
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,259
Cut the nonsense!

567
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:47,239
Do you think the king is dumb?

568
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,069
What kind of king...

569
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:54,179
would send his own son
off to chase those monsters?

570
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,009
You are being absurd, you punk.

571
00:56:57,179 --> 00:57:00,719
Listen to that fool talk nonsense.

572
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,920
What nonsense.

573
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,020
Did you not hear what I just...

574
00:57:05,049 --> 00:57:06,049
Ji Gyeom.

575
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,989
Put your sword down. They have a point.

576
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:16,000
I am here because I am the third in line.

577
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
My eldest brother is the crown prince
who is courageous and brave...

578
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,900
and in the next line to take the throne.

579
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:26,509
And my second brother is Lord Hyo Ryeong,
a brother who has a generous heart.

580
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,150
Therefore, as His Majesty's third son,

581
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,250
my job is to make sure
the crown prince stays safe...

582
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,080
so that he can safely
take over the throne.

583
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,549
That is my duty,

584
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,259
and I will be discarded after that.
That is why I am here.

585
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,759
Does that answer your question?

586
00:57:51,029 --> 00:57:52,699
How could you say that, Your Highness?

587
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,369
You are breaking my heart.

588
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,600
That is merely the truth.

589
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,670
If you are looking for Wang Yu,

590
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,080
you must be looking for the child
that was born between...

591
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,580
King Gong Yang and his concubine.

592
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,179
I am sorry to tell you
that I am not the man you are looking for.

593
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,889
Judging by what he just said,
he must really be a prince.

594
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,560
Do you not agree?

595
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,529
Hye Yum.

596
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,750
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

597
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,719
He looks nothing like Wang Yu.

598
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,060
I apologize.

599
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,259
We saved your life,
so I hope that makes up for this.

600
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,400
Watch how you speak to His Highness.

601
00:58:59,429 --> 00:59:00,440
That is enough.

602
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,710
He is right.
We owe him for saving our lives.

603
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,440
We were able to live thanks to you.

604
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,980
Thank you.

605
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,480
Thank you for your boundless generosity.
Your Highness.

606
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,949
- Thank you for your boundless generosity.
- Thank you for your boundless generosity.

607
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,719
Thanks.

608
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:22,420
We will go back to where we belong,
Your Highness.

609
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,230
Come on!

610
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:27,560
- I can't believe this.
- Unbelievable.

611
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,799
What is he blabbering at a corpse for?

612
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:35,940
Let's go.

613
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,110
Ji Gyeom.

614
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:46,380
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON,
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT...

615
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,389
Brother.

616
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:26,819
Don't you worry.

617
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,920
I'll figure out a way.

618
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,460
Please. Please do so.

619
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:35,929
Yang Nyung, I'm terrified.

620
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,270
Your Highness, there seems to be
an incident at Sookchung Gate.

621
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,770
What?

622
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:17,770
Marco.

623
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,040
DEFEND THOSE IN BATTLE.

624
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,739
BE OUR GUARDIAN AGAINST
THE MALICE AND TRICKS OF SATAN.

625
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:00,549
"Our guardian"?

626
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,719
Don't just stand there. Hold him down.

627
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:12,360
SHOW YOURSELF, DEVIL.

628
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,699
WHO ARE YOU?

629
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:21,170
MAY THE EVIL SPIRIT SHOW ITSELF.

630
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,940
We are 1 and 10...

631
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,110
as well as 100 and 1,000.

632
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,679
ENOUGH WITH THE NONSENSE. SHOW YOURSELF!

633
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,080
DEVIL, TELL ME YOUR NAME.

634
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:44,460
We are the soldiers of Azazel.

635
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,290
"The soldiers of Azazel"?

636
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,710
Your Highness, are you all right?

637
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:27,360
Guard.

638
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:29,690
Yes, Your Highness.

639
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,029
Minister Ha's daughter-in-law is missing.

640
01:06:57,509 --> 01:07:01,650
IN THE NAME OF GOD,
I ORDER YOU TO LEAVE HIS BODY!

641
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:04,250
GO BURN IN HELL!

642
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,000
Did you see that?

643
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,500
This is what we call the "grand exorcism".

644
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:53,770
GRAND EXORCISM: AN EXORCISM
THAT ONLY THOSE SELECTED...

645
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:54,839
BY THE BISHOP CAN PERFORM

646
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:59,469
I think I heard the word "Azazel."

647
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,940
What exactly is that?

648
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,850
Azazel is the alpha
of western evil spirits...

649
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,219
also known as the Devil of the Wind.

650
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:13,250
"The alpha of evil spirits"?

651
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:16,360
How did it make it to Joseon?

652
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:19,830
How did a western evil spirit...

653
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,429
make an appearance in Joseon?

654
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,929
The answer to that...

655
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,709
will be better explained...

656
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,709
by your grandfather
and your father, the current King.

657
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,410
JOSEON EXORCIST

658
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,509
WE THANK KIM ROI HA, AHN KIL KANG,
KIM JUNG HO, AND DAVID MCINNIS...

659
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:09,740
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE.

660
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:24,429
<i>Rumor has it that His Majesty
summoned the undead.</i>

661
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,290
<i>Is that vile rumor actually true?</i>

662
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:29,130
<i>And still you expect to be
respectively treated as the crown prince?</i>

663
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,429
<i>Who would ever question
Lord Choong Nyung being chosen...</i>

664
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,870
<i>as the heir instead of you?</i>

665
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:34,970
<i>You must regain His Majesty's trust first.</i>

666
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,200
<i>The alpha of evil spirits?</i>

667
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:37,910
<i>What kind of a being is it?</i>

668
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,769
<i>It's the alpha of all evil spirits
that command the dead...</i>

669
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:41,080
<i>as well as the living.</i>

670
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,840
<i>I am sure you recognize this blade.</i>

671
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,349
<i>I do not follow. I am Kang Nyung, Father.</i>

672
01:09:45,521 --> 01:09:48,530
<i>An undead seems to have
gotten beyond the gates.</i>

673
01:09:48,962 --> 01:09:53,285
TOMORROW NIGHT 10PM
