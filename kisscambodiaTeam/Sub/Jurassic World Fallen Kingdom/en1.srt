we amassed landmark

will take preventative action

to protect the dinosaurs
on Isla Nublar.

164

After thorough deliberations,

165
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,451
the committee has resolved not to
recommend any legislative action

And while, of course, we feel
great sympathy for these animals,

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,966

Yes, this is Claire Dearing.

Benjamin Lockwood's estate.

Ms. Dearing, you're early.

00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,113
Would you like to step in?

187
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,531
Thank you.

188
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,497
I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.

189
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,646
MILLS: John Alfred Hammond,
the father of Jurassic Park.

190
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,313
But of course you knew that.

191
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,075
Hello, Claire. I'm Eli Mills.
I work for Ben Lockwood.

192
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,239
We actually met once,
seven, eight years ago,

193
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,492
- and you don't remember.
- Of course I remember.

194
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,661
- Haven't you run his foundation since...
- Since college, yeah.

195
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,287
- You remember?
- Yes.

196
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,834
- Wow. Cool.
- (CHUCKLES)

197

He wanted someone young and
idealistic to spend his fortune

198
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,381
and I used to be both.

199
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,549
(BOTH LAUGH)

200
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,176
Follow me.

201
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,634
Let me give you
a bit of history.

202
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,215
This is where it all began.

203
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,476
Before the island,
Sorna, Jurassic Park, all of it.

204
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,014
Hammond and Lockwood built a
custom lab in the sub-basement,

205
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,900
extracted the first DNA from
amber right beneath our feet.

206
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,777
Oh, my goodness.

207
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,025
What they did here
was a miracle.

208
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,278
I still believe that.

209
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,942
So do I, Claire.

210
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,360
So do I.

211
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,789
And I still believe it matters
what happens to those animals.

212
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,164
There is something Mr. Lockwood would
very much like you to do, Claire.

213
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,830
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

214
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,341
We have a piece of land.

215
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,877
A sanctuary protected
by natural barriers,

216
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,878
fully self-sustaining.

217
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,800
A new home where the dinosaurs
will be secure and free.

218
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,058
CLAIRE: You're gonna
get them out?

219
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,765
You're gonna save them?

220
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,474
BENJAMIN: No, Ms. Dearing.

221
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,522
I'm going to save us.

222
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,855
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

223
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,107
Lovely to see you again.

224
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,692
And you, Mr. Lockwood.

225
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,985
BENJAMIN: This was all
John Hammond's dream.

226
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,779
To let these creatures
live in peace.

227
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,574
So, we have created sanctuary.

228
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,330
No fences. No cages.

229
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,453
No tourists.

230
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,838
Just as Mother Nature intended.

231
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,715
John said it best.

232
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,503
"These creatures
don't need our protection.

233
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,555
"They need our absence."

234
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,436
When we were young,
we both shared this passion,

235
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,020
John and I.

236
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,645
What fools we were,

237
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,605
trying to run before
we'd learned to walk.

238
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,989
As all young men do, I suppose.

239
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,948
But we learned.

240
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,196
Unfortunately, in the end,

241
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,406
it drove us apart.

242
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,005
Life teaches us
some very hard lessons,

243
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,289
doesn't it, Claire?

244
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,501
Yes.

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,586

- Sir Benjamin.

00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,966

248
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,766
Will you excuse me, Claire?

249
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,843
Of course.

250
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,558
BENJAMIN: Eli here will
help you with the details.

251
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,223
We will save them.

252
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,309
What a gift

253
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,521
for our children.

254
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,440
Thank you.

255
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,158

Was there a little girl?

259
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,457
His daughter died
in a car accident.

260

That's awful.

261
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,666
Yeah, I know, but they're very close.
Really close.

262
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,011
So, what do you need from me?

263
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,968
MILLS: There was a tracking
system in place at your park.

264
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,099
Radio-frequency ID chips
in each dinosaur.

265
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,301
- I remember.
- Right.

266
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,095
MILLS: So, if we could
access that system,

267
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,014
our ability to locate and
capture those animals safely

268
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,565
would increase tenfold.

269
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,147
We need your handprint
to access the system,

270
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,104
but what I really need, Claire,

271
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,814
is you.

272
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,658
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal,

273
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,284
but it's the right thing to do.

274
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,953
No one knows this park
as well as you do

275
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,326
and we need that expertise.

276
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,034
- How many can you save?
- Eleven species. For sure.

277
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,379
I mean, more if we can,
but time is against us.

278
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,216
I'm afraid there is
one animal in particular

279
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,759
that poses a real challenge
for us.

280
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,592
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name,

281
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,348
but Blue is potentially

282
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,721
the second-most intelligent
piece of life on this planet

283
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,432
and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.

284
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,689
She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You'll never capture her.

285
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,736
Well, we thought you might
know someone who could help.

286
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,864
Maybe you could convince him.

in your head, all right?

306
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,482
You said, "You wanna go live

"Go ahead, Owen."

Because I left. I left you.

You left because I told you to.

312
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,913
And then, I left.

313
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,461
Because you didn't wanna live in

The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

832
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,148
is to finance our future
operations here.

and imported the best geneticists
from around the world.

839
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,507
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

an uncharted frontier.

If the entire run
of our sorry history

has taught us
one irrevocable lesson,

845
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,143
it's that man is inevitably
drawn to war

and is willing to use any
means necessary to win it.

Horses, elephants.

850

Yes, yes.

00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,159
Our geneticists have created

00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:19,162

Indominus Rex.

857
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,261
Her DNA, retrieved from the island
way before its destruction,

858
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:31,675
forms the architecture
of a completely new creature.
