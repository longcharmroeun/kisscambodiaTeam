[Please Feel at Ease Mr. Ling]

00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,210
[Episode 6]

21
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,820
Recently, it's true that some bad things have happened at Ling Group.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,070
Thank you for all your trust in me.

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,860
I will definitely take on the responsibility of the president.

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,680
Lead Ling Group to the future.

25
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,620
I do not agree!

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,370
- It's Ling Yue!
 - Yeah, it's him.

27
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,800
- It's really Ling Yue!
 - It's second brother!

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,470
Dad, he is alive.

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,370
Second brother, you're really back.

30
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,310
You scared us!

31
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,260
Father.

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,400
There's not a big problem with your leg, right?

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,670
No. The doctor said some rest will do.

34
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,140
You just said... you do not agree.

35
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,190
Exactly.

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,640
Everyone thinks it's good. Your opinion is useless.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,500
Aren't I right, little brother?

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,330
There's enough supporters of me here.

39
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,630
Your disapproval is useless. You can't take me down.

40
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,090
My little brother, broke his leg,

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,430
and even broke his head. This is laughable.

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,130
Why did you just day that you do not agree?

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,580
Because this kind of business is destined to lose money.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,840
Funds cannot be returned. Not only is it a failed plan,

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,470
in the end, it will also affect the development of the head office.

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,350
What nonsense are you talking about?

47
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,860
- You're just a—
- Let him finish talking.

48
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,410
Luocheng does look like fertile land at first glance.

49
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,270
It is located in the East Asian monsoon region

50
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,120
At its southeast corner, there's a heavy metal industrial field that's been established for decades.

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,840
Normally, there isn't anything going on.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,600
But every winter,

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,670
the factory emits large amounts of hazardous gas.

54
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,570
And due to the wind, it drifts towards Luocheng.

55
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,690
If you purchase this land, what the outcome will be,

56
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,210
I think everyone is clear about it.

57
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,110
If that's true, then wouldn't the estate rot in our hands?

58
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,840
- Yeah.
- Yes, that's right.

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,030
Ling Fang, why is it that in your plan,

60
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,880
the environmental monitoring report says that

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,990
there are no problems?

62
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,050
Don't listen to his nonsense.

63
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,530
I've checked for miles radius around. There wasn't even a factory in sight.

64
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,060
You can't have what he says goes, right?

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,390
He has no evidence. He does e-commerce, what does he know about this?

66
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,360
What a coincidence. I just happen to have evidence.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,720
Many years ago, when President Ling was looking for a location for the logistics warehouse, he considered Luocheng.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,490
This report not only shows the environmental monitoring report for miles radius, but even tens of miles.

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,620
Dad, listen to me explain.

70
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,910
Why would I listen to your explanation?

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,050
You're eager for success. Desperate for an achievement.

72
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,530
You don't even have foresight when making decisions.

73
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,320
What right do you have to be the president of the group?

74
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,110
Sorry, shareholders.

75
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,340
We took up too much of your time.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,300
Regarding the issue of Ling Fang,

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,320
becoming Ling Group's president,

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,790
- I vote against.
- What are you saying, Dad?

79
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,810
I disagree too.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,660
- Me too.
- Me too.

81
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,990
- Me too.
- I'm against.

82
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,210
- Against. 
- I'm also against.

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,350
- Me too.
- Me too.

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,420
Okay. The votes stand.

85
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,300
Meeting is over.

86
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,630
Luckily Ling Yue made it back in time. Otherwise, we wouldn't even be able to measure the losses.

87
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,160
That's right. Luckily we found out quick.

88
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,370
You did this on purpose.

89
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,200
You purposely chose this time to come back to purposely make me look bad.

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,790
- I did do this on purpose.
- Why do you have to get in my way every time?

91
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,750
Enough.

92
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,670
Do you need me to find the best doctor to take a look at your leg?

93
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,310
It's fine. I won't need it.

94
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,380
Stop being cynical.

95
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,950
Who knows what true intentions you have.

96
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,380
I believe the one having other thoughts is you, big brother.

97
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,250
I just happen to want to ask, why do you always want me to die?

98
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,460
This was found from someone else's dash cam.

99
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,230
How will you explain this?

100
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,930
- How?
- Dad, this is fake.

101
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,130
I dare you to bring the vehicle owner here.

102
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,190
Shut up.

103
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,130
Regarding this issue, Dad will give you an explanation.

104
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,720
What have you been doing all this time?

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,170
Why was there no news?

106
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,630
- I had some things to take care of.
- What,

107
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,710
is more important than the company?

108
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,100
Dad, you shouldn't worry about this.

109
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,520
Isn't the most important thing that Second Brother came back safely?

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,790
Since he's back, let's let him continue to be the pres—

111
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,410
Shut up you little brat

112
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,590
Let the spot of the president

113
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,650
be empty for now.

114
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,450
Ling Yue, take this time

115
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,420
to rest up.

116
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,250
I will do as you say.

117
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,400
Ling Fang, those old men and you are secretly

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,100
doing those small tactics behind my back.

119
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,620
Don't think I don't know.

120
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,140
So you better behave during this time.

121
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,450
You're on your own.

122
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,070
Do you think you've won?

123
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,410
It doesn't matter if you mess up my work. We're both the vice presidents right now.

124
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,120
We sit on an equal footing. Who knows about who will finally win？

125
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,040
Elder Brother, you're not my match.

126
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,580
Who are you looking down upon?

127
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,610
I don't care who the successor is.

128
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,280
I just don't want to be controlled by you.

129
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,100
So you want to control me?

130
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,410
- Elder Brother! 
 - You don't care about the position as a president?

131
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,890
- Elder Brother, we're a family. 
 - Ridiculous! Come over here!

132
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,890
There may be a misunderstanding. Calm down.

133
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,280
Calm down.

134
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,280
You brat.

135
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,090
You're amazing.

136
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,150
You're definitely going to make me be the scapegoat.

137
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,710
Elder Brother, you know if you're the scapegoat or not.

138
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,640
Let's see who's lying then.

139
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,950
Your legs are paralyzed right?

140
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,490
You really can't stand up anymore?

141
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,660
What? You don't trust me?

142
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,510
That girl is named, Gu Anxin, right?

143
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,760
Don't look at me like that.

144
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,310
Why are you suddenly interested?

145
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,630
Don't think about doing anything to Anxin.

146
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,800
You care about her?

147
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,990
- It's none of your business. 
 - How is this none of my business? Did you forget?

148
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,600
Ever since you were young, I always wanted to steal whatever you liked

149
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,080
or ruin it.

150
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,470
- You wouldn't dare to. 
 - Why wouldn't I?

151
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,820
Unless you won't ever meet her again

152
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,300
or I will definitively be able to find her.

153
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,570
Second Brother, are you fine?

154
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,420
I'm fine.

155
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,600
Ai Li, did you borrow my car last time because you knew that

156
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,960
my dashcam showed what Elder Brother and them

157
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,780
did to Second Brother's car?

158
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,980
On the day of President Ling's accident, we didn't see Director Ling Fang in the parking lot monitor.

159
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,930
But it just so happened that your car was there too.

160
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,070
So I thought it might be a lead.

161
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,280
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

162
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,120
I didn't even know my car had such a thing.

163
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,220
That was my idea. It doesn't concern you.

164
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,750
I just didn't want to drag you into this.

165
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,010
Second Brother, we're all brothers.

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,390
Elder Brother just lost himself for a moment.

167
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,550
He doesn't want to do harm to you.

168
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,570
You don't have to worry.

169
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,470
I will handle it.

170
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,700
President Ling, is your leg okay?

171
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,200
I didn't think that bastard would go so far.

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,500
Should I send you to Miss Anxin's house?

173
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,400
We can't go back there.

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,650
you just like to keep it all to yourself.

346
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,140
You're afraid of making trouble for others by telling.

347
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,860
I'm not others. I'm your brother.

348
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,820
Your brother is back. From now on, you won't ever feel wronged.

349
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,790

Alright. Don't cry. Your brother is back.

353
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,580
From now on, I won't let anyone bully you.

354
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,360
Oh, right, Brother.

355
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,540
I only asked for a half-hour off so I need to go back soon.

Okay, I'll drop you off. We have time.

No need Brother! I am very strong.

How could she not count as an outsider?

522
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,800
Dad, look,

523
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,860
I am not your biological.

524
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,310
You love me still.

525
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,990
What sort of nonsense, how could it be the same?

526
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:45,010
Yuanchao, did you finish your phone meeting?

527
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,070
It gave me a headache.

528
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,330
Let me press there.

529
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,700
You are just too tired.

530
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,560
Yuanchao, stop blaming our son.

531
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
They grew up together.

532
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,020
- Naturally, their relationship is good. 
 - That's why I'm afraid he'll be provoked by her.

533
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,290
Dad! I always feel like there's something secretive going on.

534
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,670
Anxin is so kind since little, how could she have hurt someone.

535
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,140
You think you understand her.

536
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,350
Look at her shameful behavior.

537
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,820
She is made of the same mold as her mother.

538
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,560
Whatever bad thing she does, I wouldn't be surprised.

539
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,060
That's enough, stop fighting. Our son just came back.

540
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,330
However you look at it, Anxin is a child of our Gu family.

541
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,290
You also promised Sister Jin Guan that you would take good care of her.

542
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,680
This child was indeed too headstrong in the past.

543
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,230
But I trust that she now knows she was wrong.

544
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,870
Oh right, Yuanchao.

545
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:54,090
It's your birthday in a few days. How about we welcome her over to get together?

546
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,720
You can organize it.

547
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,350
Trust me.

548
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,550
Son, eat more.

549
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,620
- Here. 
 - Thanks Mom.

♫ My heart suddenly beats abnormally ♫

556
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,620
♫ Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you ♫

557
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,140
♫ Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more ♫

558
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:56,200
♫ Abandoning the token of happiness, for it has always been you ♫

♫ Using all of my most beautiful adjectives ♫

564
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:33,090
♫ Is still not enough to describe your name ♫

565
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:39,060
♫ Our story is exclusively ours ♫

566
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,420
♫ Our palms hold onto the key to the future ♫
