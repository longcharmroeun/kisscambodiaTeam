00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,260
It's your first day at work,

683
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,420
I need to tell you the rules here.

684
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,100
Besides the daily routine

685
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,420
of new book publishing,

686
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,380
you are responsible to compile articles
for Moonlight Magazine.

687
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,330
Moonlight Magazine.

688
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,300
Have you heard of it?

689
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,500
Yes.

690
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,860
If Star Trail Magazine is
the cradle of conventional authors,

691
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,940
Moonlight Magazine is the place
for emerging writers.

692
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,180
Good.

693
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
You know your facts.

694
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,100
Get to work.

695
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,020
Chief Editor Yu.

696
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,700
Could you please approve my leave?

697
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,860
I know you are ill.

698
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,980
I have approved your previous leaves.

699
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,260
But you are asking for more,

700
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,020
I can't approve it.

701
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,980
Chief Editor Yu.

702
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,860
I want to come to work.

703
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,300
But my doctor said

704
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,980
if I don't rest well,

705
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,910
I will have all kinds of problems.

706
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,900
Could you please approve it?

707
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,700
Xian Yu.

708
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,860
Don't always make it hard
for Chief Editor Yu.

709
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,790
She can't approve it.

710
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,380
Your problem

711
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,380
has already spread to next door.

712
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,460
They say

713
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,900
you are well protected.

714
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,740
You are always on leave and yet

715
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,030
you can still keep your job.

716
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:01,980
That's weird.

717
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,340
When I am on leave,

718
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,750
my work isn't affected.

719
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,460
Who is the busybody

720
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,420
interfering with our department's affair?

721
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,590
Have some respect for Chief Editor Yu.

722
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,790
Haven't I told you?

723
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,100
Chief Editor Yu is not the highest
authority in the editorial department.

724
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,140
Mr Xia is in charge of the
first and second sections.

725
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm sorry.

726
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,860
I'm late with your coffee.

727
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,710
Chief Editor Yu.

728
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,350
Thanks.

729
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,980
Sis Xian Xian.

730
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,990
You are here.

731
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,940
I think I missed out on one.

732
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,020
You can have mine.

733
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,780
Thanks.

734
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,100
Chief Editor Yu.

735
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,180
Without sugar?

736
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,670
No sugar.

737
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,670
Thank you.

738
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,430
Are you the new intern Chu Li?

739
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,460
I'm Du Niao Niao.

740
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,700
You can call me Xiao Niao.

741
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,740
I have one too?

742
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Of course.

743
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,860
We are colleagues.

744
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,710
You're welcome.

745
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,060
Thanks, Chief Editor Yu.

746
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,380
Chu Li.

747
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,420
Well,

748
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,180
today

749
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,620
is Yuan Yue Publishing House's open day.

750
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,310
Go to the first floor to welcome

751
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,580
our guest authors.

752
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,220
Can you handle the job?

753
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,300
Yes, I can.

754
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,470
Right.

755
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,710
Come with me, Xiao Niao.

756
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,420
Okay.

757
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,780
Please put these on my desk.

758
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,630
Thanks.

759
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,780
Chief Editor.

760
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,820
Deputy Editor.

761
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,940
Who will come

762
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,460
to the open day?

763
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,780
You don't need to worry about

764
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,980
the open day.

765
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,949
Those who can really write

766
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,659
will submit their writings online.

767
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,909
It's hard to say who will come today.

768
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,739
Hi.

769
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm the intern editor of Yuan Yue.

770
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,580
I'm Chu Li.

771
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,630
Are you here to submit your writing?

772
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,980
Let me tell you.

773
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,940
This novel

774
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,310
will win at least three major awards
for Yuan Yue Publishing House.

775
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,260
Besides the Nobel Prize in Literature,

776
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,980
Nobel Prize in Chemistry,

777
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,469
Noble Prize in Physics

778
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,179
will make an exception for it.

779
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,139
Little boy.

780
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,660
There's a typo error

781
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,860
in this sentence.

782
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,030
Grandma.

783
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,230
This is a book on Huangmei opera.

784
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,460
Perhaps you want to try
the opera publishing house?

785
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,420
The intern in the opera publishing house

786
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,150
asked me to come here.

787
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,910
Perhaps

788
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,030
I can sing for you?

789
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,750
Later,

790
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,990
I'll take you to meet

791
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,020
some authors who often work with us.

792
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,150
That will be useful.

793
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,910
No wonder my uncle says

794
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,670
you are the kindest chief editor.

795
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,940
Deputy editor.

796
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,950
Mr He Ma is one of the most

797
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,980
promising authors

798
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,540
contesting in the Huazhi Award.

799
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,950
However,

800
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,270
about the copyright

801
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,940
for his new books,

802
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,620
could you please talk to him?

803
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,580
Of course.

804
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,550
You can rest assured.

805
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,550
My uncle said

806
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,900
as long as you're in Yuan Yue,

807
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,150
you will be the editor of his books.

808
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,620
I can promise him

809
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,300
as long as you are with Yuan Yue,

810
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,700
I'll make sure you are

811
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,350
happy and comfortable.

812
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,870
Thank you.

813
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,020
You are welcome.

814
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,380
Who are these people?

815
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:23,400
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

816
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,220
[First day at work and]

817
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,350
[I have seen the
bottomless Mariana Trench]

818
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,590
[between reality and dreams.]

819
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,020
[Undercurrent running
below a calm surface.]

820
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,220
Grandpa.

821
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,660
It's working hours.

822
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,590
You can do the cleaning in the afternoon.

823
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,940
Do I look like a cleaner?

824
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,430
Aren't you here to mop the floor?

825
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,510
Unless you are here for a Quidditch match?

826
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,950
Yes.

827
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,180
I am cleaning.

828
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,940
I am old.

829
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,060
I'll clean anything

830
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,470
that looks dirty.

831
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,260
Thank you.

832
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,830
It's not dirty.

833
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,860
It isn't very dirty.

834
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,980
Just like Mum.

835
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,500
They have sharp eyes.

836
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,820
Are you a staff here?

837
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,310
I have never seen you before.

838
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,030
I am the new intern editor.

839
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,540
I am Chu Li.

840
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,070
Nice to meet you.

841
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,390
Are you a fan of Moonlight Magazine?

842
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,630
That's on the first page
of the inaugural issue.

843
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,110
My grandfather gave me that name.

844
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,110
Mr Xia.

845
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,350
You are back early.

846
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,190
Mr Xia?

847
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,870
You are the editor-in-chief.

848
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,980
Miao.

849
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,670
I heard you have contacted Zhou Chuan?

850
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,950
It's like this, Mr Xia.

851
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,190
Zhou Chuan has published only one book,

852
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,030
Oriental Beauty.

853
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,870
Compared to Kou Wei

854
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,700
there's a huge gap.

855
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,990
I've read Zhou Chuan's novel.

856
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,390
I think he's good.

857
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,630
Apart from him,

858
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,670
are there any other candidates?

859
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,260
I want to recommend

860
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,220
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng.

861
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,750
Who?

862
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,910
Jiang Yu Cheng.

863
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,180
Chu Li.

864
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,260
I remember you have a degree in finance.

865
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,790
Jiang Yu Cheng

866
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,190
is showing an obvious downward trend.

867
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,830
Does he have potential?

868
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,470
How did you get your degree in finance?

869
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,670
That's true.

870
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,310
Since he and Gu Bai Zhi

871
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,900
stopped working together,

872
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,030
he failed twice consecutively.

873
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,870
Failing twice is not a major issue.

874
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,310
Failing twice isn't a major issue?

875
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,790
This will affect

876
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,470
our jobs

877
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,310
in the editorial department.

878
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,470
Do you think it's a game?

879
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,110
That you have a few chances?

880
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,150
Do you think you can wake up

881
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,020
the sleeping Jiang Yu Cheng?

882
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,780
Are you better than Gu Bai Zhi?

883
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,030
Yuan Yue Publishing House

884
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,590
made Jiang Yu Cheng famous.

885
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,580
Anyone can let him go.

886
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,710
But I think

887
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,150
Yuan Yue should give him another chance.

888
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,910
Xiao Niao.

889
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,270
Chu Li.

890
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,150
Come over.

891
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,150
You heard

892
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,310
what Mr Xia said.

893
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,100
Whoever signs him first

894
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,740
and gets a good result

895
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,790
will be hired permanently.

896
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,750
I am willing to represent Yuan Yue

897
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,630
and talk to Mr Jiang.

898
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,190
I am his fan for many years.

899
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,390
My success rate may be higher.

900
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,030
I'll follow your order.

with Jiang Yu Cheng.]

[Corner Bookstore]

Welcome.

904
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,190
Looking for a book?

905
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,550
Yes, I'm looking for Oriental Beauty.

906
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,910
It's here.

907
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,470
Are you ready? Let's go.

908
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,150
Let me pack up.

909
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,150
By the way.

910
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,100
My fan

911
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,150
is buying your book.

912
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,550
It's her.

913
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,990
She returns to the right path?

914
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,430
Hold it.

915
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,110
I thought you said it's
good for nothing two days ago.

916
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,070
How come you want to buy it today?

917
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,710
I didn't say it's not good.

918
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,510
I'm not going to take the blame.

919
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,110
Do you like both books

920
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,830

Do you like both of them?

Who likes them?

924
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,260
Check your eyes if you have bad eyesight.

925
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,750
That's a personal attack.

926
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,910
Did I offend you?

927
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,070
Do I know you?

928
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,790
Am I close to you?

929
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,670
Don't assume I'm

930

This is a classic of all classics.

937
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,590
Why did you put them far apart?

938
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,910
It's only right to put

939
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,070
their books side by side.

940

Anybody can come in.

It's quite a good book.
