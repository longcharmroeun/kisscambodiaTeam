00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,860
<i>Shi’s Mansion</i>

37
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,060
Grandfather!

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,860
Jin.

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,540
It concerns the Shi family’s reputation.

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,460
There is no place for you to speak.

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,460
There must be some misunderstanding.

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,260
Just ask Shi Feixian to come out

43
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
and we will know
if there is any misunderstanding.

44
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,500
Your Shi family
had the balls to do it,

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,180
why are you afraid to admit it?

46
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,060
Princess Ban,

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,420
you’re used to
running wild in the capital.

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,900
It seems like no one
can control you now.

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,860
You broke into my mansion today

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,740
and want to arraign my granddaughter.

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,980
Who gives you the power?

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
<i>Court of Judicial Review</i>

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,380
<i>Court of Judicial Review</i>
Princess Ban has no right to arraign her.

54
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,340
<i>Court of Judicial Review</i>
What about Court of Judicial Review?

55
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,540
Mr. Shi.

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,900
The Court of Judicial Review

57
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,860
has the sole right for investigation.

58
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,980
Please assist with my work

59
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,380
and let Miss Shi out for questions.

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,300
You took soldiers here

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,300
for the case or to humiliate me?

62
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,700
It’s an emergency.

63
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,180
Please pardon me.

64
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,780
Today Duke Ban was attacked.

65
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,340
The assassin said he’s hired
by Miss Shi,

66
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,780
and gave me this as evidence.

67
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,860
If Miss Shi can prove that

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
she didn’t lose
the two pearls she bought,

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,340
her name will be cleared.

70
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,500
Ridiculous!

71
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,220
Mr. Shi, it’s His Majesty’s order.

72
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,620
Please don’t make it hard for me.

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,740
It’s my daughter’s room.

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,980
How can you search it at will?

75
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
Just one question to her.

76
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,540
Why are you stopping us?

77
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,820
Princess Ban.

78
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,540
The search of her room by the Court

79
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,100
will impair her reputation.

80
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
As a girl,

81
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,460
you surely know the importance of it.

82
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Do you mean

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
your sister’s reputation

84
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,660
is more important than my father’s life?

85
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,980
I...

86
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,380
You are so aggressive.

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,380
If Her Grace is wronged,

88
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,460
what are you gonna do?

89
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
If I get her wronged,

90
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,100
I’ll apologize to everyone.

91
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,900
If I’m right,

92
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,460
I’ll put all of you into prison!

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,140
Count Cheng’an,
your wife is unreasonable

94
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,140
and you are no better than her.

95
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,860
You are really a disgrace

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,820
to all the scholars.

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,260
Why do you say so, Mr. Shi?

98
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,420
Filial piety is also
the way of scholars.

99
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,020
No more arguing.

100
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,420
Your Grace.

101
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
That pearl is indeed the one I lost,

102
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,060
but I’ve never hired any assassin.

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,580
Do you believe me?

104
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,940
Whether you’re innocent or not,

105
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,220
the court will investigate it.

106
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,100
I don’t have the say.

107
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,220
You... You really want me
to go to the Court?

108
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,740
The truth is to be found out.

109
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,380
Please assist us with it.

110
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
Tomorrow morning,

111
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,020
I will go to the court.

112
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,900
Your Majesty!

113
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,940
Your Majesty!

114
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,860
Your Majesty!

115
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,820
Your Majesty!

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,940
I cannot be the Prime Minister!

117
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,300
Your Majesty!

118
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,980
Come on.

119
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,820
Rise, please.

120
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,580
Tell me.

121
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,460
How did you get hurt so badly?

122
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,060
Your Majesty.

123
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,940
I just became the Prime Minister,

124
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,780
and an assassin was hired
to hurt my head!

125
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,820
I’ll get killed if it goes on like this!

126
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,820
Ridiculous!

127
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,300
Someone dared to

128
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,660
assassinate you under my nose!

129
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,180
Where is Liu Banshan,
the Minister of Judicial Review?

130
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,740
Go! Summon him to me!

131
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,700
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

132
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,060
I have an idea.

133
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,420
Why don’t you let Count Xie
be Prime Minister?

134
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,220
I’ll be safe when he is attacked.

135
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,260
Count Xie?

136
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,820
Yes.

137
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,220
Won’t you vie with him?

138
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,820
No, not anymore. Your Majesty.

139
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,580
My life matters more, Your Majesty!

140
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,300
My aunt was gone not long ago

141
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,580
before such things happened.

142
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,540
Rest assured.

143
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,300
I’ll order the court to find it out

144
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,380
and uphold justice for you.

145
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

146
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,380
Alright. Alright.

147
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,180
Duke Jingting. You may go back and rest.

148
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,100
Yes. Thank you, Your Majesty.

149
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

150
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:22,860
<i>Insightful and Honest</i>

151
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,620
Why is she peeking at you?

152
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,380
Is she?

153
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,660
I only have you in my eyes.

154
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,740
I didn’t pay attention to her.

155
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,500
Who are you?

156
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,660
Mr. Liu, yesterday,

157
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,580
you went to my mansion to question me.

158
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,420
Don’t you know who I am?

159
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
Miss. Shi.

160
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,420
Do you know what I’m going to ask

161
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,460
about the case?

162
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,180
I do.

163
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,940
Is the pearl yours, Miss Shi?

164
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,340
Yes, it’s mine.

165
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,100
I lost it days ago.

166
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,460
Lost? Where did you lose it?

167
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,860
Your Grace.

168
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,900
Do you want me

169
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,860
to tell it here?

170
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,020
Just tell the truth, Miss Shi.

171
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,180
It was a pearl embroidered on my shoes.

172
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,820
The other day, I went to the west grove

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,380
and lost it there.

174
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,900
You seldom go out of your mansion.

175
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Why did you go there?

176
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,540
For an appointment, of course.

177
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,020
Appointment? Who did you meet?

178
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,940
The culprit, certainly.

179
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah.

180
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Miss Shi.

181
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,060
Any witness for your statement?

182
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,980
This is the invitation letter,

183
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
a material evidence.

184
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,220
The letter was written
by Count Cheng’an.

185
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,460
Count Cheng’an?

186
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,900
Did Count Cheng’an meet her?

187
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,780
What was it?

188
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,100
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

189
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,900
You may leave me alone.

190
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,100
Yes.

191
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,120
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

192
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,740
Wait! Miss Shi.

193
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,860
You said he invited you by the letter,

194
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,260
yet he didn’t go there.

195
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,380
Why didn’t you go?

196
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,900
Hua, it’s not written by me.

197
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,980
Why should I go there?

198
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,820
You mean,

199
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,700
you would go if it’s written by you?

200
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,900
I... But...

201
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,170
I...

202
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,460
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

203
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,020
Miss Shi, one more question.

204
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,380
There’s no signature on the letter.

205
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,660
Why are you so sure

206
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,860
it’s written by Count Cheng’an?

207
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,220
Because... Because...

208
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,220
Because I collect many

209
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,380
calligraphy and paintings of his,

210
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,780
and study them every day.

211
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,380
I’m not sure of others’ handwriting,

212
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,900
but I can surely

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,420
recognize his.

214
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,860
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

215
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,380
It is your handwriting!

216
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,020
Hua, you don’t know about calligraphy.

217
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,980
Don’t jump to the conclusion.

218
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,780
Mr. Liu. You are a famous calligrapher.

219
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,500
Can you make a judgement?

220
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,460
Your Grace, I’ve checked it carefully.

221
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,860
It is yours.

222
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,060
Impossible!

223
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,700
Your Grace.

224
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,060
You do have feelings for me,

225
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,180
but you don’t dare to make it public.

226
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,020
As a woman, I’ve confessed it.

227
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,980
Are you still hiding it?

228
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,300
Listen to her.

229
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,540
Let’s see what happened.

230
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,540
Hua, you must trust me.

231
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,020
It has nothing to do with me.

232
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,380
There’s no way I could do that!

233
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,660
Count Cheng’an, you deceived my sister.

234
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,780
Now, you are lying to Her Grace

235
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
in public!

236
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,380
Shut up!

237
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,260
Your Grace.

238
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,980
I will not allow him to be close to you.

239
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,900
I mean you shut up.

240
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,180
It’s between Count Cheng’an and me.

241
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,060
I don’t want anyone else to step in.

242
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,020
I’ve eaten out.

243
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,780
Give me another pack. Come on.

244
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,500
Silence!

245
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,620
The case will be retried later.

246
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,700
Guards.

247
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,340
Aye.

248
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Take Shi Feixian to the back hall.

249
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,220
Aye.

250
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,060
Wait.

251
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,780
Mr. Liu.

252
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,580
The case has nothing to do
with my sister.

253
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,260
Why don’t you release her?

254
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Calm down, Mr. Shi.

255
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,500
His Majesty ordered me to look into it.

256
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,740
All people concerned will be detained.

257
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,180
Your sister...

258
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,620
Count Cheng’an, you’ll be detained, too.

259
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,820
Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu.

260
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,700
News updated!

261
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,340
Count Cheng’an loves Miss Shi for long.

262
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,900
The engagement
with Princess Ban is fake.

263
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,060
Cut it out. Your news is out of date.

264
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,020
I’ve long heard that

265
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,180
Count Cheng’an loves Miss Shi,

266
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,020
but her brother disagrees.

267
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,260
Is it also true that
Mr. Shi loves Princess Ban?

268
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,340
<i>Melon</i>

269
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,260
<i>Melon</i>
Of course.

270
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,180
So, you know,

271
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,900
Count Cheng’an doesn’t love
Princess Ban.

272
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,100
He... He flirted her

273
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,380
just to irrigate Mr. Shi Jin.

274
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,540
I’m completely confused.

275
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,900
Who loves whom then?

276
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,300
<i>Melon</i>
I got it.

277
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,780
Count Cheng’an loves Mr. Shi Jin.

278
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,420
Shut up!

279
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,660
Your Highness! Your Highness!

280
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,500
Get out of my way!

281
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,700
Your Highness, I know you are anxious.

282
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,580
But she’s in the Court
of Judicial Review.

283
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,700
How will you save her?

284
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,020
I’ll beg my father and mother for it.

285
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,220
Or I will go to the Ban family

286
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,580
and let Duke Jingting drop the charge.

287
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,900
Given your relationship
with Princess Ban,

288
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,220
I don’t think it will work.

289
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,980
Then I’ll tear down the Court.

290
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,060
I won’t allow my sister to suffer.

291
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,100
Your recklessness

292
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,580
will get His Majesty suspicious of you!

293
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,780
What should I do then?

294
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,940
You proposed the plan.

295
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,660
Now you are stopping me.

296
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,500
Ban Huai didn’t die,
while Feixian got in trouble.

297
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,940
If anything happens to her,

298
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,980
you’ll be punished!

299
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,940
To save Miss Shi,

300
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,220
you can’t make it this way.

301
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,540
Do you have an idea?

302
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,580
Darn it, Count Cheng’an!

303
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,260
You broke into my mansion
behind His Majesty’s back!

304
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,460
He delivered a fake edict.

305
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,860
Sir, only a report to His Majesty

306
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,100
can get him killed.

307
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,660
No.

308
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,740
Feixian is still a suspect.

309
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,180
A reckless report

310
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,340
will get us stuck in trouble.

311
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,300
It’s complicated and confusing.

312
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,900
Rong Xia got himself in custody.

313
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,140
Is it his plot?

314
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,060
It occurred right after Qizhou’s issue.

315
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,300
I can’t make out

316
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,100
the inner connection either.

317
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,540
Always assume the worst.

318
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,020
Sir, you mean...

319
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,980
Tell our allies in the court
not to take action.

320
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,660
The letter written in blood

321
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,420
shall not be obtained by the Ban family.

322
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,060
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

323
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,940
What are you apologizing for?

324
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,900
Your Grace.

325
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,220
Did you really have feelings
for Feixian?

326
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,740
Don’t mistake it, Hua.

327
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,460
I apologized

328
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,300
for getting both of us in it

329
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,780
and making it a farce.

330
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,260
I’m sorry for getting you upset.

331
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,860
I trust you, certainly.

332
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,780
It’s unexpected in the law court.

333
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,540
I just lost my head.

334
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Do you mean it?

335
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,500
Um.

336
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,340
Then why did you...

337
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,500
Stop... Stop it.

338
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,700
I came to tell you something.

339
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,780
I thought a lot after I went back.

340
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,380
And I suppose

341
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,540
something is fishy.

342
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,780
I don’t think

343
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,900
Shi Feixian is the culprit.

344
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,220
You’re right. Look.

345
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,860
If she is the culprit,

346
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,220
why did she try
to assassinate my father?

347
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,780
I should’ve been her target.

348
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I agree with you.

349
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,100
The assassin hirer and the letter forger

350
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,620
could be accomplices,

351
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
or the same person.

352
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,420
The purpose

353
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,780
was to sow discord between us,

354
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,740
and the Shi family.

355
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,260
We got tricked. What to do?

356
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,020
We can do nothing

357
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,500
until they give the game away.

358
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,380
Now I am not by your side.

359
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,540
The top priority

360
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,540
is to protect yourself

361
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,900
and your father.

362
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,380
Without chicken, I’ll make do with duck.

363
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,180
Speak. What do you want?

364
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,900
I’m caring about your father

365
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,980
out of kindness.

366
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,740
Xie Wanyu.

367
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,540
We’ve been friends for long.

368
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,820
Stop being so defensive.

369
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,740
Don’t you feel bad?

370
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,100
I’ll cut to the chase then.

371
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Truth to be told,

372
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,500
I’m here

373
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,660
to plead for Miss Feixian.

374
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,500
That wasn’t her doing.

375
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,900
Your sister wronged her.

376
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,660
I’ve never seen anyone

377
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,620
so silly as you.

378
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,700
What’s the relationship

379
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,380
between Jiang Luo and her?

380
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,340
Have you forgotten it?

381
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,580
And you even plead for her.

382
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,540
Don’t talk nonsense.

383
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,420
It’s not like that.

384
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,500
I’ve figured it out.

385
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,340
Husband is nothing but an identity.

386
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,340
But Feixian

387
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,860
is my best friend.

388
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,420
I cannot stand by.

389
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,740
Marriage is predestined.

390
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,540
Both of you are around her.

391
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,940
What... What do you mean?

392
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,580
Forget it.

393
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,180
Why give me the head?

394
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,180
You need some brains.

395
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,180
You...!

396
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Guess who I am?

397
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,700
Jiang Luo, stop it.

398
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,660
Have a seat, please.

399
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,460
Your Highness.

400
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,460
We were intimate in childhood.

401
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,180
Why are we estranged now?

402
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,140
Luo. What brings you here?

403
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,820
Do you mean

404
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,940
you don’t want to see me?

405
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,580
No, I mean,

406
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,220
I didn’t expect

407
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,820
someday

408
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,660
you and I

409
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,500
could be so intimate again.

410
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,060
I’m overjoyed.

411
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,540
Alright. What you said

412
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,380
is really touching.

413
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,340
I’m greatly blessed

414
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,540
to be your brother.

415
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,180
Jiang Luo.

416
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,420
Do you feel unwell?

417
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,020
Do you need to see the physician?

418
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
No, no need.

419
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,180
I heard you suffered a disaster.

420
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,740
I was anxious, so I came.

421
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,980
Disaster?

422
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
Don’t you know it?

423
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,580
In the capital, it’s rumored that

424
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,140
the Crown Princess’s family

425
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,540
plotted to kill Duke Jingting.

426
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,300
Shi Feixian has been imprisoned.

427
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,020
Jiang Luo. You must hear it wrong.

428
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,100
She just went for some questions,

429
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,980
not being convicted.

430
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,700
Zhang, the Shi family is high-ranking.

431
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,460
And you are their son-in-law.

432
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,020
How come you don’t worry at all?

433
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,020
It’s not my business.

434
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,620
Why should I?

435
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,180
Zhang.

436
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,060
If your wife is too worried about it,

437
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,860
it will influence

438
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,020
your relationship with her.

439
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,180
That’s why I come to remind you.

440
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,660
Thanks for reminding me timely.

441
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,620
Or else, I couldn’t have thought of it.

442
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,220
But... What... What am I to do?

443
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,260
Let me think.

444
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,060
How about a gift to them?

445
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,940
Go to console Duke Jingting?

446
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,300
I... I’ll see to it now.

449
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,700
What’s going on?

450
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,140
Didn’t they know I’d come today?

451
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,460
Your Highness.

452
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,060
The notice and gifts were delivered
this morning.

453
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,460
But they said...

454
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,220
What did they say?

455
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,940
They said they didn’t deserve them

456
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,620
and wouldn’t accept them.

457
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,580
The case concerned the Shi family.

458
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,020
Crown Prince and you
shouldn’t intervene.

459
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,140
Ridiculous.

460
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,620
Ban Hua broke into Shi’s mansion.

461
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,500
I didn’t hold her accountable,

462
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,460
yet they dare to refuse to see me.

463
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,460
Calm down, Your Highness.

464
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,980
Never mind.

465
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,500
Get the gifts off the carriage.

466
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,220
Now that I’ve come,

467
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,020
they must accept it

468
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,580
whether they want it or not.

469
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,140
Your Grace! Madam! Bad news!

470
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,940
Crown Princess is breaking in
with others!

471
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,220
She comes for Shi Feixian, I guess.

472
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,100
I’m going to stop her.

473
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,740
Let her in.

474
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,020
I’m gonna see

475
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,220
what the Shi family is up to.

476
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,020
Crown Princess has arrived!

477
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,820
Come and welcome Her Highness!

478
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,900
No bother.

479
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,180
Since Princess Ban is
Crown Prince’s cousin,

480
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,420
that makes her my cousin.

481
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,780
No etiquette for families.

482
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,580
Your Highness comes.

483
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,260
It’s our great honor.

484
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,540
I’m here to apologize for my sister.

485
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,740
Do you admit she’s guilty?

486
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,580
She incurred the rumor and
hurt Count Cheng’an and you.

487
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,700
She is indeed guilty.

488
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,980
I got you some gifts.

489
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,740
Please accept them.

490
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,380
I cannot accept them.

491
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,260
What?

492
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,900
Did the rumor

493
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,180
estrange you from Count Cheng’an?

494
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,140
A rumor

495
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,060
doesn’t bother me at all.

496
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,100
There is more than one thing

497
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,620
that your family should apologize for.

498
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,660
My father got attacked for no reason.

499
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,700
I couldn’t just accept them.

500
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,060
How dare you

501
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,460
be so rude to Her Highness?

502
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,340
How dare you

503
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,420
disrespect Her Grace?

504
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,940
You...!

505
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,100
The Court will definitely find out

506
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,780
the assassin hirer.

507
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,700
These gifts are not from the Shi family.

508
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,420
They are from Crown Prince.

509
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,300
You really got me puzzled.

510
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,380
Since they’re from Crown Prince,

511
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,180
why are you bringing Shi family up?

512
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,580
Better make friends than make enemies.

513
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,100
Princess Royal is gone.

514
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,100
The relationship
between our two families

515
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,780
relies on us to maintain.

516
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,020
Don’t forget it, Princess Ban.

517
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,020
Daye is no longer

518
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,460
what it used to be.

519
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,420
You are not here to deliver gifts,

520
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,380
but to push us
to drop the charge, right?

521
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,820
I will cut to the chase.

522
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,460
Before my father’s attacker
is found out,

523
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,580
you can do nothing,

524
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,820
neither Crown Prince

525
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,300
nor Prime Minister Shi himself.

526
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,300
How bold!

527
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,260
How dare you talk to me like this!

528
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,100
Kneel!

529
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,420
You want me to kneel?

530
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,620
I’m the Crown Princess.

531
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,460
My name is in the royal ancestral book.

532
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Why can’t you kneel to me?

533
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,980
It’s you

534
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,860
who shall kneel to my grandmother,

535
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,180
Princess Royal Dening

536
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,220
of Daye.

537
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,020
You...!

538
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,980
Hurry and go back to your mansion.

539
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,700
Don’t throw your weight around here.

540
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,300
This is the exquisite kettle of Ru Ware,

541
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,820
one and the only.

542
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,940
Your Highness! Is my dignity

543
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,980
less important than a kettle?

544
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,500
Suyue. You’re more important, of course.

545
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,460
But

546
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,740
it’s no use smashing it.

547
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,820
If you really value me more,

548
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,020
how can you stand that I’m humiliated?

549
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,100
If it’s known by people,

550
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,380
it would be a great shame to me.

551
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,380
Suyue.

552
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,940
Ban Hua is actually nice.

553
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,980
Alright. Stop crying.

554
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,300
I promise whatever you want.

555
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,380
How is it?

556
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,820
Report it to His Majesty and punish her.

557
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,380
Well...

558
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,740
We’re families.

559
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,100
That’s not good, is it?

560
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,660
Harmony matters the most.

561
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,620
All things prosper in harmony.

562
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,380
Your Highness, you are so weak.

563
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,100
Even the Ban family

564
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,940
shows no respect to us.

565
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,940
How will you be the leader of ministers?

566
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,900
It’s not that serious.

567
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,540
It is!

568
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,980
The Ban family tries to bring us down

569
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,180
over and over again.

570
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,460
Who knows what they are up to?

571
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,740
Your Highness, if my family falls,

572
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,540
who else can help you ascend the throne?

573
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,940
Without my family,

574
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,300
you’ll lose the kingdom.

575
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,780
Watch your tongue, Suyue.

576
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,180
Did she really say so?

577
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

578
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,100
She said the exact words.

579
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,900
Absurd!

580
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,740
Without the Shi family,
Crown Prince couldn’t be enthroned?

581
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,220
Crown Prince is conferred by me.

582
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,700
What is it to do with Shi Chonghai?

583
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,500
Calm down, Your Majesty.

584
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,780
Crown Princess must’ve
had a slip of her tongue.

585
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,940
Your Majesty, please don’t...

586
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,340
A woman

587
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,820
dares to intervene the state affairs.

588
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,540
How can she

589
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,980
be the queen of the state in the future?

590
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Your Majesty, are you going to...

591
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,940
Father, are you busy?

592
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,420
I have something to talk to you.

593
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,180
Come in.

594
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,860
Father, you are occupied.

595
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,100
Thanks for meeting me.

596
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,260
I appreciate it.

597
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,260
What’s the matter?

598
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,020
I wonder

599
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,220
if the Court of Judicial Review

600
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,940
can release Shi Feixian.

601
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,700
I... I’m just asking.

602
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,540
It’s fine if you disagree.

603
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,780
You good-for-nothing!

604
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,460
How come I have a son like you!

605
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,260
You are the Crown Prince of the state

606
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,860
before you are
the Shi family’s son-in-law.

607
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,940
Calm down! Father!

608
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,500
I... I didn’t mean that.

609
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,140
How should I calm down?

610
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,420
The only son of your great-aunt

611
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,620
got attacked!

612
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,660
You don’t go after the assassin,

613
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,060
yet you come to plead
for the Shi family?

614
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,140
Father! Father!

615
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,740
I... I’m wrong.

616
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,780
Don’t be mad, Father

617
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,380
Not mad,

618
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,500
I’m just sad.

619
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,340
Even Crown Princess
can order you around.

620
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,780
You’re timid and cowardly,

621
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,460
yet I’ll have to hand over the kingdom

622
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,700
to you.

623
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,820
-Your Majesty!
-Father!

624
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,660
Your Majesty!

625
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,820
-Your Majesty!
-Father! Father!

626
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,420
Imperial physician!

627
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,300
Father, are you alright?

628
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,100
Your Majesty.

629
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,220
How is His Majesty?

630
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,380
Your Highness.

631
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,100
His Majesty suffers poor blood flow
due to overwork.

632
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,340
He could have a stroke.

633
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,820
Stroke?

634
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,300
Please tell me.

635
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,740
How to treat this disease?

636
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,140
I’ll prescribe medicines to
pacify his mind.

637
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,660
His Majesty needs more rest.

638
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Don’t anger him once again.

639
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
I understand.

640
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,140
Physician Chen. Keep it a secret.

641
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,780
Do not leak it out.

642
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,540
Mother, it’s my fault.

643
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,620
Hadn’t I got him mad, Father wouldn’t...

644
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,460
Keep your voice down, Zhang.

645
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,820
Let your father have a good rest.

646
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,900
The storm is coming.

647
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,620
We all need to prepare for it.

648
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,740
Miss Feixian.

649
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,700
Are you alright?

650
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

651
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,380
What brings you here?

652
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,780
Feixian, I went to beg the Ban family

653
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,700
to release you.

654
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,020
But they refused.

655
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,540
I’m so useless.

656
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,020
Watching you suffer here,

657
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,660
I cannot do anything to help.

658
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,380
I’m really pleased

659
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,740
for your kindness.

660
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,580
Also, for others,

661
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,820
it’s a place of pain.

662
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,940
But not for me.

663
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,220
What do you mean?

664
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,700
Since I came to the Court,

665
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,660
I’ve burned my bridges.

666
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,460
Whatever the cost is,

667
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,380
I’ll be with Count Cheng’an.

668
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,180
Although it’s a prison,

669
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,980
for me,

670
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,020
it’s the nearest place
to Count Cheng’an.

671
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,700
Seeing the same moon with him,

672
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,780
and having the same food,

673
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
I don’t feel pain

674
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,820
at all.

675
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,900
Feixian, even now,

676
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,180
you still think

677
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,620
the letter was written
by Count Cheng’an?

678
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,660
I’m sure

679
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,500
that is his handwriting.

680
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,140
Come on. Let’s drink.

681
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,220
Come on, drink.

682
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,700
Let’s play a game.

683
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,140
Finger-guessing, alright?

684
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,220
Come on.

685
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,620
-Six!
-Two!

686
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,580
You lose! Drink!

687
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,740
Come on. Go on.

688
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,100
-Three.
-Eight.

689
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,460
-Six.
-Two.

690
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,540
-Six.
-Eight.

691
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,740
-Eight.
-Two.

692
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,300
-Five.
-Six.

693
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,820
-Three.
-Six.

694
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,140
Young Master, looks like

695
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,980
the prison is more comfortable
than home.

696
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,620
Ban Hua arranged this for me.

697
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,140
I told her it’s unnecessary.

698
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,900
She said I was not used to a prison,

699
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,980
and insisted on it.

700
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,300
I come here today

701
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
to tell you something.

702
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,300
You asked me to

703
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,500
keep an eye on that assassin.

704
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,060
Last night, some skilled masters

705
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,100
really came to the prison.

706
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,700
I talked with them

707
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,660
and then tailed them.

708
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,340
Take a guess. Who ordered them to come?

709
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,460
Xie Chongjin.

710
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,580
Do you know it?

711
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,460
Why did you ask me
to keep an eye on it then?

712
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,140
A letter was forged by my handwriting.

713
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,900
Then Shi Feixian was asked out
for an appointment.

714
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,020
The assassin attacked Prime Minister

715
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,340
and deliberately left clues

716
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,380
so that Hua broke into Shi’s mansion.

717
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,260
It’s meticulously planned.

718
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,100
Other than Xie Chongjin,

719
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,220
no one else can do that in Daye.

720
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,940
Young Master Xie

721
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,340
made so many efforts to do these.

722
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,020
What’s his purpose?

723
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,820
To kill someone with others’ hand
is his usual trick.

724
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,580
Kill the target with no blood shedding

725
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,300
and get away with it.

726
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,500
Du Jiu.

727
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,740
Who is guarding

728
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,820
the assassin’s cell?

729
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,740
Our men have all been withdrawn.

730
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,420
Only the guards from the Court,
I suppose.

731
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,300
Go ahead! He’s in danger!

732
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,140
Why did you frame my sister?

733
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,940
I didn’t.

734
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,340
No way could she hire an assassin.

735
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,860
The only possibility is
that you are lying.

736
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,380
You tailed her to the Red Earth Temple,

737
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,460
stole her pearl,

738
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,020
and pinned the assassination on her.

739
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,180
Believe it or not,

740
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,420
it’s Shi Feixian

741
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,900
who gave me the pearl
and ordered the assassination.

742
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,940
Who ordered you?

743
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,540
You sow the discord between
the Shi family and Ban family.

744
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,020
What’s your motive?

745
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,340
Your sister committed the crime,

746
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,940
and you want me to be the scapegoat.

747
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,380
I won’t!

748
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,100
Shi Feixian is the culprit!

749
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,700
You won’t kill me, will you?

750
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,540
You think I dare not kill you?

751
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,780
Go ahead. Kill me,

752
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,980
and your sister will not leave alive.

753
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,540
<i>Court of Judicial Review</i>

754
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,160
Mr. Liu.

755
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,500
Citronella fragrance
is in the letter paper,

756
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,540
which is only sold in one shop
in capital.

757
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,100
I’ve brought the shop owner to you.

758
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,860
Ask him yourself, please.

759
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,060
Is the paper from your shop?

760
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,740
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

761
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,700
Sir, the paper is indeed from my shop.

762
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,660
But Count Cheng’an

763
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,740
has never bought things in my shop.

764
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,700
Sir, please release Count Cheng’an.

765
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,500
Calm down, Your Grace.

766
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,340
The paper can rule out his suspicion,

767
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,900
but it can’t show the real culprit.

768
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,140
Other than the paper, there is ink.

769
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,940
The culprit focused on the handwriting,

770
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,780
but he missed the details.

771
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,580
It’s not difficult
to find out the culprit.

772
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,460
It’s intelligent of you. Thanks.

773
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,660
I’ll look into it right now.

774
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,940
It’s just that

775
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,780
to clear Miss Shi’s name,

776
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,300
more direct evidences are needed.

777
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,340
I understand. I’ll figure a way out.

778
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,740
Sir! Bad news!

779
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,740
Mr. Shi Jin got into the prison angrily!

780
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,940
He is killing him!

781
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,060
What?

782
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,180
Mr. Shi.

783
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,620
Mr. Shi, chill out.

784
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,020
His Majesty ordered
to find out the truth.

785
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,100
Please don’t kill him.

786
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,300
My master said

787
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,660
the assassin is the key to the case.

788
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,100
He can’t get hurt or starved.

789
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,140
Please wait a moment

790
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
if you mean to interrogate him.

791
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,420
Is that the food for prisoners?

792
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,300
Does my sister also eat this?

793
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,260
She’s a prisoner, too.

794
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,580
It’s already good for her to have food.

795
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,260
Shut up!

796
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,500
It’s you!

797
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,980
Mr. Shi killed the assassin!

798
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,020
Mr. Shi,
you’re eager to save your sister,

799
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,020
but don’t hurt the innocent.

800
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,540
You’ve killed a man.

801
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,780
Don’t do it again.

802
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,740
You mistook it.

803
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,620
He’s killed by that guard!

804
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,900
Your Grace! Seize him!

805
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,340
He’s the culprit!

806
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,100
How is he?

807
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,980
He’s dead.

808
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,540
Who could be so vicious

809
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,940
to use poison?

810
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,020
Fude House.

811
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,140
Fude House?

812
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,860
Yes.

813
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,420
Fude House is
the top organization of assassins.

814
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,660
It cost a big price to hire them.

815
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,260
Was my father’s attacker

816
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,460
also from Fude House?

817
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,380
It doesn’t make sense.

818
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,300
Xie Chongjin is an ordinary official.

819
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,140
How could he have connections
with assassins?

820
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,100
Whatever he’s up to,

821
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,180
just capture and interrogate him.

822
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,340
Don’t be reckless, Hua.

823
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,340
Xie Chongjin is crafty.

824
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,700
It’s not so simple as it seems.

825
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,780
We should wait.

826
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,860
The assassin has been silenced.
Wait for what?

827
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,420
As long as

828
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,900
we make public Chongjin’s dirty deeds,

829
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,740
everything will be clear.

830
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,860
But he’s backed up by Prince Luo.

831
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,380
Shi Feixian is backed up
by Crown Prince.

832
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,580
Rest assured, Your Grace.

833
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,540
I know what to do.

834
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,540
I’ll take him by surprise.
