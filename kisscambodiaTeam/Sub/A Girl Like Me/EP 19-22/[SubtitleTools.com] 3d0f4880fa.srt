5

What contract?

6
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,990
I thought you've signed and
sealed the contract.

7
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,190
I didn't say that.

8

9

13
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,150
You want me to look for the seal

14
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,100
or to clean up your room?

15
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,950
To look for the seal, of course.

16
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,790
But you have to clean up to find it.

17

No...

176

She had to rush back to office
after meeting me

177
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,270
but she can slack off for Jiang Yu Cheng?

What is this?

179
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,950
Why is it him?

180
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,780
Hello?

181
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,470
Come to my house now!

182
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,420
If not, I won't sign the contract!

183
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,820
What's going on?

184
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,100
It's broken?

185
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,550
Yes.

186
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,670
You called me here for a broken
washing machine?

187
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,190
Can't you ask for a technician?

188
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,110
I'm in a rush.

189
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,750
Mr Zhou Chuan.

190
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,430
Don't you know

191
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,350
how to check the power source?

192
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,870
I don't know.

193
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,150
I have a nanny to settle it for me.

194
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,590
This is common sense!

195
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,710
Why are you shouting?

196
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,110
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,220
I have to leave for my errands.

198
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,710
Wait.

199
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,230
Now that you're here,

200
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,550
you can continue cleaning up

201
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,510
the remaining mess.

202
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,390
Since that you have a lot of free time.

203
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,070
I'm not! I'm really busy!

204
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,430
I've only slept for three hours
from yesterday.

205
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,270
I was tidying up the shelves yesterday,

206
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,510
but you tricked me here

207
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,510
and made me late.

208
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,190
Ms Yu scolded me so badly.

209
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,910
I was thinking to work hard today,

210
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,750
but something happened to Mr Miao.

211
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,110
I had to rush my way to send him a laptop.

212
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,470
I was able to get some rest

213
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,750
and take a peek at my idol.

214
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,420
But I'm here for a washing machine!

215
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,550
A washing machine!

216
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,030
You must use electric for it!

217
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,790
Don't you know?

218
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,590
You...

219
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,430
Are you thirsty?

220
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,460
Do you want a drink?

221
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,990
I'm not thirsty.

222
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,230
Mr Zhou Chuan.

223
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,830
I was in a wrong mood.

224
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,550
I'm not saying that I'm not cleaning up.

225
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,550
I'm just too tired to do it.

226

227
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,340
I'll clean up your house tomorrow.

228
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,710
See you tomorrow!

229
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,270

273

From the moment I read you book titled

274
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,830
The Disappearing Zoo,

275
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,700
I made a goal for myself.

276
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,460
If I have the chance,

277
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,590
I'll definitely film this into a movie.

278
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,710
Didn't I obtain the chance now?

279
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,350
Actually, plenty of people had

280
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,580
reached out to Mr Jiang

281
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,110
for his book's copyright.

282
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,430
He didn't say yes to anyone.

283
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,710
But he said yes

284
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,150
when he heard it was you.

285
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,870
Mr Jiang is your fan.

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,820
Which films do you like?

287
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,670
Besides Yesterday,

288
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,430
I like No Man's Land and Straw.

289

These are my earliest works.

290
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,790

That's a must!

300
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,990
I remember I told you

301
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,150
that I'm not selling it.

302
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,990
You're too late.

303
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,630
From the moment you accepted
the invitation,

304
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,750

I admire his work.

307

But that doesn't mean
I admire his personality

308
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,670
or that I'll work with him.

If you offend him,

312
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,630
no one will dare to film your work
into movies.

313
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,390
Do you believe it or not?

314
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,869
What are you trying to do?

315
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,830
What am I trying to do?

316
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,030
I'm pulling you away
from the rusty publishing house.

317

I'm helping you to start anew.

318
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,190
You were the one
who made me into such a mess.

319
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,750
Don't you feel guilty to speak with me

320
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,070
in such a rightful manner?

321
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,750

322

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,310
You.

326
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,630
Me?

327
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,620
I was busy with Yuan Yue Publishing House

328
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,030
that I didn't make time for you.

329
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,260
What's wrong?

330
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,150
You're joining Yuan Yue Publishing House?

331
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,670

332
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,540
Hello, Mr Jiang.

333
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,390
I'm Miao.

334
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,740
I'm calling

335
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,430
to ask about

336
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,190
the contract with us.

337
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,230
What are your thoughts?

338
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,220
After your presentation,

339
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,270
I pondered for a while.

340
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,350
[I think we're not on the same path.]

341
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,230
I think we can wait for

342
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,670
another chance to work together.

343
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,750
I'll hang up as I'm occupied.

344
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,670
Hello? Hello? Hello?

345
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,510
What is it?

346
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,950
Jiang Yu Cheng refused to work with us.

347
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,990
Why?

348
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,510
You refused?

349
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,630
Why?

350
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,830
The deputy editor and editor
tried to brainwash me

351
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,550
into writing fantasy and
immortal cultivation.

352
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,430
Miao is capable to do this.

353
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,340
He thinks about the market
and the top hits,

354
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,990
but not the authors.

355
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,030
Miao.

356
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,860
Is Jiang Yu Cheng's Weibo

357
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,750
related to your meeting with
him yesterday?

358
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,750
I know.

359
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,390
The readers were saying that his new work

360
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,670
is controversial.

361
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,950
He was unhappy?

362
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,350
I reminded you.

363
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,230
Famous young authors like Jiang Yu Cheng

364
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,790
are difficult to handle.

365
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,630
Do you think the arrogance of a author

366
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,670
only appears in fictional works?

367
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,150
It was all my fault.

368
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,830
I followed the PowerPoint presentation

369
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,110
and spoke directly.

370
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,270
You didn't make the slides?

371
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,870
Not entirely.

372
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,830
Not entirely?

373
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,470
Chu Li.

374
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,190
Did you work on the slides?

375
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,030
It's not entirely Chu Li's fault.

376
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,630
I thought Chu Li will understand
Jiang Yu Cheng better

377
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,950
as she is his loyal reader.

378
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,630
So I asked her to amend it for me.

379
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,630
But I never thought...

380
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,710
Yes.

381
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,110
But I don't think Mr Jiang

382
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,590
is such a narrow-minded man.

383
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,910
He'll never get mad with
such trivial matters.

384
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,510
Do you think you know Jiang Yu Cheng?

385
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,430
This is great.

386
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,830
You failed to sign Zhou Chuan,

387
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,950
and Xiao Niao failed to

388
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,590
get Jiang Yu Cheng because of you!

389
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,310
No.

390
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,910
How can you put the blame on me?

391
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,670
I admit that I made the slides.

392
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,390
But you agreed to the content

393
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,830
and went with the meeting.

394
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,100
Why...

395
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,350
Stop fighting!

396
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,430
Think of a way to

397
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,470
salvage this.

398
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,870
All of you are really

399
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,710
unprofessional beyond my expectation.

400
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,430
We'll look at the contracts.

401
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,350
If you can't get it,

402
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,630
none of you will stay.

403
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,470
I have an old reader

404
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,630
working at Yuan Yue.

405
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,990
I thought she'll come

406
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,100
when I saw the slides.

407
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,630
What old reader?

408
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,310
She's at Yuan Yue?

409
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,150
What's her name?

410
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,630
I didn't hear about her from you.

411
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,510
When did you feel interested

412
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,190
at my reader?

413
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,870
Who's interested in her?

414
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,150
I have higher quality readers than you.

415
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,910
Who would care about your readers?

416
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,230
Ugly and ill-tempered.

417
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,350
What a joke.

418
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,790
Hello, Mr Xia.

419
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,390
How many times did I tell you?

420
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,390
An author must have passion

421
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,620
for his work.

422
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,700
Hence, a masterpiece will be made.

423
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,550
As editors,

424
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,710
we must never try

425
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,430
to control them.

426
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,390
No.

427
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,030
Mr Xia, I...

428
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,270
I'm not controlling him.

429
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,710
You're not controlling Jiang Yu Cheng
by asking him to write

430
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,990
about fantasy and immortal cultivation?

431
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,470
Fantasy and immortal cultivation?

432
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,150
Mr Jiang's expertise is suspense
and thriller.

433
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,670
Miao.

434
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,990
You didn't tell me about asking

435
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,950
Jiang Yu Cheng to switch genres.

436
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,670
The reason I did it

437
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,590
is because...

438
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,110
I hope that Mr Jiang can have
a change in his preference.

439
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,830
After all,

440
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,020
fantasy and cultivation

441
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,950
is the most popular genre in the market.

442
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,830
I did it for his own good.

443
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,350
Have you considered about

444
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,390
his feelings?

445
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,790
Will he like it?

446
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,310
This time,

447
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,430
if I didn't

448
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,980
contact Jiang Yu Cheng on my own,

449
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,990
I'll still be in the dark until now.

450
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,950
I'm reminding all of you.

451
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,630
As an editor,

452
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,430
we must respect the authors.

453
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,750
I don't wish to see this

454
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,300
happen again.

455
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,550
Understand?

456
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,390
Yes.

457
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,030
Xiang, thank you

458
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,470
for tidying up the place with me.

459
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,950
You're welcome.

460
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,670
I wish everyone in the office

461
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,350
can be as kind as you.

462
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm not expecting them to be so kind.

463
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,470
But they should at least be fair.

464
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,550
They shouldn't push the blame on me.

465
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,710
Chu Li.

466
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,980
I think you should keep a low profile
from now on.

467
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,910
If you offend Deputy Editor,

468
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,940
you'll have a hard time.

469
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,550
Someone has his back.

470
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,670
Who?

471
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,630
Have some sweets.

472
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,230
No, I don't.

473
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,670
Take it.

474
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,630
No, I have glycosuria.

475
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,510
Eat it yourself.

476
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,870
Mr Liang?

477
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,100
Rumours said

478
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,230
that Mr Xia is retiring.

479
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,470
The position of the Vice President

480
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,830
will be chosen between Mr Liang and Ms Yu.

481
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,150
But Mr Yang had already decided

482
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,070
to put Mr Liang on the seat.

483
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,390
Didn't you see?

484
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,830
Mr Liang is beginning

485
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,150
to take over other departments.

486
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,190
[Zui Qian Yu Winehouse]

487
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,070
Miao.

488
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,430
How many years have we met?

489
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,750
It's been five years.

490
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,870
Five years.

491
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,990
Where were you five years before?

492
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,390
I was at the circulation department
as a promoter.

493
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,590
I ran around in various bookstores
regardless of the weather.

494
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,270
Bookstores back then had a hard time.

495
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,030
Unlike the modern ones now

496
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,790
that sells creative works and coffee.

497
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,830
Every day when the sun comes up,

498
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,710
those old trademarks

499
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,070
would fall like dominos.

500
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,630
Mr Liang.

501
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,820
This is actually my greatest concern.

502
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,020
I'm worried that

503
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,390
Yuan Yue Publishing House
will share the same fate

504
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,430
if we don't change our module.

505
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,820
Yuan Yue Publishing House is not stubborn,

506
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,340
but the manager of
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

507
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,510
You know the person I'm directing at.

508
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,710
I knew right away without
your hint, Mr Liang.

509
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,030
That's right.

510
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,310
Yuan Yue Publishing House had promoted

511
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,270
some famous authors.

512
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,630
But look at where we are.

513
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,910
We're getting beaten by

514
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,470
huge companies like Xin Dun Books.

515
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,470
And we don't stand a chance.

516
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,580
This is the market discipline.

517
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,710
Passion? Who doesn't have passion?

518
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,660
Yuan Yue Publishing House will be gone.

519
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,390
Where will the passion be?

520
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,390
Right?

521
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,430
They're making a fuss over nothing.

522
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,910
They're acting coy.

523
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,870
I won't joke with you.

524
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,270
Here's an inside news.

525
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,670
Mr Yang gave his word.

526
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,110
When Mr Xia retires,

527
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,300
Yuan Yue Publishing House
will be under my command.

528
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,030
You mean...

529
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,820
Don't you understand?

530
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,630
Don't act silly here.

531
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,030
Miao.

532
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,790
I know about your personality.

533
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,830
And I know about your capability.

534
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,590
So from now on,

535
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,390
the editorial department depends on you.

536
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,780
Guard it well.

537
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,510
You'll be my right-hand man in the future.

538
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,230
Understand?

539
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,630
Yes! I'll give you a toast.

540
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,590
Stop it.

541
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,590
Here's another inside scope.

542
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,390
Sure.

543
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,830
Yue Dong Games is interested
to obtain the animation

544
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,950
and gaming copyright of

545
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,990
the Oriental Beauty.

546
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,910
Their boss loves the book.

547
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,910
Mr Zhang from Yue Dong?

548
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,390
He's the pioneer of the gaming industry.

549
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,550
You know Mr Zhang's ability.

550
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,190
Everything that he has his eyes
on will be popular.

551
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,710
Zhou Chuan will be extremely valuable.

552
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,580
Place the rest of authors aside.

553
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,150
Do you best to get Zhou Chuan

554
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,350
into our company, understand?

555
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,740
You must take him down personally.

556
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,870
Understand?

557
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,190
Chu Li.

558
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,340
Give me a copy of Zhou Chuan's contract.

559
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,630
Mr Zhou Chuan's contract is with him.

560
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,830
He said he'll give it to me
after he seals it.

561
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,430
Fine, then print me another copy.

562
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,190
Deputy Editor.

563
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,270
May I know why do you need the contract?

564
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,310
From today onwards,

565
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,830
Zhou Chuan is off your hands.

566
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,950
I'll take over.

567
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,630
Off my hands?

568
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,670
Why?

569
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,460
Don't ask why.

570
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,950
Never mind.

571
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,430
I'll do it myself.

572
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,950
If he's taking me away from
Zhou Chuan's case,

573
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,270
does he want me to leave
the publishing house?

574
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,030
Chu Li.

575
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,670
How about this?

576
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,630
Call Mr Zhou Chuan

577
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,630
in front of Deputy Editor Miao

578
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,550
to confirm his decision.

579
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,030
[Sorry, the number you have dialled...]

580
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,550
Xiang, I'm going to Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

581
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,820
What's that face?

582
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,910
Mr Zhou.

583
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,110
I didn't see you for a day.

584
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,190
You've exerted yourself
like this for work?

585
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,310
Did your flu get worse?

586
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,790
What do you think?

587
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,910
The thing is, Mr Zhou Chuan...

588
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,750
I have an presumptuous request.

589
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,580
Can you please...

590
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,430
Drink hot water if you caught a cold!

591
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,750
How are you?

592
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,070
I'm fine.

593
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,110
I'll help you.

594
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,990
Careful.

595
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,550
Do you have a thermometer?

596
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,110
I don't know.

597
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,590
Leave if there's no urgency.

598
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,790
Don't disturb me.

599
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,870
Xiao Niao.

600
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,220
Where is she?

601
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,270
She went to Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

602
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,910
No, that's because...

603
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,430
No?

604
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,950
Do you have to cover up for her?

605
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,950
Didn't I tell her

606
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,420
that I'll be in charge of Zhou Chuan?

607
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,950
Is she really a dimwit?

608
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,990
It's related to the internship result.

609
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,700
It's common for her to be nervous.

610
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,270
Why didn't you leave?

611
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,950
No! I want to sleep!

612
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,790
Place the thermometer under the tongue.

613
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,660
Thirty eight degrees?

614
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,430
Have some porridge and flu medicine.

615
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,670
You must visit the hospital

616
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,390
if you feel unwell tomorrow, okay?

617
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,190
There's no meat.

618
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,110
How unpalatable.

619
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,790
There's meat below.

620
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,790
I made this beef porridge for you.

621
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,670
You made it?

622
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,470
Then?

623
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,270
Did I procure it with magic?

624
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,430
I have no strength to drink it.

625
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,990
Brother.

626
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,390
Do you want me to feed you?

627
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,590
It's fine.

628
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,060
I can fall sick until I die.

629
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,710
Didn't I ask you to leave?

630
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,940
Am I such a person who will abandon

631
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,260
a sick and lonely man behind?

632
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,430
Don't you hate me?

633
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,070
You're overthinking.

634
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,150
How would I hate you?

635
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,430
I can't wait to hold you like
a treasure in my hands.

636
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,390
I'm not eating.

637
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,830
You have to eat!

638
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,790
I don't eat food from people I dislike.

639
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,110
Who told you that I hate you?

640
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,030
No one told me.

641
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,270
I can see it myself.

642
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,430
You even threw tantrums.

643
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,710
It's just a temporary
mental breakdown from adults.

644
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,310
Fine.

645
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,550
I did hate you before.

646
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,870
But I don't hate you anymore.

647
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,670
Why?

648
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,700
That's because you're
eating the porridge obediently.

649
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,750
Drink this.

650
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,110
Mr Zhou Chuan.

651
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,670
Can you please help me tomorrow...

652
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:29,110
How great it'll be
if you're this obedient.

653
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,190
Come in.

654
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,989
Chief Editor.

655
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,310
Chu Li can't do this.

656
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,270
How did she offend you again?

657
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,190
She didn't offend me.

658
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,750
I think her capability

659
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,420
and working attitude are problematic.

660
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,949
Look.

661
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,380
She always leave the office

662
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,469
without a reason.

663
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,550
Then,

664
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,150
she'll try to defy her leaders.

665
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,030
She didn't contribute
to the publishing house at all.

666
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,420
I think

667
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,110
she's not suitable to work here.

668
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:04,190
You mean...

669
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,550
I mean

670
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,340
we should end her probation early.

671
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,740
That's going against the regulations.

672
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,430
There's no regulations about it.

673
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,140
Look, Chief Editor.

674
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,350
The current situation of

675
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,670
our office is obvious.

676
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,100
We can't afford to employ useless people.

677
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,670
You gave her time

678
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,990
to sign Zhou Chuan with us.

679
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,110
But I think

680
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,750
she'll never get it done

681
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,430
no matter how much time you give her.

682
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,550
If that's so,

683
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,420
I'd rather we place our concentration

684

Even though she didn't get to
sign Jiang Yu Cheng,

686
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,460
but

687
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,340
Mr He Ma had signed under us.

688

through our publishing house.

690
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,350
She had already exceeded our expectations.

stay or departure

in our meeting today.

705

The both of them weren't allowed to stay

706
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,310
because they failed their tasks.

707
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,590
But Xiao Niao

708
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,590
was able to contact Mr He Ma

709
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,190
and obtained his copyrights

710
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,350
for the next five years.

711
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,590
So, Xiao Niao gets to stay.

lost his seal for the contract?

Isn't there plenty of authors
who behaved like him?

Therefore, Chu Li.

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,830
Will Zhou Chuan seal

00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,860
Get Uncle Zhou some fish.

853
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,270
I'm not used to serve food to others.

854
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,110
Others? Who's the others?

855
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,510
I'm your father!

856
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,660
When did you ever carry out
your duty as a father?

857
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,910
Look at him! Look at him!

858
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,790
He's already so arrogant now that

859
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,710
he accomplished nothing!

860
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,830
Old Zhou.

861
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,110
Your words might be too harsh.

862
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,300
From what I know,

863
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,380
Little Zhou's works are being prepared

864
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,070
for animation and gaming production.

865
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,900
Am I right?

866
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,830
Yes.

867
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,300
The aesthetics nowadays
are really crooked.

868
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,350
Those who are on trend

869
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,550
can be developed even
if they're at the tertiary level.

870
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,470
I think you're jealous of me.

871
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,790
Just by your level of expertise,

872
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,270
are you worthy of my jealousy?

873
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,670
I want to see

874
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,110
after a decade

875
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,150
if anyone will be interested
in your works.

876
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,070
I'm done eating.

877
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,110
Stop right there!

878
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,550
Zhou Chuan!

879
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,190
Old Zhou! Look at your fiery temper!

880
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,700
The lights are still on.

881
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,510
Where is he?

882
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,270
Behind you.
