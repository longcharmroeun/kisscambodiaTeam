What contract?

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,990
I thought you've signed and
sealed the contract.

7
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,190
I didn't say that.

9

13
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,150
You want me to look for the seal

14
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,100
or to clean up your room?

15
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,950
To look for the seal, of course.

16
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,790
But you have to clean up to find it.

17

No...

She had to rush back to office
after meeting me

177
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,270
but she can slack off for Jiang Yu Cheng?

What is this?

179
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,950
Why is it him?

180
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,780
Hello?

181
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,470
Come to my house now!

182
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,420
If not, I won't sign the contract!

183
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,820
What's going on?

184
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,100
It's broken?

185
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,550
Yes.

186
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,670
You called me here for a broken
washing machine?

187
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,190
Can't you ask for a technician?

188
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,110
I'm in a rush.

189
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,750
Mr Zhou Chuan.

190
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,430
Don't you know

191
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,350
how to check the power source?

192
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,870
I don't know.

193
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,150
I have a nanny to settle it for me.

194
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,590
This is common sense!

195
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,710
Why are you shouting?

196
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,220
I have to leave for my errands.

198
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,710
Wait.

199
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,230
Now that you're here,

200
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,550
you can continue cleaning up

201
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,510
the remaining mess.

202
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,390
Since that you have a lot of free time.

203
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,070
I'm not! I'm really busy!

204
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,430
I've only slept for three hours
from yesterday.

205
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,270
I was tidying up the shelves yesterday,

206
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,510
but you tricked me here

207
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,510
and made me late.

208
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,190
Ms Yu scolded me so badly.

209
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,910
I was thinking to work hard today,

210
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,750
but something happened to Mr Miao.

211
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,110
I had to rush my way to send him a laptop.

212
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,470
I was able to get some rest

213
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,750
and take a peek at my idol.

214
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,420
But I'm here for a washing machine!

215
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,550
A washing machine!

216
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,030
You must use electric for it!

217
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,790
Don't you know?

218
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,590
You...

219
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,430
Are you thirsty?

220
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,460
Do you want a drink?

221
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,990
I'm not thirsty.

222
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,230
Mr Zhou Chuan.

223
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,830
I was in a wrong mood.

224
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm not saying that I'm not cleaning up.

225
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,550
I'm just too tired to do it.

227
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,340
I'll clean up your house tomorrow.

228
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,710
See you tomorrow!

229

From the moment I read you book titled

274
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,830
The Disappearing Zoo,

275
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,700
I made a goal for myself.

276
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,460
If I have the chance,

277
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,590
I'll definitely film this into a movie.

278
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,710
Didn't I obtain the chance now?

279
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,350
Actually, plenty of people had

280
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,580
reached out to Mr Jiang

281
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,110
for his book's copyright.

282
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,430
He didn't say yes to anyone.

283
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,710
But he said yes

284
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,150
when he heard it was you.

285
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,870

Which films do you like?

287
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,670
Besides Yesterday,

288
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,430
I like No Man's Land and Straw.

289

These are my earliest works.

290
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,790

That's a must!

300
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,990
I remember I told you

301
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,150
that I'm not selling it.

302
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,990
You're too late.

303
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,630
From the moment you accepted
the invitation,

304
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,750

I admire his work.

307

But that doesn't mean
I admire his personality

308

or that I'll work with him.

If you offend him,

312
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,630
no one will dare to film your work
into movies.

313
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,390
Do you believe it or not?

314
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,869
What are you trying to do?

315
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,830
What am I trying to do?

316

from the rusty publishing house.

318
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,190
You were the one
who made me into such a mess.

319
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,750
Don't you feel guilty to speak with me

320
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,070
in such a rightful manner?

321
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,750

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,310
You.

326
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,630
Me?

327
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,620
I was busy with Yuan Yue Publishing House

328
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,030
that I didn't make time for you.

329
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,260
What's wrong?

330
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,150
You're joining Yuan Yue Publishing House?

331
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,670

332
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,540
Hello, Mr Jiang.

I'm Miao.

334
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm calling

335
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,430
to ask about

336
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,190
the contract with us.

337
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,230
What are your thoughts?

338
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,220
After your presentation,

339
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,270
I pondered for a while.

340
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,350
[I think we're not on the same path.]

341
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,230
I think we can wait for

342
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,670
another chance to work together.

343
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,750
I'll hang up as I'm occupied.

344
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,670
Hello? Hello? Hello?

345
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,510
What is it?

346
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,950
Jiang Yu Cheng refused to work with us.

347
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,990
Why?

348
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,510
You refused?

349
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,630
Why?

350
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,830
The deputy editor and editor
tried to brainwash me

351
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,550
into writing fantasy and
immortal cultivation.

352
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,430
Miao is capable to do this.

353
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,340
He thinks about the market
and the top hits,

354
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,990
but not the authors.

355
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,030
Miao.

356
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,860
Is Jiang Yu Cheng's Weibo

357
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,750
related to your meeting with
him yesterday?

358
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,750
I know.

359
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,390
The readers were saying that his new work

360
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,670
is controversial.

361
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,950
He was unhappy?

362
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,350
I reminded you.

363
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,230
Famous young authors like Jiang Yu Cheng

364
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,790
are difficult to handle.

365
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,630
Do you think the arrogance of a author

366
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,670
only appears in fictional works?

367
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,150
It was all my fault.

368
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,830
I followed the PowerPoint presentation

369
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,110
and spoke directly.

370
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,270
You didn't make the slides?

371
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,870
Not entirely.

372
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,830
Not entirely?

373
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,470
Chu Li.

374
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,190
Did you work on the slides?

375
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,030
It's not entirely Chu Li's fault.

376
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,630
I thought Chu Li will understand
Jiang Yu Cheng better

377
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,950
as she is his loyal reader.

378
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,630
So I asked her to amend it for me.

379
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,630
But I never thought...

380
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,710
Yes.

381
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,110
But I don't think Mr Jiang

382
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,590
is such a narrow-minded man.

383
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,910
He'll never get mad with
such trivial matters.

384
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,510
Do you think you know Jiang Yu Cheng?

385
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,430
This is great.

386
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,830
You failed to sign Zhou Chuan,

387
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,950
and Xiao Niao failed to

388
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,590
get Jiang Yu Cheng because of you!

389
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,310
No.

390
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,910
How can you put the blame on me?

391
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,670
I admit that I made the slides.

392
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,390
But you agreed to the content

393
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,830
and went with the meeting.

394
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,100
Why...

395
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,350
Stop fighting!

396
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,430
Think of a way to

397
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,470
salvage this.

398
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,870
All of you are really

399
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,710
unprofessional beyond my expectation.

400
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,430
We'll look at the contracts.

401
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,350
If you can't get it,

402
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,630
none of you will stay.

403
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,470
I have an old reader

404
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,630
working at Yuan Yue.

405
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,990
I thought she'll come

406
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,100
when I saw the slides.

407
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,630
What old reader?

408
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,310
She's at Yuan Yue?

409
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,150
What's her name?

410
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,630
I didn't hear about her from you.

411
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,510
When did you feel interested

412
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,190
at my reader?

413
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,870
Who's interested in her?

414
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,150
I have higher quality readers than you.

415
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,910
Who would care about your readers?

416
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,230
Ugly and ill-tempered.

417
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,350
What a joke.

418
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,790
Hello, Mr Xia.

419
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,390
How many times did I tell you?

420
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,390
An author must have passion

421
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,620
for his work.

422
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,700
Hence, a masterpiece will be made.

423
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,550
As editors,

424
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,710
we must never try

425
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,430
to control them.

426
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,390
No.

427
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,030
Mr Xia, I...

428
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,270
I'm not controlling him.

429
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,710
You're not controlling Jiang Yu Cheng
by asking him to write

430
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,990
about fantasy and immortal cultivation?

431
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,470
Fantasy and immortal cultivation?

432
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,150
Mr Jiang's expertise is suspense
and thriller.

433
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,670
Miao.

434
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,990
You didn't tell me about asking

435
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,950
Jiang Yu Cheng to switch genres.

436
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,670
The reason I did it

437
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,590
is because...

438
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,110
I hope that Mr Jiang can have
a change in his preference.

439
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,830
After all,

440
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,020
fantasy and cultivation

441
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,950
is the most popular genre in the market.

442
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,830
I did it for his own good.

443
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,350
Have you considered about

444
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,390
his feelings?

445
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,790
Will he like it?

446
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,310
This time,

447
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,430
if I didn't

448
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,980
contact Jiang Yu Cheng on my own,

449
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,990
I'll still be in the dark until now.

450
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,950
I'm reminding all of you.

451
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,630
As an editor,

452
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,430
we must respect the authors.

453
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,750
I don't wish to see this

454
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,300
happen again.

455
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,550
Understand?

456
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,390
Yes.

457
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,030
Xiang, thank you

458
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,470
for tidying up the place with me.

459
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,950
You're welcome.

460
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,670
I wish everyone in the office

461
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,350
can be as kind as you.

462
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,180
I'm not expecting them to be so kind.

463
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,470
But they should at least be fair.

464
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,550
They shouldn't push the blame on me.

465
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,710
Chu Li.

466
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,980
I think you should keep a low profile
from now on.

467
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,910
If you offend Deputy Editor,

468
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,940
you'll have a hard time.

469
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,550
Someone has his back.

470
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,670
Who?

471
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,630
Have some sweets.

472
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,230
No, I don't.

473
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,670
Take it.

474
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,630
No, I have glycosuria.

475
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,510
Eat it yourself.

476
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,870
Mr Liang?

477
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,100
Rumours said

478
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,230
that Mr Xia is retiring.

479
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,470
The position of the Vice President

480
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,830
will be chosen between Mr Liang and Ms Yu.

481
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,150
But Mr Yang had already decided

482
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,070
to put Mr Liang on the seat.

483
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,390
Didn't you see?

484
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,830
Mr Liang is beginning

485
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,150
to take over other departments.

486
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,190
[Zui Qian Yu Winehouse]

487
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,070
Miao.

488
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,430
How many years have we met?

489
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,750
It's been five years.

490
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,870
Five years.

491
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,990
Where were you five years before?

492
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,390
I was at the circulation department
as a promoter.

493
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,590
I ran around in various bookstores
regardless of the weather.

494
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,270
Bookstores back then had a hard time.

495
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,030
Unlike the modern ones now

496
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,790
that sells creative works and coffee.

497
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,830
Every day when the sun comes up,

498
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,710
those old trademarks

499
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,070
would fall like dominos.

500
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,630
Mr Liang.

501
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,820
This is actually my greatest concern.

502
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,020
I'm worried that

503
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,390
Yuan Yue Publishing House
will share the same fate

504
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,430
if we don't change our module.

505
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,820
Yuan Yue Publishing House is not stubborn,

506
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,340
but the manager of
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

507
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,510
You know the person I'm directing at.

508
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,710
I knew right away without
your hint, Mr Liang.

509
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,030
That's right.

510
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,310
Yuan Yue Publishing House had promoted

511
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,270
some famous authors.

512
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,630
But look at where we are.

513
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,910
We're getting beaten by

514
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,470
huge companies like Xin Dun Books.

515
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,470
And we don't stand a chance.

516
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,580
This is the market discipline.

517
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,710
Passion? Who doesn't have passion?

518
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,660
Yuan Yue Publishing House will be gone.

519
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,390
Where will the passion be?

520
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,390
Right?

521
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,430
They're making a fuss over nothing.

522
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,910
They're acting coy.

523
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,870
I won't joke with you.

524
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,270
Here's an inside news.

525
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,670
Mr Yang gave his word.

526
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,110
When Mr Xia retires,

527
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,300
Yuan Yue Publishing House
will be under my command.

528
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,030
You mean...

529
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,820
Don't you understand?

530
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,630
Don't act silly here.

531
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,030
Miao.

532
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,790
I know about your personality.

533
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,830
And I know about your capability.

534
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,590
So from now on,

535
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,390
the editorial department depends on you.

536
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,780
Guard it well.

537
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,510
You'll be my right-hand man in the future.

538
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,230
Understand?

539
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,630
Yes! I'll give you a toast.

540
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,590
Stop it.

541
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,590
Here's another inside scope.

542
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,390
Sure.

543
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,830
Yue Dong Games is interested
to obtain the animation

544
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,950
and gaming copyright of

545
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,990
the Oriental Beauty.

546
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,910
Their boss loves the book.

547
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,910
Mr Zhang from Yue Dong?

548
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,390
He's the pioneer of the gaming industry.

549
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,550
You know Mr Zhang's ability.

550
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,190
Everything that he has his eyes
on will be popular.

551
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,710
Zhou Chuan will be extremely valuable.

552
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,580
Place the rest of authors aside.

553
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,150
Do you best to get Zhou Chuan

554
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,350
into our company, understand?

555
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,740
You must take him down personally.

556
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,870
Understand?

557
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,190
Chu Li.

558
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,340
Give me a copy of Zhou Chuan's contract.

559
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,630
Mr Zhou Chuan's contract is with him.

560
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,830
He said he'll give it to me
after he seals it.

561
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,430
Fine, then print me another copy.

562
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,190
Deputy Editor.

563
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,270
May I know why do you need the contract?

564
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,310
From today onwards,

565
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,830
Zhou Chuan is off your hands.

566
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,950
I'll take over.

567
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,630
Off my hands?

568
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,670
Why?

569
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,460
Don't ask why.

570
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,950
Never mind.

571
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,430
I'll do it myself.

572
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,950
If he's taking me away from
Zhou Chuan's case,

573
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,270
does he want me to leave
the publishing house?

574
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,030
Chu Li.

575
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,670
How about this?

576
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,630
Call Mr Zhou Chuan

577
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,630
in front of Deputy Editor Miao

578
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,550
to confirm his decision.

579
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,030
[Sorry, the number you have dialled...]

580
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,550
Xiang, I'm going to Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

581
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,820
What's that face?

582
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,910
Mr Zhou.

583
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,110
I didn't see you for a day.

584
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,190
You've exerted yourself
like this for work?

585
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,310
Did your flu get worse?

586
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,790
What do you think?

587
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,910
The thing is, Mr Zhou Chuan...

588
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,750
I have an presumptuous request.

589
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,580
Can you please...

590
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,430
Drink hot water if you caught a cold!

591
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,750
How are you?

592
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm fine.

593
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,110
I'll help you.

594
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,990
Careful.

595
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,550
Do you have a thermometer?

596
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,110
I don't know.

597
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,590
Leave if there's no urgency.

598
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,790
Don't disturb me.

599
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,870
Xiao Niao.

600
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,220
Where is she?

601
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,270
She went to Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

602
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,910
No, that's because...

603
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,430
No?

604
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,950
Do you have to cover up for her?

605
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,950
Didn't I tell her

606
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,420
that I'll be in charge of Zhou Chuan?

607
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,950
Is she really a dimwit?

608
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,990
It's related to the internship result.

609
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,700
It's common for her to be nervous.

610
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,270
Why didn't you leave?

611
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,950
No! I want to sleep!

612
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,790
Place the thermometer under the tongue.

613
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,660
Thirty eight degrees?

614
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,430
Have some porridge and flu medicine.

615
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,670
You must visit the hospital

616
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,390
if you feel unwell tomorrow, okay?

617
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,190
There's no meat.

618
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,110
How unpalatable.

619
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,790
There's meat below.

620
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,790
I made this beef porridge for you.

621
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,670
You made it?

622
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,470
Then?

623
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,270
Did I procure it with magic?

624
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,430
I have no strength to drink it.

625
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,990
Brother.

626
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,390
Do you want me to feed you?

627
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,590
It's fine.

628
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,060
I can fall sick until I die.

629
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,710
Didn't I ask you to leave?

630
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,940
Am I such a person who will abandon

631
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,260
a sick and lonely man behind?

632
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,430
Don't you hate me?

633
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,070
You're overthinking.

634
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,150
How would I hate you?

635
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,430
I can't wait to hold you like
a treasure in my hands.

636
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,390
I'm not eating.

637
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,830
You have to eat!

638
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,790
I don't eat food from people I dislike.

639
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,110
Who told you that I hate you?

640
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,030
No one told me.

641
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,270
I can see it myself.

642
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,430
You even threw tantrums.

643
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,710
It's just a temporary
mental breakdown from adults.

644
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,310
Fine.

645
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,550
I did hate you before.

646
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,870
But I don't hate you anymore.

647
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,670
Why?

648
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,700
That's because you're
eating the porridge obediently.

649
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,750
Drink this.

650
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,110
Mr Zhou Chuan.

651
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,670
Can you please help me tomorrow...

652
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,110
How great it'll be
if you're this obedient.

653
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,190
Come in.

654
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,989
Chief Editor.

655
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,310
Chu Li can't do this.

656
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,270
How did she offend you again?

657
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,190
She didn't offend me.

658
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,750
I think her capability

659
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,420
and working attitude are problematic.

660
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,949
Look.

661
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,380
She always leave the office

662
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,469
without a reason.

663
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,550
Then,

664
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,150
she'll try to defy her leaders.

665
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,030
She didn't contribute
to the publishing house at all.

666
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,420
I think

667
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,110
she's not suitable to work here.

668
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:03,190
You mean...

669
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,550
I mean

670
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,340
we should end her probation early.

671
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,740
That's going against the regulations.

672
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,430
There's no regulations about it.

673
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,140
Look, Chief Editor.

674
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,350
The current situation of

675
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,670
our office is obvious.

676
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,100
We can't afford to employ useless people.

677
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,670
You gave her time

678
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,990
to sign Zhou Chuan with us.

679
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,110
But I think

680
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,750
she'll never get it done

681
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,430
no matter how much time you give her.

682
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,550
If that's so,

683
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,420
I'd rather we place our concentration

684

Even though she didn't get to
sign Jiang Yu Cheng,

686
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,460
but

687
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,340
Mr He Ma had signed under us.

688
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,030

through our publishing house.

690
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,350
She had already exceeded our expectations.

stay or departure

in our meeting today.

705

The both of them weren't allowed to stay

706
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,310
because they failed their tasks.

707
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,590
But Xiao Niao

708
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,590
was able to contact Mr He Ma

709
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,190
and obtained his copyrights

710
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,350
for the next five years.

711
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,590
So, Xiao Niao gets to stay.

lost his seal for the contract?

729

Isn't there plenty of authors
who behaved like him?

730

Therefore, Chu Li.

So what if you can't accept it?

740
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,830
Will Zhou Chuan seal

00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,860
Get Uncle Zhou some fish.

853
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,270
I'm not used to serve food to others.

854
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,110
Others? Who's the others?

855
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,510
I'm your father!

856
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,660
When did you ever carry out
your duty as a father?

857
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,910
Look at him! Look at him!

858
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,790
He's already so arrogant now that

859
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,710
he accomplished nothing!

860
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,830
Old Zhou.

861
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,110
Your words might be too harsh.

862
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,300
From what I know,

863
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,380
Little Zhou's works are being prepared

864
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,070
for animation and gaming production.

865
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,900
Am I right?

866
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,830
Yes.

867
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,300
The aesthetics nowadays
are really crooked.

868
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,350
Those who are on trend

869
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,550
can be developed even
if they're at the tertiary level.

870
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,470
I think you're jealous of me.

871
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,790
Just by your level of expertise,

872
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,270
are you worthy of my jealousy?

873
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,670
I want to see

874
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,110
after a decade

875
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,150
if anyone will be interested
in your works.

876
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,070
I'm done eating.

877
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,110
Stop right there!

878
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,550
Zhou Chuan!

879
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,190
Old Zhou! Look at your fiery temper!

880
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,700
The lights are still on.

881
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,510
Where is he?

882
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,270
Behind you.
