<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 22</i>

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,460
See you, sir.

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,060
I’m here.

38
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,540
You said you have a way
to help Feixian out.

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,500
What is it?

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,020
It’s simple.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,220
But it depends on
how intimate you are

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,940
with her.

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,980
To save her, I’ll do anything.

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,140
Don’t speak so rashly.

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,460
You may not dare to do it.

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,140
If it can save her,

47
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,020
I’ll do whatever you ask.

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,660
Good.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,340
The only evidence to save Shi Feixian

50
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,660
is the copy your brother used

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,700
to imitate Count Cheng’an’s handwriting.

52
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,780
How’s it? You dare to do it?

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,300
One is your brother,

54
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,340
the other is your bosom friend.

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,660
Whom you will choose

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,420
is difficult to decide.

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,820
But you have to act quickly.

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,060
Shi Feixian will be condemned by

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,660
the Court of Judicial Review tomorrow.

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,260
Well...

61
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
<i>You are the only one in my heart.
See you at the west temple.</i>

62
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,540
Brother.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,860
What are you doing here, Your Grace?

64
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,580
Feixian,

65
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,220
she comes to help you out.

66
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,500
I’m afraid she’s happy to

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,860
see me here.

68
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,260
How could she help me?

69
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,100
Shi Feixian,

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,580
I’m sorry I wronged you that day.

71
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,700
I apologize.

72
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,100
I’m in the prison now.

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,500
What’s the use of apology?

74
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,020
I come here today

75
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,060
to ask you to be

76
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,020
my witness.

77
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,660
Find the one who forged the letter

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,940
and prove your innocence.

79
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,340
Forged?

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,500
It’s obviously true.

81
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,220
How could it be forged?

82
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,020
Feixian, don’t cheat yourself anymore.

83
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,980
It’s a critical time for you.

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,180
I don’t.

85
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,660
Since I worked hard in disaster relief,

86
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,380
His Grace began to admire me,

87
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,460
so he wrote to me,

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,740
asking me out and confessing his love.

89
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,460
Feixian,

90
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,300
Rong Xia loves Princess Ban,

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,900
and they’ve been engaged.

92
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,660
The letter is forged.

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,500
Brother.

94
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,380
Are you asking me to ruin

95
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,140
all my dignity

96
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,500
and my beautiful dream

97
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,260
in front of everyone?

98
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,220
Shi Feixian,

99
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,940
I can’t control Count Cheng’an’s mind,

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,540
and I’ll never give up my love

101
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,580
to you.

102
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,780
But,

103
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,660
the real one who did it
is unapprehended.

104
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,820
You and Count Cheng’an

105
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,940
shouldn’t be trapped here.

106
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,260
So, I’m asking you

107
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,220
to help me find out the truth.

108
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,580
When you clarified everything
in the court that day,

109
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,100
I thought you are not

110
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
the one who only

111
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,980
pretends to be weak and poor.

112
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,300
Why? Are you afraid?

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,220
It seems I overrated you.

114
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,740
Who tells you I’m afraid?

115
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,460
If you, Ban Hua,

116
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,860
can let go of your grudges
and beg me for Count Cheng’an,

117
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,260
how can I lose to you?

118
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,100
That’s it.

119
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,500
You are really the woman

120
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,180
I hate most in the whole country.

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,580
<i>After raining, I passed by my friend’s
village and saw a beautiful lady.</i>

122
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,860
This is written by Count Cheng’an?

123
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,980
This is a letter forged by Xie Chongjin.

124
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,740
Xie Chongjin?

125
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,940
I have no grudges against him.

126
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,340
Why should he frame me?

127
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,020
Xie Chongjin tried every means,

128
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,020
thinking he mastered everyone’s mind,

129
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,780
but he never expected

130
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,780
I will cooperate with you

131
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,140
one day.

132
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,860
Feixian,
if you’d like to be the witness,

133
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,420
we can find out the truth.

134
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,980
In the court trial tomorrow,

135
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,700
we can bring Xie Chongjin to justice.

136
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,500
Jin,

137
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,180
how’s your sister Feixian?

138
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,740
The prison is cold and hard.

139
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,540
She lost a lot of weight.

140
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,020
Grandpa, don’t worry too much.

141
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,860
Maybe she’ll be back

142
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,420
in a few days.

143
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,100
It has been a bad time for the Shis.

144
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,180
Besides the natural disaster,

145
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,220
we don’t get along well with the Bans.

146
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,140
Suyue makes His Majesty unhappy

147
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,340
because of your sister.

148
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,900
Suyue?

149
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,060
What’s wrong with her?

150
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,180
Don’t worry about her.

151
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,940
It’s more urgent to

152
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,500
solve Feixian’s matter.

153
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,740
Grandpa, don’t worry.

154
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,860
I’ve joined hands with Princess Ban.

155
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,380
In the court trial tomorrow,

156
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,380
we’ll bring Xie Chongjin to justice.

157
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,980
Xie Chongjin?

158
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,260
Isn’t he the subordinate of Prince Luo?

159
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,780
We’ve got all the evidence.

160
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
No matter whose subordinate he is,

161
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,260
he’ll be punished by Daye’s law.

162
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,540
Good.

163
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,060
If so, I’ll have to do something.

164
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,340
Jin.

165
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,660
Go get my official robe for me.

166
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,420
Are you going to enter the palace?

167
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,140
Yes.

168
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,220
If you want to arrest Xie Chongjin,

169
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,300
the Xies won’t let this happen.

170
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,660
I’ll report to His Majesty
as soon as possible,

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,420
so as not to hurt you and Feixian.

172
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,140
Jin,

173
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,180
you’re all my beloved.

174
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,220
How could I see you suffer?

175
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,180
But without evidence,

176
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,860
how could His Majesty believe me?

177
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,700
Grandpa.

178
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,340
Grandpa.

179
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,100
Feixian.

180
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,540
Grandpa, you’re here finally.

181
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,820
My brother must tell you everything.

182
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,100
I didn’t intend to stir the situation
and shame our family.

183
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,660
When I’m cleared tomorrow,

184
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,140
I’ll do more

185
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
to earn honor for our family.

186
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,740
Grandpa, I’ll get justice.

187
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,260
Why aren’t you happy?

188
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,900
Did you just come back from the palace?

189
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,340
What happened? Tell me!

190
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,940
His Majesty

191
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,020
will dethrone your sister
as crown princess.

192
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,500
It’s impossible.

193
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,180
My sister and Crown Prince
love each other so much.

194
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,460
His Majesty can’t...

195
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,300
Everything is possible for His Majesty.

196
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,580
Your sister offended the Bans

197
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,500
to help you out.

198
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,540
His Majesty said
she interfered with the court affairs,

199
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,900
so he wants to revoke her status.

200
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,140
Now, our family is doomed.

201
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,780
We won’t.

202
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,860
I’ll go find Ban Hua,

203
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,820
and ask her to plead for us.

204
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,460
I can go to Prince Luo, too.

205
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,100
He surely will help me.

206
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,540
Feixian.

207
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,700
What’s your relation with Prince Luo?

208
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,580
Grandpa.

209
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,820
I’m clear with him.

210
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,180
We don’t have any relation.

211
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,060
But His Majesty said

212
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,820
you induced Prince Luo with your pretty

213
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,620
and made him make such a mistake.

214
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,100
To save the face of the royal family,

215
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,580
he...

216
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,620
He’ll kill you.

217
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,980
His...

218
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,940
His Majesty will kill me?

219
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,300
Impossible.

220
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,500
Feixian, you know I love you the most.

221
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,180
Even I have to give up my official post,

222
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,300
and your sister’s status of
crown princess.

223
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,300
I will save your life.

224
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,060
But

225
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,180
even if I give up my official post

226
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,220
and your sister’s status,

227
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,380
it’s useless to His Majesty.

228
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,140
Grandpa.

229
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,100
There is only one way now.

230
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,900
What?

231
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,380
You admit that

232
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
it’s you who assassinated Duke Ban.

233
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,100
Only by this, you can save yourself.

234
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,820
Only by this, you can keep your life,

235
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
and save our family.

236
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,580
Are you coming here

237
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,260
to tell me this?

238
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,860
I’ll go plead His Majesty.

239
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,300
He will be lenient

240
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,420
and send you to Liangzhou.

241
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,780
No, Xizhou.

242
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,220
Don’t bother.

243
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,260
Even if I’m out of prison,

244
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,220
I’ll be despised by others.

245
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,620
Feixian.

246
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,220
Only by expelling me,

247
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,100
can the Shis

248
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,820
keep the previous glory.

249
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,220
Only if I keep my position,

250
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,860
and your sister keeps hers,

251
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,620
can we save you.

252
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,300
But I didn’t do that.

253
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,980
You’re my grandpa.

254
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,940
Shouldn’t you seek justice for me?

255
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,740
Like what Duke Jingting did.

256
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,100
No matter whom bullied his daughter,

257
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,460
he’d seek justice for her,

258
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,980
spoil her, and protect her

259
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,460
from a little bit of harm.

260
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,060
Isn’t that what a family should do?

261
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,940
What kind of people are they?

262
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,740
He’s a hooligan.

263
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,020
We’re officials for generations.

264
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,940
Can they compare with us?

265
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,380
No, they can’t.

266
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,180
Since I was born,

267
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,660
I’m just a commodity for sale,

268
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,580
but Ban Hua is a real person.

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,540
I know what to do.

270
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,420
Grandpa, you can go now.

271
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,340
<i>Shi Feixian admitted her crime,
and is expelled to Xizhou</i>

272
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,100
Miss Shi, think it over.

273
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,020
If you press your fingerprint,

274
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,500
the expel will never be revoked.

275
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,860
<i>End: Shi Feixian admitted her crime,
and is expelled to Xizhou</i>

276
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,020
Thank you for reminding me.

277
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,740
We didn’t teach her well,

278
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,540
so she made such a big mistake.

279
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,940
She should be punished for the crime.

280
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,540
Stop it!

281
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,620
Grandpa, you...

282
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,500
Shi Feixian, it’s not you,

283
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,460
why did you admit it?

284
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,260
Didn’t we reach an agreement?

285
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,460
Your Grace,

286
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,900
the one who assassinated your father

287
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,420
is me.

288
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,780
I don’t know what dirty things

289
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,140
you did in the dark.

290
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,460
With me here today,

291
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,420
I will never watch you treat

292
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,460
Shi Feixian unjustly.

293
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,020
Shi Jin, evidence.

294
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Show it to Mr. Liu.

295
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,020
I...

296
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,140
Where’s it?

297
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,220
I’d like to thank you, Your Grace.

298
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,860
But everything is done.

299
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,460
Please go back now.

300
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,140
It’s you!

301
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,020
You took the evidence, right?

302
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,460
You know it’s not her, right?

303
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,220
Shi Feixian is your own granddaughter.

304
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,300
Why did you force her to admit it?

305
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,500
Is it because the criminal
is Xie Chongjin?

306
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,660
and Prince Luo?

307
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,380
Minister Shi,

308
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,820
you’re selling your grandchild
for success.

309
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
Shut up!

310
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,540
It doesn’t matter if you slander me.

311
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,060
But how can you speak ill

312
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,100
of the royal family?

313
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,660
I never expect
you’re such a kind of person.

314
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,380
I’m so disappointed in you.

315
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,620
Your Grace, I...

316
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,620
Now that you won’t find it out,

317
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,260
I’ll do it.

318
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,380
I don’t care he’s an official
or a prince,

319
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,460
I believe there is justice in the world.

320
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,060
Your Grace,
do you mean His Majesty is unjust?

321
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,220
Minister Shi, you’re wrong.

322
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,980
Her Grace means

323
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,660
there is justice in everyone’s heart.

324
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,500
But what you have done today

325
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,500
is so impressive.

326
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,700
Her Grace won’t forget.

327
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,700
I won’t forget either.

328
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,980
It’s easy for me to help you out.

329
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,740
Your Grace, don’t thank me.

330
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,980
Hua!

331
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,380
Hua!

332
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
With Mr. Shi’s personality,

333
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,500
if it’s not His Majesty’s intention,

334
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,020
he won’t do this.

335
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,940
This is not the capital where I grew up.

336
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,700
Shi Feixian is not wrong,

337
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,060
but she’s expelled.

338
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Hua, if they don’t find it out,

339
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,420
you and I

340
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,020
still can do it.

341
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,620
Your Grace,

342
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,540
I can see the intrigues behind it,

343
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,580
but I don’t want to behave like that.

344
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,220
But

345
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,820
maybe I’m wrong.

346
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,900
Hua, you’re not wrong.

347
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,020
I want to go home.

348
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Fine. I’ll send you home.

349
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,940
I want to stay alone and think it over.

350
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,740
<i>Wude Mansion</i>

351
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,660
Prince Luo, why are you in such a hurry?

352
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,540
Where are you going?

353
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,220
It’s just in time. Where is my father?

354
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,580
His Majesty has an order.

355
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,220
He asked me to bring you a message.

356
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,180
What did Father say?

357
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,500
His Majesty asked you not to go out.

358
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,140
It’s impossible.

359
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,660
I want to see Father. Feixian...

360
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,980
Prince Luo, His Majesty and Her Highness

361
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,460
have known what you want to say.

362
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,340
Please go back to your mansion.

363
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,780
Don’t disappoint His Majesty

364
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,460
and Her Highness.

365
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,740
Come on. See Prince Luo off.

366
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,820
Please!

367
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,180
After some thought, I decided to

368
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,140
abolish the system of two ministers.

369
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Shi Chonghai will be
the only Prime Minister

370
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,900
and lead all the officials.

371
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,620
Shi Jin is promoted to
Commander of Imperial Guards

372
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,700
to safeguard the security of the palace.

373
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,500
The end.

374
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,940
Your Majesty, the Shis has a daughter

375
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,220
who’s expelled.

376
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,020
How could he be Prime Minister?

377
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,340
Do you have any objections?

378
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,980
I...

379
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,540
I dare not. I dare not.

380
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,100
But Duke Ban has.

381
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,740
Look,
he’s so angry that his head swells.

382
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,020
Your Majesty, my head was hit by others.

383
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
If there’s an objection,

384
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,500
it’s from Count Xie.

385
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,620
Look, his face is red.

386
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,500
Is my face red?

387
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,300
Of course.

388
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,580
That’s because you made me angry.

389
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,060
You can say what you want.

390
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,740
Don’t feel ashamed.

391
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,580
You’re making things worse.

392
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,780
I find you are...

393
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,060
-Enough!
-No one can do it.

394
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,300
Do you have anything else to report?

395
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,980
Dismiss.

396
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,540
Dismiss!

397
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,380
See you, Your Majesty.

398
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,220
Commander Shi, you...

399
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,300
I want to see His Majesty,

400
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,740
and ask His Majesty
to take back his order.

401
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,020
My sister is innocent.

402
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,820
His Majesty is resting at the harem.

403
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,620
It’s useless for you to kneel here.

404
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,380
Minister, you come just in time.

405
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
Mr. Shi is so stubborn.

406
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,540
If he annoys His Majesty,

407
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I’m afraid
he’ll be charged with insurrection.

408
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,860
Come on, stand up!

409
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,700
Do you hear me? Stand up!

410
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,820
How dare you not attend the meeting

411
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,580
and come here to force His Majesty?

412
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,980
What on earth do you want?

413
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,020
Right is right and wrong is wrong.

414
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,900
Even His Majesty is angry,

415
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,460
I will take the responsibility alone,

416
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,180
and not get the Shis involved.

417
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,580
Absurd!

418
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,460
Who do you think you are?

419
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,260
If you are not from the Shis,

420
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,460
you should be on the battlefield

421
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,580
and live a risky life.

422
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,300
How could you become like this?

423
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,900
You are the imperial commander now,

424
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,860
the third highest position.

425
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,140
I’d rather His Majesty revoke his order

426
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,260
and send me to the borderline

427
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,100
to return Feixian’s innocence.

428
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,660
You... Foolish!

429
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,580
Do you want to see

430
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,620
all our family members being killed

431
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,820
because of this?

432
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,460
Wait!

433
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,540
Feixian.

434
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,340
What are you doing here?

435
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,380
Feixian, sorry to see you suffering.

436
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,260
I end like this.

437
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,100
Is your family satisfied?

438
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,900
Feixian, you misunderstood me.

439
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
To save you...

440
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,860
I don’t have a friend like you.

Let’s go.

444
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,460
I prepared these for you.

445
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,980
You may need it on the way.

446
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,500
I never expected

447
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,580
the only one to see me off

448
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,740
is Your Grace.

449
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,500
I’m sorry.

450
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,180
You did nothing wrong.

451
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,980
You needn’t apologize.

452
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,740
Although I’m in a prison van,

453
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,820
I’m not a prisoner.

454
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,100
No matter where I live,

455
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,580
I am still

456
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,620
that Shi Feixian who’s unapproachable.

457
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,900
The title of the noblest lady in Daye

458
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,780
belongs to you now.

459
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,580
I hope you can do as you wish as always.

460
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,060
Don’t waste this title.

461
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,780
I won’t lose to you.

462
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,420
I won’t lose to anyone.

463
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,140
Your Grace, before I go,

464
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,700
I’d like to ask you a question.

465
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Over the past years,

466
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,460
have you ever

467
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,340
had a feeling for me?

468
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,940
In my heart,

469
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,260
I only love Hua from the beginning.

470
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
How am I worse than Her Grace?

471
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,740
You are good,

472
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,420
but it has nothing to do with me.

473
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,420
How I hope

474
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,660
that letter was written by you.

475
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,100
Time is up! Let’s go!

476
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,380
Yes!

477
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Rong Xia,

478
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,420
why should a girl

479
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,660
sacrifice for her family?

480
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,500
She’s innocent,

481
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,460
but is sent to Xizhou.

482
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,460
Hua.

483
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,380
You have done a lot.

484
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,500
I’ll ask others

485
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,420
to protect Shi Feixian on the way.

486
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,420
But I won’t let

487
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,980
Jiang Luo go for this.

488
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,260
With your own power,

489
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,380
how could you fight against a prince?

490
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,700
I’ve never been alone.

491
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,980
Jin!

492
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,700
I’ve told you

493
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,620
the whole story.

494
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,420
What are you going to do?

495
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,940
Feixian is expelled today.

496
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,780
As her brother,

497
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,820
I can’t let her

498
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,780
leave alone.

499
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,980
What can you do by yourself?

500
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,700
His Majesty has decided

501
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,220
to put a lid on the matter.

502
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,260
You still want to change it?

503
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,820
When will you let it go?

504
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,940
Do you think the lives of
all the family members

505
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,220
are less important than your sister?

506
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,460
Grandpa, don’t cheat yourself.

507
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,660
You gave up Feixian not for
the lives of the family members,

508
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,540
but for the high position.

509
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,380
Young Master,

510
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,620
you misunderstand him.

511
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,380
None of your business!

512
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,700
Stop!

513
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,940
If you insist on doing so,

514
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,300
you can go after

515
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,180
you kill me.

516
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,460
<i>Zhang, please read this letter carefully</i>

517
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,740
<i>Zhang, please read this letter carefully</i>
Without my good writing skills,

518
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,540
Prince Luo won’t have today’s success!

519
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,340
Brother!

520
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,620
Brother!

521
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,740
Please find a way to save Feixian.

522
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,900
I tried so hard to send her away.

523
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,580
Why should I save her?

524
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,260
If she comes back,

525
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,260
you may lose your position

526
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,420
as the crown princess.

527
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
I don’t care whether
I can be the crown princess or not.

528
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,260
But Feixian is innocent.

529
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,780
Innocent?

530
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,980
Wanyu, there are many innocent people.

531
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,300
If we want a higher position,

532
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,220
someone must be sacrificed.

533
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,100
What I did

534
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,020
is for your good,

535
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,620
and for the family’s good.

536
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,380
You liar!

537
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,060
You did it just for yourself.

538
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,300
Since you arranged my marriage
with Prince Luo,

539
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,620
I’m just a pawn to you,

540
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,780
or a bird you raised.

541
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,540
I am a joke.

542
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,300
I am a joke in the eyes of

543
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,180
all the people in the capital.

544
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,540
Fine.

545
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,980
Tell me then,

546
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,020
what on earth do you want?

547
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,700
I want Feixian to come back.

548
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,980
She’s the only one who cares about me.

549
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,540
Wanyu!

550
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,620
Wanyu!

551
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,100
Young Master.

552
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,860
Where are we going at such a late time?

553
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,260
Hua doesn’t want to stop here.

554
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,140
I have to help her seek justice.

555
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,100
So I decide to ask Xie Chongjin.

556
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,140
Young Master,

557
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,220
are you as crazy as Her Grace?

558
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,900
How can Xie Chongjin tell you the truth?

559
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,380
I’m afraid

560
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,940
he won’t see you at such time.

561
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,820
So I ask you to come with me.

562
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:42,900
Young Master.

563
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,500
Wanyu!

564
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Wanyu, you can’t be so self-willed.

565
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,820
Wanyu!

566
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,380
Wanyu, time to go back to Wude Palace.

567
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,020
It’s so late!

568
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,500
Why doesn’t Xie Chongjin come?!

569
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,100
Is it that

570
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,860
His Majesty knew our plan

571
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,300
and arrested Xie Chongjin?

572
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,460
Someone! Someone!

573
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,740
Someone, come!

574
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,420
How could she run in such a hurry?

575
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,300
If not that I have to use your family...

576
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,540
Right, Xie Chongjin...

577
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,500
Ban Hua, why do you come to my mansion?

578
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,900
What do you want?

579
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,460
Nothing.

580
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,260
I just want to have a talk with you.

581
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,460
I have nothing to talk with you.

582
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,700
Go out now!

583
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,300
Without Xie Chongjin,

584
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,740
you look so anxious!

585
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,740
Ban Hua, what will you do to me?

586
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,900
Ban Hua! Ban Hua!

587
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,580
You dare to act wildly in my mansion,

588
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,980
my father won’t forgive you!

589
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,220
Will His Majesty see you?

590
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,020
I heard that

591
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,300
you’re ordered to be grounded.

592
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,100
So what?

593
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,220
I am His Majesty’s own son.

594
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,100
When His Majesty sees me...

595
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,060
How could you know

596
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,860
you can see His Majesty again?

597
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,820
Ban...Ban Hua!

598
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,980
If you kill me,
all your family members will be killed.

599
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,540
Don’t worry. I won’t kill you.

600
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,940
I come here today

601
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,180
to make a deal with you.

602
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,700
I’ll never surrender to a threat,

603
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,500
or make a deal with others.

604
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,460
It seems you don’t care about

605
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,540
Shi Feixian’s life.

606
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,180
What do you mean?

607
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,660
What did do to her?

608
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I never expected that

609
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,660
you love Shi Feixian so much.

610
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,300
Ban Hua,

611
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,340
if you don’t make yourself clear today,

612
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,500
I won’t let you leave here.

613
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,300
I don’t care whether I can leave or not.

614
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,060
But the killers to kill Shi Feixian

615
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,020
are on the way.

616
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,780
Don’t you worry?

617
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,500
How dare you!

618
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,660
If you hurt Shi Feixian a little bit,

619
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,940
I’ll kill you!

620
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,260
Don’t be so anxious! It’s not me.

621
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,300
I don’t have such grudges against her.

622
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,300
But

623
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,020
don’t you always think you’re clever?

624
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,220
Why are you fooled so much

625
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,300
by your counselor?

626
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,140
Nonsense!

627
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,100
How could Xie Chongjin treat her...

628
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,340
Xie Wanyu will marry you.

629
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,260
But everyone knows

630
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,020
you only love Shi Feixian.

631
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,220
Cousin, think it over.

632
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,060
Xie Chongjin follows you,

633
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,740
but he has no position or guarantee.

634
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,460
Although his sister married you,

635
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,820
Shi Feixian is the only one you love.

636
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,020
What will he get?

637
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,620
Now Shi Feixian is on the way to Xizhou,

638
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,260
it’s a good opportunity to kill her.

639
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,340
In the whole country,

640
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,660
who is more eager than Young Master Xie

641
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,380
to kill Shi Feixian?

642
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,780
I know Xie Chongjin better than you.

643
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,380
I won’t fall into your traps.

644
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,100
Really?

645
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,300
It seems that it is you

646
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,580
who ordered others to frame Shi Feixian

647
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,300
for killing my dad.

648
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,700
But

649
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,300
don’t worry too much.

650
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,140
I, Ban Hua,

651
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,340
won’t stand by
and watch Shi Feixian get killed.

652
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,420
I’ve arranged secret protectors for her.

653
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,180
Hua, where is Shi Feixian now?

654
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,300
I won’t tell you.

655
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,180
Do you believe I’ll kill you now?

656
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,060
If so, you’ll never see her.

657
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,740
Ban Hua,

658
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,140
tell me, what are your conditions?

659
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,540
You’re really clever.

660
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,860
You understand me so fast.

661
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,220
I only have a few conditions.

662
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,460
First,

663
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,780
don’t touch the people of my family.

664
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,060
Second,

665
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,180
stop coveting the throne.

666
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,020
Third,

667
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,580
from now on,

668
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,420
greet me when you see me.

669
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,780
Impossible!

670
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,180
No hurry. Another one.

671
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,820
What’s this?

672
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,060
Repentance letter for hitting my dad.

673
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,820
Sign it.

674
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,780
It means you apologize for your crime.

675
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,060
Why it says I’m brutal, cold-blooded
and worse than pigs or dogs?

676
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,860
Ban Hua, don’t go too far!

677
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,540
Will you sign it or not?

678
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,900
No! In your dream!

679
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,540
I was born as a noble!

680
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,700
How could I lower my head
to apologize to you?

681
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,860
Do you think I like your apology?

682
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,740
If you don’t sign it,
I’ll take it as you deny your crime.

683
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,540
If you deny it,

684
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,780
Shi Feixian couldn’t clear her name.

685
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,020
If she couldn’t, who can save her?

686
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,900
Just think about it.

687
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,300
Alright,

688
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,340
I’ll lower my head this time.

689
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,380
But Ban Hua, remember it,

690
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,700
I’m not afraid of you.

691
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,300
I’m just doing it for Shi Feixian.

692
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,660
It’s out of thin air. I won’t admit it.

693
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,340
<i>Jiang Luo</i>

694
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,380
That’s right.

695
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,780
<i>Jiang Luo</i>

696
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,860
I am so sorry

697
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,540
for taking you here like this.

698
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Kidnap me.

699
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,820
Haven’t you thought
about the consequence?

700
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,860
Anyone else

701
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,420
may report this to Prince Luo,

702
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,420
but you won’t.

703
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,100
You are a smart person.

704
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,940
You’re good at reading other’s minds.

705
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,220
So am I.

706
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,620
You imitated my handwriting at first,

707
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,220
and led Miss Shi to the trap.

708
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,740
Then you hired an assassin
to murder Duke Jingting,

709
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,900
provoking the conflict
between the Shis and the Bans,

710
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,540
and involving me in it.

711
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,180
But what will

712
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,300
Prince Luo and the Xies

713
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,540
get from this?

714
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,100
I thought for a long time.

715
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,340
Finally, I figured it out.

716
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,700
You are just betting that

717
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,380
Prince Luo will ascend to the throne.

718
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,260
To get the position of Empress
for the Xies,

719
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,220
you must kill Shi Feixian first.

720
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,460
You murdered Duke Jingting

721
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,260
because you know the crown prince will
plead for his beloved

722
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,580
and annoy His Majesty.

723
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,020
So that you can strike
crown prince’s position.

724
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,420
I’ve said that long ago

725
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,420
you’re my doomed rival.

726
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,220
You are cautious enough

727
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,180
and even take a further step.

728
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,500
Maybe you haven’t told Prince Luo

729
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,460
the killers you sent to kill Shi Feixian

730
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,020
are on the way.

731
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,660
What do you mean by this?

732
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,460
I don’t understand.

733
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,140
Miss Shi is a thousand miles away.

734
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,300
Even she has an accident.

735
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,740
What’s the matter with me?

736
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,420
I’m so ashamed that

737
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,380
I can’t imitate others’ handwriting

738
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,780
as good as you.

739
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,660
I’ve never expected

740
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,980
Count Cheng’an

741
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,540
may break into other’s house
to steal things.

742
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,780
If Jiang Luo knows
that letter was written by you,

743
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,500
Xie Wanyu’s title of the crown princess,

744
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,420
no,

745
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,820
all the Xies may disappear.

746
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,620
Count Cheng’an,
if you really want to do this,

747
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,540
you won’t meet me here.

748
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,980
Except the murder of Duke Jingting,

749
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,180
you must have some other things to ask.

750
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,740
Please tell me directly.

751
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,380
Thank you.

752
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,740
The day before yesterday,

753
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,740
our butler died from a cart accident.

754
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,420
It’s really strange,
but it must have a reason.

755
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,380
Is the killer from your Fude House?

756
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,820
Fude House makes deals by rules.

757
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,180
We just take money
and do what we’re asked,

758
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,540
without asking reasons.

759
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,860
I’m afraid I can’t help you with this.

760
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,340
The rules or the Xies,
which is more important.

761
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,420
You can have a think.

762
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,700
As I expect,

763
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,740
you still can’t let go of your revenge.

764
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,980
Stop!

765
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,860
Who’s standing in the way!

766
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,820
If you want to pass from here,

767
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,620
you should ask for my permission first.

768
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,260
How dare you!

769
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,660
You dare to stop the official carts!

770
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,620
It’s far away from the capital!

771
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,060
What can you do to me?

772
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,500
You!

773
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,420
Fight!

774
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,420
Report!

775
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,980
The carts with female prisoners
are attacked by bandits!

776
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,300
As Hua expected,

777
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,860
Xie Chongjin wants to take
this opportunity to kill Shi Feixian.

778
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,740
Everyone!

779
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,420
Yes!

780
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,380
Save her!

781
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,900
Next one!

782
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,860
Go! Next one!

783
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,860
You! Come here!

784
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,940
Go, go, go!

785
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,300
You! Turn around!

786
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,820
I said you! Turn around!

787
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,700
Such a tender skin.

788
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,060
She doesn’t look like a prisoner.

789
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,100
How dare you rob the official carts!

790
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,060
Catch all of them!

791
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,660
It’s her! Catch her!

792
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,420
Go!

793
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,380
Stop!

794
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,060
Freeze!

795
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,620
Run! Where are you running to?

796
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,060
I’m the granddaughter
of the Prime Minister,

797
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,500
and the Crown Princess’s sister.

798
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,140
If you hurt me,

799
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,220
do you know the result?

800
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,100
It’s your bad luck.

801
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,660
You were born in the wrong family.

802
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,460
Let go of me.

803
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,740
-Come here!
-Let go!

804
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,700
Bro!

805
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,580
I’m the noblest lady in Daye.

806
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,420
How could I be humiliated like this?

807
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,420
I can’t get what I love.
I won’t be happy in this life.

808
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,660
If there is a next life,

809
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,540
I wish to be an ordinary girl

810
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,380
and no longer be fooled by might.
