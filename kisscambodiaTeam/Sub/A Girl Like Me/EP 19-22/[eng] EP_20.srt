35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 20</i>

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,310
Young Master.

37
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,710
Congratulations!

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,430
Congratulations. You are
the Minister of Revenue now.

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
Young Master Ban. Hua.

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Father told us about
what happened in court.

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,030
I thought Hua would
tell on the Shi family

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,870
because of the roast chicken.

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I didn’t expect you to praise them.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,030
I was going to tell on her.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
But after second thoughts,

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,840
if the refugees

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
can’t have meat because of me,

48
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,960
then I would be the bad person.

49
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,080
Therefore, I started to compliment her,

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,080
and also make His Majesty
compliment her.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,430
Then she has to keep
giving out roast chickens.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,960
That’s right. Let her do it.

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Her family will die of poverty.

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
I’m not that bad as you.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,080
First of all,

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,360
it’s not a bad thing

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,750
for the refugees to have more meat.

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,520
Everyone is having a good time,

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
and I’m not losing anything.

60
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,000
Second,

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,910
I have to let Shi Feixian know

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,800
that she will make trouble
if she horses around.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
But she won’t listen to me.

64
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,870
It’s better to

65
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,520
let her wait and see the result.

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
I have reminded her anyway.

67
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,960
Hua, you have changed.

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,590
You’ve become a cunning fox now.

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,030
This is called turning her trick
against herself.

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,560
I learned it from my
grandfather’s military book.

71
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,840
It’s a counterplot.

72
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,400
I have to thank Hua
on behave of the refugees.

73
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,080
Minister Rong, you are welcome.

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,190
His Majesty was clearly
making it difficult for you.

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
Why did you accept
the imperial decree of

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,590
giving out roast chicken for one month?

77
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,960
The chicken doesn’t matter.
What matters is Qizhou.

78
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,030
Although I gave the runaround today,

79
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,080
I’m afraid His Majesty
would keep it in mind

80
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,430
and mention it again.

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,910
If it’s as you said,

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,080
the grandfather and grandson

83
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,240
should have blended in with
the refugees and fled Qizhou.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,280
They should have arrived at
the capital these days.

85
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,630
But there are too many
refugees in the capital.

86
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,190
I don’t know where to find them.

87
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,360
I heard that the kid
from the Zhao family likes chicken.

88
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,680
We can just wait for windfalls

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,950
to erase this clue

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,190
before His Majesty finds out.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,830
You are wise indeed.

92
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,430
Shunzi.

93
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,270
We haven’t had any meat

94
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,630
these days.

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,950
I’ll take you to
eat something good today.

96
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,630
Heng, you want to eat meat, right?

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,830
I don’t like meat.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,510
No, you do.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
You are shooting up.
You have to eat meat.

100
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,920
Sir.

101
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,870
Young Master Ban, welcome.

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
Come in, please.

103
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,950
Come on, sit.

104
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,360
Young Master Ban.

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you still want porridge today?

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
It has been many days.

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,830
A kid can’t only eat porridge.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
You are right.

109
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,270
He needs to eat something nutritive.

110
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,040
Okay.

111
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,600
I’ll have one large steamed chicken
with scallion oil.

112
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Young Master Ban, just so you know,

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
there is nothing lacking in the capital

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,270
but chicken.

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,360
No chicken?

116
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,510
Eggs will also work.

117
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,560
Think about it,

118
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,510
how can there be eggs without chickens?

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
Let alone eggs,

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,270
you can’t even find

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,680
a chicken feather on the street.

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,830
Where are the chickens?

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
All the chickens

124
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,480
were bought by the Shi family.

125
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
The Shi family?

126
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
Come on!

127
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,160
Don’t miss it!

128
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,750
What’s the noise?

129
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,160
It should be
the disaster relief assembly

130
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,750
organized by Miss Shi

131
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,510
and other well-known families.

132
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,830
Shi Feixian?

133
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,160
Disaster relief assembly?

134
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,560
Shunzi, let’s go take a look.

135
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,870
Come on.

136
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Young Master Ban, take care.

137
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,310
I’m bringing it to you.

138
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,000
There is a show over there.

139
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,800
Yes.

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
What’s happening?

141
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,950
There is a show of
the Six Fairies in the Bamboo Forest.

142
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,000
There will be no place later.

143
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,510
Streamed buns are better than fairies.

144
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,120
Let’s go eat food.

145
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,640
Okay.

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
Excellent!

147
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,270
Excellent!

148
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,720
That’s beautiful.

149
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,070
Shouldn’t there be six fairies?

150
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,120
Why are there five people?

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
What do you know?

152
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,510
There were six fairies.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
After Xie Wanyu
married the Second Prince,

154
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,720
she chose to be a concubine
rather than a fairy.

155
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,510
So there are only five fairies now.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,920
Shi Feixian, the one in the middle,

157
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,630
and Li Xiaoru are
two fairies in the sky.

158
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
What about the rest?

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go away.

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,750
The three fairies on the ground.

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,870
Great!

162
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,870
Excellent!

163
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,630
It sounds amazing.

164
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,170
Excellent!

165
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,950
<i>West Gate</i>
Excellent!

166
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,190
Great!

167
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,040
It sounds good!

168
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,830
You came all the way to the capital.

169
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,630
It’s fate that we gather here.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We prepared

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,070
basic necessities for you.

172
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,000
Please rest assured and enjoy it.

173
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Take the capital as your second home.

174
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,240
Good!

175
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,920
Miss Shi has a heart of gold!

176
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,840
Miss Shi has a heart of gold!

177
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
Miss Shi is the first fairy!

178
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,910
Great!

179
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,960
Miss Shi is the first fairy!

180
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,240
Well done!

181
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,320
-Great!
-Good!

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,630
Good! Good!

183
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,870
When did you come here?

184
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,870
I passed by

185
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
and was attracted by
the pleasing sound of the zither.

186
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,030
I’m flattered.

187
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
Miss Shi, you are too modest.

188
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,200
You are not only good at zither,

189
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,440
but also considerate.

190
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,550
It’s very thoughtful of you

191
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,390
to prepare so much for the refugees.

192
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to thank you for them.

193
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,120
You are overpraising me.

194
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,630
This is what I should do.

195
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,790
If all the ladies in Daye

196
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,270
can be like you,

197
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,870
the refugees are lucky indeed.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,910
There are many refugees out there,

199
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,630
I’m going to give out
roast chickens now.

200
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,240
Does anyone want porridge?

201
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,000
-Does anyone want porridge?
-Does anyone want porridge?

202
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,080
Does anyone want porridge?

203
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,910
Your Grace, why don’t we
upgrade our food?

204
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,030
It’s embarrassing to have no one here.

205
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,750
We are here to rescue people,

206
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,030
not to make us look good.

207
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,200
There is nothing to compare with them.

208
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
That’s right.

209
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
They only take one bite of each dish.

210
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,390
This food they threw away

211
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,910
can feed the whole Qizhou.

212
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,550
If they don’t eat it, I will.

213
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,550
I will eat it, too.

214
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,870
But there are people

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
who can’t even have
any porridge like this.

216
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,510
If there are still
hungry people out there

217
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,200
who feels faint because of hunger,

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,080
and they can come to our shed
to have a bowl of porridge

219
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,360
and fill the stomach,

220
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,440
that’s enough.

221
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,000
Your Grace is right.

222
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,750
Freshly roasted chicken
of the Shi family!

223
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,390
Delicious roast chicken
of the Shi family!

224
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,150
Thank you.

225
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,150
Freshly roasted chicken
of the Shi family!

226
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,670
Everyone has a share!

227
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,750
Come on!

228
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,910
Come to eat our delicious roast chicken!

229
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
Roast chicken?

230
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,630
Delicious roast chicken
of the Shi family!

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,630
No, for my sister’s reputation,

232
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,790
we can’t eat it.

233
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,150
Even to starve to death,

234
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,630
I won’t eat anything
from the Xie family.

235
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,030
Young Master Ban, do you want some?

236
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,840
Your food looks too plain,
I’m not interested.

237
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,630
I’ll put the noodles here.

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,120
Don’t feel restrained.

239
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,670
Your noodles are soft and greasy.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,240
It makes me lose my appetite.

241
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,960
It won’t be tasty.

242
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,480
I can’t let her fool people

243
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,510
with such unpalatable noodles.

244
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,080
I’ll just take one bite.

245
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,440
It’s delicious!

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,150
Shunzi, you...

247
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,150
Shunzi?

248
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,320
Shunzi!

249
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,320
Come, one for each person.
Everyone gets one!

250
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,360
Don’t push. One for each person.

251
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,550
One for each person!

252
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,480
You can only take one!

253
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,080
Stop!

254
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,910
Children are voracious.
It’s okay for them to take more.

255
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,120
Yes.

256
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,320
Here, have more.

257
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,790
Tell me if it’s not enough.

258
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,200
Thank you.

259
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,910
We need to find useful information

260
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,600
from these papers sent by
the agent in Qizhou.

261
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,750
I heard from the agent

262
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,550
that Official Zhao knew
he has nowhere to escape,

263
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,510
so he wrote a letter with his own blood,
accusing Prime Minister Shi,

264
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,200
and asked his mother and his son

265
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,960
to present the letter to His Majesty.

266
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,200
If the letter is
presented to His Majesty,

267
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,390
I’m afraid no one can
protect Shi Chonghai

268
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,390
no matter how many supporters he has.

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,840
But Prime Minister Shi should know

270
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,910
the existence of this letter.

271
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,080
Why hasn’t he made a move?

272
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,630
No, he has been looking for it.

273
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,200
You mean the disaster relief
of the Shi family is to find people?

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,080
Why do you stop talking?

275
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,120
The son of Official Zhao in Qizhou.

276
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,750
What happened to his son?

277
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,630
It’s Shunzi.

278
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,440
No, we have to tell Count Cheng’an now.

279
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,270
<i>Ban</i>

280
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,960
Young Master!

281
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,240
What happened?

282
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,960
Hua!

283
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,670
Bad news.

284
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
I lost Shunzi!

285
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,550
What?

286
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,550
You mean Shunzi is

287
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,870
the son of Official Zhao in Qizhou?

288
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,240
If Shunzi has the letter
written in blood,

289
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,910
it can prove the bribery is true.

290
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,960
Prime Minister Shi

291
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,200
won’t do nothing about it.

292
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,720
Hua!

293
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,200
We found him!

294
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,550
Where is he?

295
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,670
I asked Zhou Changxiao.

296
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,600
He said that all the orphans
in the capital

297
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,550
were sent to the Shi family’s
Charity House.

298
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,840
Shunzi is also there.

299
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,320
Charity House.

300
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Minister Shi is such a cunning fox.

301
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,550
Heng, where is this Charity House?

302
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
I mean, what are you talking about?

303
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,390
Ban Heng, lead the way.

304
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,750
I’m going to take him back
from the Charity House.

305
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,960
Step aside!

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
-Who are you?
-What do you want?

307
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,670
-You can’t go inside!
-You can’t go inside!

308
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,380
<i>Charity House</i>

309
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,120
<i>Charity House</i>
What’s wrong?

310
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,600
Why do you stop playing?

311
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,320
Brother.

312
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,960
I’m scared.

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,240
Mr. Shi, what’s this?

314
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,000
Your Grace, I...

315
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,120
No!

316
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,550
Give it to me!

317
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,670
-No!
-Give it to me!

318
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,730
-No! I won’t give it to you!
-Give it to me! Come on!

319
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,370
No!

320
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,390
-Hua.
-Give it to me!

321
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,670
Shunzi!

322
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,240
Shunzi!

323
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,080
No. I won’t give it to you!

324
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,550
Xia, Hua, you are all here.

325
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,390
Are you okay?

326
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,030
I’m fine. Brother Shi also gave me this.

327
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,750
This is really

328
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,870
your family’s Charity House.

329
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,510
Your Grace.

330
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,240
This is indeed our family’s
Charity House.

331
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,630
Well, these kids...

332
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,200
Come on, go to play.

333
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,480
Have fun. Be safe.

334
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,080
These are homeless children.

335
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,030
No matter how much food we give out,

336
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,750
they won’t get any.

337
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,390
Therefore, I gathered them here.

338
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,910
They can make friends here.
There are food

339
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,150
and teachers.

340
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,390
Living in such a yard,

341
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,150
they may be able to grow up

342
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,550
without being hungry and cold every day.

343
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,030
Sorry, I misunderstood you.

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,150
I didn’t expect the dignified
Commander of the Imperial Guard

345
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,440
is so kind and considerate.

346
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,270
Brother Shi!

347
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,800
Come to catch me!

348
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,790
Okay, I’ll do it one more time.

349
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,480
It’s getting late.

350
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,510
We should take Shunzi home earlier.

351
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,910
Young Master, we’ve got the evidence.

352
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,870
It’s the perfect time
to bring down the Shi family.

353
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,550
Young Master.

354
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,880
What is your concern?

355
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,000
Shunzi has no idea about
what happened to his family.

356
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,440
The key is to find the letter
written in blood.

357
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,720
Wang Qu.

358
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,310
Pay close attention to every move
of Prime Minister Shi’s henchmen.

359
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,680
Report to me immediately
if you have any news.

360
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,480
Yes.

361
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,880
What did you say?

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,070
Zhao Shunzi is at
Marquis Jingting’s mansion?

363
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,200
Exactly.

364
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,240
Minister.

365
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,830
What should we do?

366
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,960
Rong Xia accused me last time.

367
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,960
He is openly against me now.

368
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,400
If he gets the letter,

369
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,880
he will present it
to His Majesty immediately.

370
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,680
Zhao Shunzi has been staying

371
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,830
at the Ban family for half a month,

372
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,270
but nothing happens.

373
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,200
You mean they don’t have the letter?

374
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,200
Or they don’t know the identity

375
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,240
of Zhao Shunzi at all.

376
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,510
This cat is so cute.

377
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,200
What’s its name?

378
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,920
It’s called Huahua.

379
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,440
You also like cat?

380
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,790
Shunzi.

381
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,110
I have something to ask you.

382
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
On your way here,

383
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,480
did your grandma tell you anything?

384
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,240
No.

385
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,510
Did your grandma give you any stuff?

386
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,640
Stuff...

387
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,310
No.

388
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,400
By the way,

389
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,830
my grandma told me not to trouble Hua

390
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,440
and remember what my parents said.

391
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,590
What did your parents say?

392
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,400
My parents said
they don’t want anything.

393
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,270
They just want me to be happy

394
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,070
and be a good person after I grow up.

395
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,680
Are you sure you won’t keep asking him?

396
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Do you already know where the letter is?

397
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,270
It seems that Shunzi doesn’t know it.

398
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,550
But I will look into
this case thoroughly.

399
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,680
I won’t allow corrupt officials
to exploit the people.

400
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,110
Your Grace, go ahead and look into it.

401
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,350
Shunzi will stay with me.

402
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,640
No one dares to hurt him.

403
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,350
Shunzi is lucky to meet you.

404
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,000
After all,

405
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,310
I have never met such a cute

406
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,240
and sensible little brother in my life.

407
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,310
Hua, you are too harsh on Heng.

408
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,030
Although Heng is a little bit playful,

409
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,640
he has a pleasing personality.

410
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,270
He is not just playful,

411
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,200
he is unreliable. He only eats
and gambles every day.

412
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,240
He gets up at noon every day.

413
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,110
He is bad at learning
and worse at martial arts.

414
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,030
No matter how many flaws Heng has,

415
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,680
you still won’t allow anyone
to say anything bad about him.

416
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,400
Isn’t it?

417
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
Of course.

418
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,750
The more complicated our situation is,

419
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
the more I know

420
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
how much Grandma

421
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
silently did for us in those years.

422
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,510
Now Grandma is gone.

423
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,030
Ban Heng hasn’t grown up yet.

424
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,750
I’ve been thinking

425
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,830
how I can protect the Ban family

426
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,070
like Grandma did for us.

427
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,480
Hua, you’ve been doing a good job.

428
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,310
Haven’t you realized

429
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,880
that you can handle things alone

430
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,640
most of the time?

431
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,720
I’m not good enough.

432
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,200
It’s enough.

433
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,200
No.

434
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,550
I know nothing about
literature or politics.

435
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,200
But I know. That’s enough.

436
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,240
Isn’t it a waste to have
one more person knowing these things?

437
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,310
But I don’t know how to cook.

438
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
And I have a bad temper.

439
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,750
I don’t allow you

440
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,750
to say anything bad about yourself.

441
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,310
Since we swore an oath together

442
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,200
on that day,

443
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,000
I’ve decided,

444
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,160
no matter what difficulties
I will meet in the rest of my life,

445
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,070
I will guard the Ban family with you.

446
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I’ll protect you.

447
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,720
Green bean cake!

448
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,550
Delicious green bean cake!

449
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Green bean cake!

450
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,270
Sir.

451
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,160
Do you want a piece?

452
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,680
Here, take it.

453
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,550
Green bean cake!

454
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,550
Hua, it’s your favorite green bean cake.

455
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,200
There are many people watching us.

456
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,200
We are a perfect couple.

457
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,550
What does it matter?

458
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,350
Hua!

459
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,590
Father?

460
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,160
Where’s Father? Where’s Father?

461
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,270
He went to the Palace.

462
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,310
What did you dream of again?

463
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,960
It’s Father

464
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,440
who will be in trouble this time.

465
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,000
You’ve worked hard
for this disaster relief.

466
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,790
I’ve relieved.

467
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,750
Ban Huai.

468
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

469
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,240
I want you to take the position
of Deputy Prime Minister.

470
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,270
What do you think?

471
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,790
No. No.

472
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Your Majesty, thank you for your grace.

473
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,960
I have no ambition.

474
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,000
I can’t take the position
of Deputy Prime Minister.

475
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

476
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,110
This is a golden opportunity

477
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,160
that countless people
have been yearning for.

478
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,200
I know. I know.

479
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,590
Have you decided?

480
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,640
I’ve decided. I can’t take the position.

481
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,030
Your Majesty, I really can’t.

482
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,510
Since Marquis Ban has no intention.

483
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What about Count Xie?

484
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,720
Are you willing to take on
this important task?

485
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,350
Thank you for your appreciation!

486
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,830
I will shrink from no sacrifice!

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,920
Your Majesty, hold on!

488
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,640
What are you doing?

489
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,350
Your Majesty, after second thoughts,

490
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,640
I think a person

491
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,440
should change himself in his life.

492
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,960
I’m willing to assume the responsibility
of the Deputy Prime Minister.

493
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,550
You...!

494
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,240
Ban.

495
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
What do you mean?

496
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,350
His Majesty has appointed me.

497
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,830
What do you mean what I mean?

498
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,310
His Majesty asked me first.

499
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,110
I can’t reject His Majesty’s grace.

500
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,790
Is there any problem?

501
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,680
You...!

502
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,310
Your Majesty, the Deputy Prime Minister

503
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,240
should be a real talent.

504
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,880
Marquis Jingting has
little talent and knowledge.

505
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,750
I am afraid he is unqualified.

506
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,240
Your Majesty,
in terms of disaster relief,

507
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
the Ban family bears the brunt.

508
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,240
You...! You old...

509
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,680
Your Majesty.

510
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,110
I’ve been assuming a position
in court for twenty years.

511
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,160
I’ve made countless achievements.

512
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,640
I’m definitely the best candidate
for Deputy Prime Minister.

513
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,720
You said countless yourself,

514
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,350
which means there is no
achievement to count, Your Majesty.

515
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,880
You...!

516
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,510
All right, stop it.

517
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,510
Prime Minister Shi.

518
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
What’s your opinion?

519
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,920
Your Majesty, I think
that the major families

520
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,920
are all offering relief aid.

521
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,960
This is the top priority.

522
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,270
The position of Deputy Prime Minister
is too important

523
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,960
to be decided in such a short time.

524
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,160
What’s your opinion?

525
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,720
I think

526
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,960
Prime Minister Shi does have a point.

527
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,200
Father.

528
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,070
I’m not familiar with
the national affairs.

529
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,590
I shouldn’t make a comment.

530
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,440
In that case,

531
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,720
I’ll think about it.

532
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,880
Luo.

533
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,680
From now on, you will
go to court with me.

534
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,750
Pay more attention to national affairs,

535
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,790
so you can assist your brother more.

536
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,350
Thank you for your appreciation!

537
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,640
I’m truly grateful!

538
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,030
I’m truly grateful!

539
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,270
Get off!

540
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,160
What?

541
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,920
Make way for Deputy Prime Minister Ban.

542
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,830
I won’t!

543
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,510
What are you doing?

544
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Blabbermouth.

545
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,310
You old bastard!

Was His Majesty satisfied with you?

549
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
It was just as you expected.

550
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,720
Father changed his attitude towards me.

551
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,680
He asked me to go to the court
and get familiar with national affairs.

552
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,680
Congratulations, Your Highness.

553

Chongjin.

554
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,000
You didn’t let me down this time.

555
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,070
But it’s ridiculous that Father actually
asked Ban Huai to be

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,680
the Deputy Prime Minister.

557
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Your Highness, rest assured.

558
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,440
Ban Huai won’t become
the Deputy Prime Minister.

559
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,110
You are going to
make a move against him?

560
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,070
Good.

561
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,000
In this way,

562
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,160
the position of Deputy Prime Minister

563
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,880
will be your father’s.

564
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,110
He can check the power

565
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,590
of the Crown Prince for me.

566
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,240
Someone in the court will do it.

567
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,030
Who?

568
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,400
Prime Minister Shi is already overwhelmed
by the letter written in blood.

569
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,240
If Ban Huai gets promoted,

570
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,960
the inside story of Qizhou
will be harder to conceal.

571
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,310
You want me to work with
Prime Minister Shi?

572
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,350
No.

573
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,350
Just cut to the chase.

574
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,110
If you don’t say it,

575
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,160
I’ll throw you out of the carriage.

576
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,160
Your Highness, be patient.

577
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,400
I have a plan.

578
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,000
The third party benefits
from the tussle.

579
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,830
Why can’t I be
the Deputy Prime Minister?

580
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,160
Don’t forget.

581
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,350
I brought Yan Hui down

582
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,510
in person back then.

583
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,310
Come on, Father.

584
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,440
If it wasn’t for Count Cheng’an,

585
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,000
you would have been

586
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,000
gnawed out of with no bones left.

587
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,270
You are good at playing cards.

588
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,750
As for the way of being an official...

589
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
I’m the son of Princess Royal

590
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,110
and Old General Ban.

591
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,550
I grew up learning from them.

592
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,590
By the way,

593
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,000
tomorrow we should go to
the ancestral hall

594
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,790
and pay respects to our parents.

595
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,550
I need to let them know

596
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,590
that their son is a big figure now!

597
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,240
What’s more,

598
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,880
you will be the wife
of Deputy Prime Minister soon,

599
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,590
you should learn from

600
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,350
Mrs. Yan.

601
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,510
Look at her style.

602
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,030
-Master...
-You mean

603
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,830
I’m not as good as that Mrs. Yan.

604
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,920
Dear, I didn’t say that.

605
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,400
Keep reading the account book.

606
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,590
Read the account book.

607
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Father.

608
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,590
I agree with Heng.

609
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,920
It concerns the situation of the court.

610
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,350
I’m afraid you will
get yourself into trouble.

611
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,270
My dear daughter.

612
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,110
You don’t know it.

613
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,790
This is a war between me
and that blabbermouth.

614
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,200
All right, I should leave.

615
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,110
Don’t wait for me for dinner.

616
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,680
Dad, where are you going?

617
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,000
I should have an understanding of
the people’s lives

618
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,110
and be prepared for the campaign.

619
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,920
I can’t lose to that blabbermouth.

620
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
Close the door, Softy!

621
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,790
Yes!

622
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,550
No, you...!

623
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,680
First thing first.

624
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,680
As long as there is
a slight chance of this happening,

625
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,270
you have to stay at home.

626
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,480
Master, just listen to Hua.

627
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,880
Well...

628
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,110
How long should I stay at home?

629
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,400
In my dream, it happens in early spring,

630
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
which means you can go out in summer.

631
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,440
Summer?

632
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,510
Daughter.

633
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,550
I’m also doing this for our family.

634
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,350
You can’t support the whole family

635
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,310
all by yourself.

636
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
Besides, we can’t count on

637
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,030
your useless little brother at all.

638
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,680
I...

639
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,640
You have to

640
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,510
let me go out and do my things.

641
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,350
Dad, it’s about your life.

642
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,750
I won’t give in.

643
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,440
Who dares to stop me!

644
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,350
What are you doing? You...!

645
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,920
Well...

646
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,270
Looks like this time

647
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,030
I’m going to lose to Blabbermouth.

648
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,200
You guys.

649
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,200
Guard every corner

650
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,960
of Ban’s mansion.

651
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,070
If you notice any suspicious person,
take him down immediately.

652
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,640
Yes! Let’s go!

653
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,590
Let’s go!

654
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,830
Master is gone!

655
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,310
You locked me up.

656
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,000
How can I not come out?

657
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,070
I can’t lose to Blabbermouth.

658
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,100
<i>Furui Clothing Store</i>

659
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,880
Sir.

660
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,960
How is your business?

661
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,070
Your Excellency! Have a seat.

662
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,750
Okay.

663
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,440
Sit down. I’ll get some tea for you.

664
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,510
I am thirsty.

665
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,590
This tea is freshly brewed.

666
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,790
Your Excellency,
why are you dressing like this?

667
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,350
I want to

668
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
experience the feeling
of being a servant.

669
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,510
Not good looking?

670
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,640
Good, very good. Excellent.

671
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,200
Your Excellency deserves your title.

672
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,640
You are unique and extraordinary.

673
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,880
Your Excellency, what do you
want to buy today?

674
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,350
Right.

675
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,440
I need to show my prestige

676
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,720
as the Deputy Prime Minister
in a few days.

677
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,590
Well,

678
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,550
go and get me the best
and the most expensive

679
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,270
suit you have. Go ahead.

680
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,640
All right, Your Excellency.

681
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,680
Wait for me.

682
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,920
Hua.

683
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,830
Did you find him?

684
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,590
No.

685
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
I’ve checked all the places
he usually visits. He is not there.

686
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,920
I’m afraid Father knows
that we will look for him,

687
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,550
so he avoided the stores
he usually visits.

688
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,880
Hua, could your dream
be wrong this time?

689
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,960
I remember it was inaccurate
several times.

690
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,270
Will Dad be fine this time?

691
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,200
Green bean cake!

692
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,030
Delicious green bean cake!

693
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,880
You want a piece?

694
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,880
Green bean cake!

695
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,960
Hua.

696
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,310
It’s today.

697
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,830
Father!

698
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,960
Ban Huai, stop!

699
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,920
Daughter, we can talk.

700
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,750
You don’t need to beat me.

701
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
Let’s talk.

702
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,550
Father!

703
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,350
Father!

704
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,640
-Father!
-Father!

705
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,480
Father!

706
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,350
What should we do?

707
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,920
Uncle!

708
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,480
-These bastards!
-Hua!

709
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,000
Let’s save Uncle first.

710
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,640
Father.

711
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Heng, send Father home.

712
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,480
Then go get Physician Yu immediately.

713
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,360
What about you?

714
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I would like to see

715
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,480
who is bold enough to make a move
against our Ban family!

716
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
-Hua...!
-Hua!

717
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,760
Father.

718
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,440
Your Grace, you can
interrogate him as you want.

719
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,190
This restaurant is
the Rong family’s business.

720
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,510
Tell me.

721
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,150
Who asked you to do it?

722
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,630
Even if you kill me today,

723
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,840
I won’t say a word.

724
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,920
Will you say it or not?

725
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,230
Hua.

726
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,190
A few days ago,

727
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,360
someone found you

728
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,920
and gave you a sum of money.

729
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,320
You are ordered to wait here today
for Marquis Jingting.

730
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,760
This matter is extremely confidential.

731
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,400
Only you and the other person know it.

732
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,550
Don’t act sophisticated.
You won’t get a word from me.

733
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,360
Normally,

734
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,280
there shouldn’t be
a third person who knows it.

735
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,630
But why does Princess Ban

736
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,190
know something would happen today?

737
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,110
Why did she come to
the restaurant early,

738
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,920
saved him and arrested you?

739
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,150
I don’t know.

740
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,360
Yeah, it feels strange.

741
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360
Could it be...

742
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Could it be that the other person

743
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,510
wants to sacrifice you long ago?

744
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,920
It’s impossible.

745
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,070
Shi Feixian won’t sell me out.

746
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,710
Shi Feixian?

747
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,440
Don’t you dare to smear other people!

748
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,550
Let me ask you again.

749
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,110
Who asked you to do it?

750
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,190
I have a pearl on me.

751
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,550
Shi Feixian gave it to me.

752
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,030
If you don’t believe me,
just take a look by yourself.

753
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,180
<i>Qi Rouge Store</i>

754
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,800
<i>Qi Rouge Store</i>
Clean up that place.

755
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,670
Okay.

756
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,320
Sir!

757
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,550
Princess Ban, inside, please.

758
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,840
I’m not here to buy jewelry today.

759
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,230
Do you recognize this pearl?

760
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,510
Yes.

761
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,360
This is the Southern Pearl from Yuezhou.

762
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,000
Only my store sells such pearls
in the whole capital.

763
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Do you still remember
who you sold it to?

764
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,480
I only got four pearls in total.

765
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,230
There are still two in the store.

766
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,280
The other two pearls...

767
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,360
Did you sell them to the Shi family?

768
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,510
Your Grace, how do you know it?

769
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,300
<i>Shi’s Mansion</i>

770
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,710
Hua.

771
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,880
It’s a felony to break in Shi’s mansion.

772
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,400
Of course I know.

773
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,630
I just want to commit a felony.

774
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,030
Hua, I understand your feelings.

775
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,550
But you can’t act on impulse.

776
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,510
Your Grace, I’m not acting on impulse.

777
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,630
We can’t find out the truth

778
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,670
just by the words of a bandit
and some pearls.

779
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,070
It this matter ends up unclear,

780
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,710
then tomorrow,

781
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,320
this flowerpot may fall on my head,

782
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,360
<i>Shi’s Mansion</i>
on Heng’s head and my mother’s head.

783
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,590
Therefore,

784
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,510
I have to break in Shi’s Mansion today.

785
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,280
I will make a big scene,

786
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,800
so big that His Majesty
has to look into it.

787
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,800
I know.

788
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,760
Go ahead and do it.

789
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,400
I’ll take care of the rest of it.

790
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,000
Minister, Ban Huai was attacked today.

791
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,480
Marquis Jingting’ Mansion
should have no time

792
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,800
to care about Qizhou for some time.

793
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,190
As long as Zhao Shunzi
is still at Ban family,

794
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,150
they will get the letter
written in blood one day.

795
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,360
We still need to prepare ourselves.

796
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,110
We can’t wait for
the Ban family to make a move.

797
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,760
Yes.

798
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,510
Shi Feixian, get out!

799
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,630
Princess Ban.

800
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,230
It’s a felony to break into
Prime Minister’s mansion.

801
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,230
Please go back.

802
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,030
Ban Hua?

803
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,230
What ungraceful things
did the Shi family do?

804
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,360
Why are you so afraid of letting me in?

805
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,960
Today,

806
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,960
I’m going to turn
your mansion upside down!

807
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,320
You dare not admit what you did.

808
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,960
Is that all what the Shi family can do?

809
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,440
Minister, could it be about the letter?

810
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,800
Why do you panic?
We’ll bridge over the troubled water.

811
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,510
She is just a young woman.

812
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,230
Look how panicked you are.

813
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,320
Princess Ban, why do you

814
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,760
suddenly come here?

815
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,670
My father was attacked
on the street today.

816
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,360
I’m here to ask for an explanation.

817
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,400
Marquis Jingting was attacked?

818
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,670
Is he all right?

819
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,320
If you want to ask for an explanation,

820
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,360
you should report it to the government.

821
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,030
Why do you come to my place?

822
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,880
Because Shi Feixian did it!

823
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,550
If I can’t meet Shi Feixian today,

824
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,590
no one can make me go back!

825
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,110
That’s ridiculous!

826
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,660
<i>Shi’s Mansion</i>

827
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,110
Stop, who are you?

828
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,000
<i>Court of Judicial Review</i>

829
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,150
<i>Court of Judicial Review</i>
Court of Judicial Review is under order

830
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,880
to investigate a case.
Unrelated people should step aside.

831
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
Your Grace, if you make such a visit,

832
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,320
there will no room for mediation

833
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,280
between you and Prime Minister Shi.

834
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,030
Mr. Liu, rest assured.

835
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,440
I know what I’m doing.

836
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,480
I’ll bear all the blame today.

Jin.

840
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,960
It concerns the Shi family’s reputation.

841
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,670
There is no place for you to speak.

842
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,800
There must be some misunderstanding.

843
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,670
Just ask Shi Feixian to come out

844
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
and we will know
if there is any misunderstanding.

845
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,550
Your Shi family

846
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,760
had the balls to do it,

847
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,630
why are you afraid to admit it?

848
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,800
Princess Ban, you’re used to
running wild in the capital.

849
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,110
It seems like no one
can control you now.

850
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,110
You broke into my mansion today

851
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,110
and want to arraign my granddaughter.

852
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,150
Who gives you the power?
