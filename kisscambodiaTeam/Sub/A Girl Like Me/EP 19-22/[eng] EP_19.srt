00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,020
Of course.

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,500

45
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,900

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,500
-Doomed. Doomed.
-How many times have you kissed?

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,100
All right. All right.

00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,900
It should be simple, but also...

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,260
Dazzling!

63
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,460
Your Grace, it’s Prince Luo’s wedding.

64
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,940
But you want a dazzling dress.

65
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,260
Are you going to make trouble?

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,460
I just want to see

67
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,460
if the thing I dreamed of

Yeah.

71
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,340
It’s not a coincidence.

72
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,260
He waited for you for an hour.

73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,260

enough sleep last night?

00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,500

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,260
Would you like to have some?

78
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,100
I’m not tired, sleepy, or hungry.

79
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,300

Why don’t you help her?

84

Young Master.

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,540
Miss Softy can carry something
ten times as heavy as me.

86
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,300
I don’t think she needs help.

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,740

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,980

105
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,740
if I should marry him.

110
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,740
You all look beautiful.

111
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,260
I’m happy to see that.

112
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,220
Good girl.

113
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,900
This is what I used when I got married.

114
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,180
I’m giving it to you as a present.

115
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,780
Do you like it?

116
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,540
Thank you, Your Highness. I like it.

117
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,380
My son

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,220
can be a bit irritable.

119
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,020
But he’s a good man.

120
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,020
If you feel aggrieved,

121
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,620
come to me.

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
I’ll certainly help you.

Second, bow to parents!

As Princess, she’ll enjoy the offering
from two hundred counties.

133
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,980
We put this down in paper
to show the heaven

134
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,660
so that their marriage

135
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,740
will be recorded

136
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,500

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,980

I like to show off, so what?

144
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,420
I’ll piss you off! Piss you off!

145
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,180
Suyue, the wine tastes sweet.

146
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,020
Have a try.

147
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Your Highness, I don’t drink wine.

154
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,660

159
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,940
Nothing.

160
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,980
My hand is wounded
when practicing archery

161
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,860
and I can hardly help myself
to the food.

162
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,060
If you don’t like it,

163
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,620
forget it.

164
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,140

165
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,140
Aunt has picked the right man.

166
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,900
A young man and a young girl like them

167
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,460
make such a perfect match.

168
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,260
The food you fed me tastes better.

169
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,700
My daughter is getting married next.

170
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,460

177
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,820
Minister Shi, I remember

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,460
you have another daughter

179
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,340
except the Crown Princess.

180
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,620
I wonder if she’s engaged.

181
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,420
Thanks for the concern, Your Highness.

182
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,300
My granddaughter Shi Feixian
isn’t engaged yet.

183
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,100
The Crown Princess is known
to be virtuous.

184
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,740
Your other granddaughter
must be good, too.

185
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,980
Minister Shi.

186
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,140
I want to be a matchmaker for her.

187
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,340
Would you like that?

188
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,580
Since you bring it up,

189
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,020
I’d certainly like it.

190
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,580
I wonder which young man you mean.

191
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,340
You’ve made the trouble, son.

192
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,660
I have to make up for it.

193
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,580
The second son of the Xie family

194
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,980
is handsome, talented, and virtuous.

195
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,700
I think

196
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,740
they’ll make a perfect match.

197
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,540
Xie Qilin?

198
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,940
Isn’t he a blind man?

199
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

200
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,380
We’re grateful to you.

201
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Your Highness, you have good taste!

202
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,860
My second son is excellent.

203
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,980
He’s a perfect match for Miss Shi!

204
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,580
He’ll be a very good husband!

205
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,220
Your Highness!

206
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,020
Your Highness, I...

207
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,020
Your Highness.

208
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,420
Sorry, but I can’t do it.

209
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,140
Thank you for your favor.

210
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,940
But I’ve missed the girl

211
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,180
I want to marry most.

212
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,420
Now,

213
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,580
I don’t want to get married.

214
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,540
Please take back your order!

215
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,460
Xie Qilin.

216
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,100
Do you think Miss Shi isn’t good enough

217
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,700
to be your wife?

218
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,420
No. She’s a good girl.

219
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,020
She’s from a famous family

220
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,380
and she’s good at literature.

221
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,100
Many young men adore her.

222
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,380
But...

223
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,140
She isn’t the girl I adore.

224
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,540
However excellent she is,

225
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,180
she’s a normal girl

226
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,820
to me.

227
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,420
Who does Xie Qilin refer to?

228
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,820
Could it be Princess Ban?

229
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,860
Shi Feixian is the most talented girl

230
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,340
in our nation.

231
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,180
But even a blind man doesn’t want
to marry her.

232
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,540
Your son is more sensible than you.

233
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,860
Fine. Fine.

234
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,820
The Empress was just kidding.

235
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,100
Xie Qilin, since you adore someone,

236
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,980
you can ask me to get you married.

237
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,780
Everyone in the Xie family is loyal.

238
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,660
I’ll always satisfy them.

239
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,700
Come on. Let’s cheers.

240
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,260
Ban Hua, stop!

241
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,820
You promised me

242
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,460
you wouldn’t tell anyone about the thing

243
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,220
between Prince Luo and me.

244
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,180
But today,

245
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,940
you stirred up trouble
in front of the Empress

246
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,620
on Prince Luo’s wedding.

247
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,980
I’m not you.

248
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,300
I don’t need to do that.

249
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
Stop quibbling!

250
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,820
If you didn’t,

251
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,820
who else could have framed me up?

252
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,660
You already have Count Cheng’an.

253
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,740
Why can’t you let go of me?

254
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,940
Can’t you be satisfied

255
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,300
until you destroy my life
with a blind man?

256
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,860
Would you cut it out?

257
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,860
Like I said,

258
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,500
I didn’t tell anyone about your affair.

259
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
If you didn’t,

260
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,700
go explain to the Empress

261
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,180
that Blind Xie Qilin likes you

262
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,580
and you should marry him.

263
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,420
Shi Feixian, stop calling him blind!

264
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
He was blind because of you!

265
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,140
Watch your tongue!

266
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,460
Your Grace.

267
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,220
I know you’re jealous of me.

268
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,500
That’s why you always frame me up.

269
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,860
But now,

270
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,980
why are you still slandering me?

271
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,060
Do you have to kill me

272
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,140
to be satisfied?

273
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,420
Enough.

274
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,020
No one else is here.

275
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,500
Stop pretending, all right?

276
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,500
Stop being a drama queen

277
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,220
in front of me!

278
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,300
You disgust me.

279
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,740
I don’t like Xie Qilin.

280
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,940
But I think highly of him.

281
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,980
Luckily, he refused to marry you today.

282
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,020
Otherwise,

283
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
it would be bad luck
to the Xie family

284
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,380
if you marry him.

285
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,460
What a filthy speech!

286
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,140
Why does Count Cheng’an adore
such a rude girl like you?

287
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,860
You know what?

288
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,500
Count Cheng’an already knew

289
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,540
what kind of girl I was.

290
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,820
But he still likes me.

291
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,980
What can you do about that?

292
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,060
I’ve never lost to you.

293
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,980
I’ll never give up, either.

294
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,900
Well, keep watching our love, then.

295
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,780
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

296
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,340
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>
Your Grace, I’m home.

297
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,220
You can go back now.

298
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,300
Hua, it’s such a cold night.

299
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,980
Don’t you invite me in for some hot tea?

300
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,740
It’s a warm night, I think.

301
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,020
Besides,

302
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,820
you have hot tea at home.

303
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,980
When you go back,

304
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,300
ask Mr. Shi to make tea for you.

305
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,500
Hua.

306
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,900
What wrong have I done today?

307
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,220
Nothing.

308
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,260
Did I behave

309
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,780
very badly

310
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,220
so that people complained about you?

311
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,340
No one complained about me.

312
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,740
But many girls are jealous of me.

313
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,500
I saw the Crown Prince

314
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,020
do this to his wife.

315
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,420
I thought you would like it.

316
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,940
Don’t worry, Hua.

317
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,980
I’m sorry for what I did today.

318
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,540
I won’t do that anymore.

319
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,660
I like that.

320
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,100
Keep doing that.

321
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,980
Anyway, I’m used to it
when people are jealous of me.

322
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,260
Your Highness.

323
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,980
Get out!

324
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,180
Hurry!

325
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,380
How dare you stare at me like that!

326
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,100
Jiang Luo, what’s this?

327
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,260
Xie Wanyu.

328
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,980
How dare you break into my study!

329
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,020
Did you make Mother want

330
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
to marry Shi Feixian to someone?

331
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,540
Am I so bad

332
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,900
in your eyes?

333
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,500
Why did you marry me

334
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,220
if you didn’t want to?

335
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,700
Funny.

336
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,780
Your family insisted
on marrying you to me.

337
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,500
Do you think
I really wanted to marry you?

338
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,340
Well,

339
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,900
let’s divorce, then.

340
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,860
I don’t want to be your wife!

341
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,620
Xie Wanyu.

342
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,820
No one dares to talk to me like this!

343
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,340
Don’t think I don’t dare to kill you.

344
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,900
Your family is only my dog!

345
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,900
<i>South Gate</i>

346
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,140
How dare you punch my man!

347
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,460
He’s the man I want to punch.

348
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,220
I punched you to avenge you

349
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,740
for taking away my beloved girl.

350
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,180
Hua, I’m leaving.

351
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,260
I don’t know

352
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,220
when I can come back.

353
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,180
If you have something to tell me,

354
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,500
just say it.

355
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,300
Well, I do have something to tell you.

356
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,060
Have a nice trip.

357
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,020
Don’t you feel sad at all?

358
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,420
All good things will come to an end.

359
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,860
Even if she doesn’t want you to go,

360
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,860
you’d better leave early.

361
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,940
After all, you’ve stayed for months.

362
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,500
If I didn’t know
what kind of man you were,

363
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,940
I would suspect your purpose.

364
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,580
You’re a scheming man.

365
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,060
I can’t outargue you.

366
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,660
But remember.

367
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,620
If you’re rude to Hua,

368
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,980
I’ll come back with my army
and deal with you!

369
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,420
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

370
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,940
I’ll be nice to her

371
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,660
and never let her feel aggrieved.

372
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,820
But Your Highness,
I’d like to remind you.

373
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,540
Your army can’t come to the capital.

374
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,460
You can’t even reach the border.

375
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,300
People in your nation are so sly.

376
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,340
All right.

377
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,900
Don’t worry, man.

378
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,380
You’re my friend.

379
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,820
Here.

380
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,980
Seems like I don’t have a chance.

381
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,180
But it’s okay.

382
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,660
I have a good friend at least.

383
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,500
Hua, if you leave your nation someday,

384
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,380
remember to see me in Aipo State.

385
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,400
Mm.

386
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,020
Your Majesty.

387
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,500
The assassin who killed Princess Royal

388
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,380
was hidden deep.

389
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,700
It’s hard to figure out the man
behind the killing.

390
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,340
After a long investigation,

391
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,900
I’ve got nothing.

392
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,820
I owe my aunt a great debt of gratitude

393
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,500
and I fail to pay her back.

394
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,060
If I can’t find out the murderer,

395
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,820
I won’t feel relieved.

396
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,540
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.
Please punish me.

397
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,820
But...

398
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,660
I have a guess.

399
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,620
I wonder if I should tell you.

400
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,340
You’re always good at judging things.

401
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,900
Feel free to tell me.

402
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,980
Many powerful clans

403
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,620
raise private soldiers.

404
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,900
But such a well-trained assassin...

405
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,180
I’m afraid

406
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,220
he has something to do
with the resentment of predecessors.

407
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,060
How dare you!

408
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,940
Don’t talk nonsense!

409
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,540
Stop investigating the case.

410
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,180
Leave me.

Surprisingly, you’re not only
a good scholar,

413
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,300
but also good at archery.

414
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,380
It’s been only a few days,

415
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,780
and you can already shoot
whatever you want.

416
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,100
With a good teacher,
I get double results with half the work.

417
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,340
I’m doing good,

418
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,780
because you teach me well.

419
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,500
You’re right.

420
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,700
But...

421
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,740
people practice differently.

422
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,860
Look at Ban Heng.

423
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,980
I taught him so well,
but he still couldn’t learn it.

424
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,860
Anyway, it’s clever of you.

425
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,180
Officer. Officer.

426
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,980
Please let us pass.

427
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,660
-We’re refugees.
-What’s happening?

428
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,820
We’re fleeing from calamity.

429
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,580
How dare you!

430
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,180
Hua.

431
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,860
How dare you

432
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,300
walk on the government-financed road!

433
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,620
Please spare us, Officer.

434
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,220
We’ve never come to the capital before.

435
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,660
We didn’t know anything
about government-financed roads.

436
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,460
Please show some mercy

437
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,620
and let us pass.

438
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you think you can come to the capital

439
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,860
just as you wish?

440
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,900
Arrest them!

441
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,180
Don’t touch my grandmother!

442
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,780
Come here.

443
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,220
You brat! I...

444
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,300
Bully others?

445
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,380
Let me teach you a lesson today!

446
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,060
Your... Your Grace?

447
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,340
Boy, hold your grandmother

448
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,540
and come with me.

449
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,780
What is going on?

450
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,700
Looks like she’s too hungry.

451
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,220
We haven’t had anything to eat for days.

452
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,540
Many people died of hunger.

453
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,180
Miss.

454
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,460
Madam.

455
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,900
My grandson was born in a good family
in Qizhou.

456
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,820
His parents were killed by villains.

457
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,740
Please take care of him.

458
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,500
I’ll pay you back in my next life.

459
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,940
Grandmother, wake up!

460
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,340
Grandmother!

461
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,860
Grandmother!

462
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,420
Come over.

463
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,660
From now on,

464
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,620
this is your room.

465
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,940
If you need anything,

466
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,460
tell me.

467
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,900
Thank you, Miss.

468
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,180
This is the amulet Mother gave me.

469
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,620
It’s such an important thing.

470
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,700
Keep it carefully.

471
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,020
My mother said

472
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,620
the amulet is for a good person.

473
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,060
You’re a good person.

474
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,620
Fine. I can take it.

475
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,860
But you must have something to eat.

476
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,540
I’m not hungry.

477
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,780
Come.

478
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,820
I’m not hungry.

479
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,220
Shunzi, your grandmother wants you

480
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
to grow into a real man.

481
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,540
Whatever happens,

482
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,500
you must face it bravely.

483
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,700
But now, you don’t even eat.

484
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,140
What kind of man will you be?

485
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,500
You like this?

486
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,060
Eat it.

487
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,500
Good boy.

488
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,340
Hua.

489
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,140
What’s on your mind?

490
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,100
I’m thinking.

491
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,980
We have enough food to eat.

492
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,740
But what can those hungry people eat

493
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,780
outside of the capital city?

494
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,100
In fact,

495
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,140
people in Xuezhou, Qizhou and Zhongzhou

496
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,780
have had nothing to eat

497
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,060
for quite a long time.

498
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,580
Didn’t His Majesty know?

499
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,780
He did.

500
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,540
He granted hundreds of dan of grains.

501
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,660
Where have the grains been?

502
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,060
Officials sell posts
and embezzle the grains.

503
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,060
After that,

504
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,460
people will get few grains

505
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,780
even if His Majesty grants
a thousand dan.

506
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,500
Famine outside the capital city

507
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,780
can’t be solved with money only.

508
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,700
But I not only have money.

509
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,180
I also have you.

510
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,500
If we join hands,

511
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,020
we can do something.

512
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,460
Grandfather.

513
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,620
I hear many people in Qizhou
died of hunger

514
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,860
and their condition was horrible.

515
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,740
Yeah.

516
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
May I ask

517
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,700
if the famine

518
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,940
has anything to do with our family?

519
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,060
It’s a natural disaster.

520
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,820
Why does it have anything to do
with our family?

521
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,220
But the magistrate of Qizhou
is your disciple.

522
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,780
Many of our clansmen
also work in Qizhou.

523
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,580
I fear some of them did evil things

524
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,060
and ruined our reputation.

525
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,380
Jin, don’t worry.

526
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,420
If someone dares to ruin our reputation,

527
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,420
I will make a thorough investigation
and never condone them.

528
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,980
You have hard work, Grandfather.

529
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,780
Get back to your business.

530
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,100
Even my grandson suspects this.

531
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,420
I’m afraid other officials are waiting

532
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,980
to find out my mistake.

533
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,740
Don’t worry, Minister Shi.

534
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,340
Official Zhao of Qizhou and his wife
have died in a fire.

535
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,140
No matter who investigates the case,

536
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,180
he’ll find them burnt themselves.

537
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
But I hear

538
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,260
before Official Zhao died,

539
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,980
he left a letter to His Majesty

540
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,780
written in his blood.

541
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,820
His mother and son disappeared.

542
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,940
I’m afraid they have the letter.

543
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,620
Letter written in his blood?

544
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,260
Yes.

545
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,900
What is the letter about?

546
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,540
I’m afraid it’s about something

547
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,180
we mustn’t let His Majesty know.

548
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,900
Send men to get the letter

549
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,820
and don’t leave any trouble.

550
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,420
Aye.

551
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,620
What have you got about Qizhou?

552
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,140
The magistrate Official Zhao
was dismissed a month ago.

553
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,900
A new official took his place
the next day.

554
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,180
Three days later,

555
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,740
Official Zhao and his wife
burned themselves in their home.

556
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,980
Burned themselves?

557
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Did he suicide because he was dismissed?

558
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,660
He had a mother and a son.

559
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,180
But he died with his wife.

560
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,300
Sounds very weird.

561
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,180
Nearly all officials in Qizhou

562
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,220
were promoted by Minister Shi.

563
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,780
So was this new magistrate.

564
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,660
You mean

565
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,460
this is concerning Minister Shi?

566
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,340
Yes.

567
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,140
Shall we destroy Shi Chonghai

568
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,540
with this case?

569
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,500
We must figure out this case
for both private and public purposes.

570
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,460
Give me some.

571
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,140
It’s for everyone! Everyone!

572
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,980
It’s for everyone! Don’t push!

573
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,540
Don’t push!

574
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,420
<i>Ban</i>

575
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,660
Don’t push! It’s for everyone!

576
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,260
Don’t push! Don’t push!

577
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
Kind men!

578
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
It’s for everyone!

579
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,780
Don’t push! I asked you not to push!

580
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,380
Her Grace said

581
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,780
<i>Ban</i>
there would be enough porridge.

582
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,140
<i>Ban</i>

583
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,460
<i>Ban</i>
If anyone makes trouble,

584
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
he’ll be sorry!

585
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,100
He’ll be sorry! Line up!

586
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,540
I came first.

587
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,540
Leave it to me. Go keep the order.

588
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,180
Okay.

589
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,100
Come on. We have enough porridge.

590
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,940
You must be exhausted
after the long trip.

591
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,180
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

592
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,340
When you finish the porridge,

593
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,020
you can have a rest
in the inn across the street.

594
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,380
Come one by one.

595
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,380
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

596
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,380
Come one by one.

597
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,260
Sir.

598
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,500
We’re regular customers.

599
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,900
How dare you fool me!

600
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,940
It’s so unkind of you!

601
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,860
I don’t dare to fool you,
Young Master Ban!

602
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,620
Zhou Changxiao,
show him the account book.

603
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Okay.

604
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,700
Look.

605
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,220
How much is the accommodation fee?
49 taels and a half.

606
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,260
How much did I give you? Fifty.

607
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,060
What about the other half tael?

608
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,260
See?

609
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,300
He and I

610
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
recorded every penny used.

611
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,940
But, uh...

612
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,220
Young Master.

613
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,980
Isn’t it our old rule?

614
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,340
The rest is our tip.

615
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,980
Tip?

616
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,940
The half tael is enough
for a pot of porridge.

617
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,900
Give it back to me!

618
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,180
But...

619
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,900
Such little money

620
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,900
isn’t even enough for your liquor.

621
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,620
Why are you suddenly

622
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
so tight-fisted?

623
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,220
This is different.

624
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,380
My sister said

625
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,820
such money was special.

626
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,380
Every penny is the life-saving money
for disaster relief.

627
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,340
Every penny should be used

628
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
on all refugees.

629
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,660
Fine. Fine.

630
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,820
<i>Ban</i>
Take it.

631
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,500
<i>Ban</i>
It’s my turn. Give me some.

632
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,780
Princess Ban is beautiful and kind.

633
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,580
She’s just like
a kindhearted Bodhisattva.

634
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,260
Yeah.

635
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,620
Princess Ban is as great

636
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,180
as Princess Royal!

637
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,900
Precisely.

638
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,020
-Thank you, Your Grace.
-Thank you, Your Grace.

639
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,100
Come on.

640
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,020
Her shed looks dirty and messy.

641
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,060
How can refugees eat without concern?

642
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,860
Come on. Take it.

643
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,540
Here. Take it.

644
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,460
Thank you.

645
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,180
-Here. This is for you.
-Thank you.

646
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,060
Enjoy it.

647
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,340
Shi Feixian?

648
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,580
With a beautiful condition and music,

649
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,580
refugees can relax and stop worrying.

650
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,380
Ban Hua, you won’t understand.

651
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,300
What is she doing?

652
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,340
I don’t know. We don’t understand.

653
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,140
It’s hot. Be careful.

654
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,100
-Thank you.
-Come on.

655
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,060

Come and get the porridge.

656
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,580
It’s for everyone.

657

Thank you. Thank you, Your Grace.

658
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,620
Thank you, Your Grace.

659
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,300
It’s hot. Be careful.

00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,660
Come on. Take it.

661
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,140
It’s for everyone. Don’t be anxious.

662
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,740
Come on.

663
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,580
I’ll give better food.
They’ll all come to mine.

00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,980
Free roast chicken from the Shi family!

Come and get it, everyone!

00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,100
Free roast chicken for everyone!

00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,180
Roast chicken?

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,460
Free roast chicken!

678
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,140
Free roast chicken for so many refugees?

679
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,060
The Shi family can be so rich!

680
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,500
They’re not rich.

681
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
They’re being stupid!

00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,420
Make way.

00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,980
You have a hard day, Your Grace.

685
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,620
Would you like a drumstick?

686
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,740
Shi Feixian, what are you doing?

687
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,780
You’re angry, Your Grace?

688
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,140
I just think they’ve been hungry

689
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,140
and have no meat to eat

690
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,100
and I want to provide them
with something better.

691
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,940
I didn’t expect to annoy you.

692
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,900
Don’t pretend

693
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,500
to be a kind girl, all right?

694
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,540
To relieve the people,
we should give enough food

695
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,860
so that more people will
have something to eat!

696
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,180
If you do this, there’ll be trouble.

697
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,740
It’s silly of me.

698
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,780
I just worry if the refugees
will have enough food to eat.

699
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,700
I wonder what wrong I’ve done.

700
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,340
Uh...

701
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,900
Miss Shi is kindhearted.
She has done nothing wrong.

702
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,540
But...

703
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,220
Yeah.

704
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,740
Yeah, she gives porridge,

705
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,060
but doesn’t want the Shi family
to give roast chicken.

706
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,260
Her family is rich, but she’s so stingy.

707
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,900
What are you talking about?

708
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,260
What are you talking about? Shut up!

709
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,420
Say no more!

710
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,540
Shut up!

711
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,900
My family isn’t as rich
as yours, Your Grace.

712
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,180
But I also want to help
as much as I can.

713
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,380
Your Grace, let’s work together

714
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,180
to help people get over the difficulty.

715
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,620
Shi... Shi Feixian, you!

716
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,540
Your Grace. Your Grace.

717
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,300
Hua.

718
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,460
Miss Shi and Princess Ban
both consider for refugees.

719
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,980
They’re both doing charity.

720
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
But she shouldn’t run wild!

721
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,860
Yeah!

722
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,340
You’re right, Your Grace.

723
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,260
I was narrow-minded.

724
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,180
Well, Miss Shi,

725
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,340
I’d like to thank you
on behalf of the refugees.

726
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,380
Everybody, do you have anything
to report to me?

727
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,180
Your Majesty,

728
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,220
people in Qizhou have nothing to eat.

729
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,540
Refugees are everywhere.

730
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,500
The magistrate of Qizhou suddenly died
after being dismissed.

731
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,620
The new magistrate took office

732
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,460
against the rule.

733
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,700
The problem in Qizhou

734
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,260
isn’t natural disaster,
but man-caused problem.

735
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,500
His Majesty cares about the problem
in Qizhou.

736
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,540
Count Cheng’an,
why did you talk nonsense?

737
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,660
Your Majesty, I have something
to report.

738
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,740
This is the account book for Qizhou

739
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,620
and the letter to appoint
the new magistrate.

740
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,260
<i>Account Book</i>

741
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,060
Two days ago,

742
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,580
the new magistrate
sent hundreds of taels of silver

743
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,500
to some official.

744
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,180
Then he took the post.

745
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,180
The new magistrate

746
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,820
bought his post from a minister

747
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,260
who has jurisdiction over Qizhou.

748
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,100
Count Cheng’an!

749
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,740
How dare you talk nonsense
in front of His Majesty!

750
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,540
Your Majesty.

751
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,500
The famine in Qizhou has lasted
for over one month.

752
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,340
You granted grains and money
for disaster relief.

753
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
If the magistrate of Qizhou
didn’t embezzle them,

754
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,180
the problem wouldn’t be so serious.

755
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,940
If senior officials didn’t shield him
and he wasn’t scared,

756
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,860
how would so many grains

757
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,620
be gone?

758
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,780
Minister Xie, what do you think of it?

759
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,900
Your Majesty, I...

760
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,100
Just say it.

761
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,820
I think we should handle it carefully.

762
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,860
These are wasted words.

763
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,780
What do you think, Ban Huai?

764
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,980
Your Majesty.

765
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,380
This is a very important problem.

766
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,060
We’d better be very careful.

767
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,740
Aren’t these wasted words, too?

768
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,460
Shut up!

769
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,660
Minister Shi.

770
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,940
Tell me what you think.

771
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,460
Your Majesty, Count Cheng’an is right.

772
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,660
I have something to do
with the problem in Qizhou.

773
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,620
I recommended the magistrate of Qizhou.

774
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,060
Why did I recommend him?

775
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,940
Because he’s a disciple
of Count Cheng’an’s father.

776
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,060
I didn’t accept any of his money.

777
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,460
I used it to buy food
and give it to the refugees.

778
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,820
Please kindly check, Your Majesty.

779
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,780
<i>Memorial to the Throne</i>

780
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,020
What a coincidence!

781
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,100
This morning, Princess Fule wrote
a memorial to the throne

782
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,700
about your family.

783
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,940
Your Majesty, don’t listen to a girl.

784
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,860
How can girls handle political affairs?

785
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,660
Who told you
girls couldn’t handle political affairs?

786
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,380
When my mother
handled political affairs,

787
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,980
you didn’t even enter
for the imperial examination!

788
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,060
<i>Memorial to the Throne</i>
In the memorial to the throne,

789
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,580
Princess Fule put in a good word
for your family.

790
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,460
What are you worried about?

791
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,300
<i>Memorial to the Throne</i>
The Shi family cared for refugees

792
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,220
and bought roast chicken for them.

793
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,300
I’m writing to request you
to award them.

794
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,300
Is that true?

795
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,220
It’s true, Your Majesty.

796
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,020
Minister Shi.

797
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,620
You’re really the pillar of our nation.

798
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,140
I feel so relieved.

799
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,620
I’ll encourage such good deeds!

800
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,860
Come and get the decree, Minister Shi.

801
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,780
Aye.

802
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,180
From today on,

803
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,580
you should buy roast chicken
for refugees.

804
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,540
Do it every day within a month.

805
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,380
Aye, Your Majesty.

806
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,940
Don’t pretend to be wealthy.

807
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,660
Roast chicken for a month
will dissipate your fortune!

808
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,940
Count Cheng’an, come and get the decree.

809
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,740
Aye.

810
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,980
I’m making you Minister of Revenue

811
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,380
to investigate the case of Qizhou!

812
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,180
I won’t let you down, Your Majesty!
