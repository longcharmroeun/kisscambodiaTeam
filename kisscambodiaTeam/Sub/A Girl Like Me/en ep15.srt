1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,039
Who is it?

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:07,440
It's me.

3
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,239
Why are you here?

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,440
I miss you too much.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,920
So, I came here to see you.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,479
This is for you.

7
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,639
How do you know this place?

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,840
When I first saw you in the game,

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,599
I was here at this building.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,119
I know that you are this company's

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:43,919
CEO.

12
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,919
So, I came here to see you.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,439
You are all wet.

14
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,599
Let me get you something to change into.

15
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,880
This is our company's event T-shirt.

16
00:00:58,959 --> 00:00:59,680
Change into it.

17
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:05,519
I'll wait for you outside.

18
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,919
Sit tight.

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,720
I drive very fast.

20
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,900
(Exit)

21
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,770
=Love Crossed=

22
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,760
=Episode 15=

23
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,200
The city at night is so beautiful.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,200
The rain has stopped?

25
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,759
You love the rain?

26
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
I've seen it in movies before.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,480
How do you feel about the real rain?

28
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,879
It's quite fascinating.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,519
The feeling of it
falling down on my face

30
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,799
is very comforting.

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,959
I like the breeze after the rain.

32
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,959
It's warm and clean when
it breezes on my face.

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,720
I once read a book.

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,039
That book is about

35
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,799
the life after death.

36
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,519
So, how is it like?

37
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
After we die,
everything will stay the same.

38
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,880
But we won't be able to feel

39
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,239
the breeze on our faces again.

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,040
I didn't know how it feels in the past.

41
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,479
But now, I can understand

42
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,799
why humans are so sentimentally
attached to this world.

43
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,560
There are a lot of things that

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,919
people are attached to.

45
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,760
The morning dew on the petals.

46
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,639
The warm sunshine in the afternoon.

47
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,320
The chirping of cicadas in summer.

48
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,799
And the first snow in winter.

49
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,919
You should experience them all.

50
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,799
After hearing that,

51
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,079
you've really piqued my interest.

52
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,840
You are not afraid of
the outside world anymore?

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,440
It's not that I'm afraid.

54
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,880
But compared to fear,

55
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,560
the urge to see you is stronger.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,880
(Kele, you've been asking for)

57
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,720
(a car of your own for a long time.)

58
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
(And I think that)

59
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,120
(it's really inconvenient for you
to take the train to work.)

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,359
(Use the money in this card)

61
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,320
(to buy a car that you like.)

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,140
(Kele)

63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,600
I know. In this situation,

64
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,959
the man should cut the steak
for the woman

65
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,280
and then give it to her.

66
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,679
But I think that you are
different from other women.

67
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,079
You are more independent.

68
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
That's why I ate the steak myself.

69
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,040
Just now, I was still thinking about

70
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,720
how to reject you kindly

71
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,679
if you cut the steak

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,799
and gave it to me.

73
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,199
You've done well.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,239
It's more comfortable to just
eat our own food.

75
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,359
Today

76
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,239
is our first date in the outside world.

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
Can we drink some wine?

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,040
Sure.

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,239
I'll pass.

80
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,600
I'll drink water instead.

81
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,399
I know.

82
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,199
You have to drive, right?

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,399
So, you know about that.

84
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,359
Looks like you'll be able to

85
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,000
adapt to the outside world soon.

86
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,239
So comfortable.

87
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
Is this firm enough?

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,320
Yes,

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,679
can't you be gentler?

90
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,120
Okay.

91
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,199
If you feel sore anywhere,

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,359
tell me about it.

93
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,519
I feel sore everywhere.

94
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,760
Let me massage you more then.

95
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720
Actually, my heart
is the one feeling unwell.

96
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,000
Kele.

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,639
Is something weighing you down again?

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,560
It's because of you.

99
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Let me ask you.

100
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
If your mom is going to pass away,

101
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,840
what will you do?

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,239
I will accompany and

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,519
take care of her all the time.

104
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,880
See? Even you can understand that.

105
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,359
Why can't he understand?

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,720
Are you talking about
the person who looks like me?

107
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,479
Yes. Him.

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,279
When I told him that his mom is sick,

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,440
he scolded me for being a busybody.

110
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't want to get involved anymore.

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,679
But my dad came back today.

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,679
And suddenly, I realized something.

113
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,760
You can't leave behind regrets
in your life.

114
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,320
Kele, you are doing something good.

115
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,960
You can't give up
just because you failed once.

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I think you should advise him again.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,560
He'll understand.

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,919
Okay. I'll advise him again then.

119
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,320
But to be honest,

120
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,719
what if he scolds me again?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,359
If he scolds you again,

122
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,560
you can come and scold me.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,080
Then, you'll feel better, right?

124
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,640
If I see him one day,

125
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,880
I'll definitely scold him for you.

126
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,000
I knew it. You are the best.

127
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,060
(Lu Xiao)

128
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,740
(Xu Nian)

129
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,760
This is the first time you see yourself

130
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,320
in the real world, right?

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,799
Is this our images in the game?

132
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,679
Actually, it's not
that different from you.

133
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,400
But you have to know.

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,719
No matter how real

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
the person in the game is,

136
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,679
he's still not the real you.

137
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,279
The real you

138
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,560
should live in the real world.

139
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,460
(Su Lie)

140
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,460
(Luo Ke)

141
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,799
We are here.

142
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,239
When can we meet again?

143
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,599
Will you come to Bay House to find me?

144
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,679
But I'll wait for you

145
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,000
in the office every night.

146
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,239
If you want to see me, come out.

147
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,279
See you tomorrow night then.

148
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,520
I'll show you

149
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,520
more of the outside world
tomorrow night.

150
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,320
Okay. I'll get going now.

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,279
I'll really go now.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Go.

153
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,400
Bye.

154
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,279
Bye.

155
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,880
(There are a lot of things that)

156
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,400

157
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,919

(The warm sunshine in the afternoon.)

159

(The chirping of cicadas in summer.)

160
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,080
(And the first snow in winter.)

161
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,120
(You should experience them all.)

Son!

167
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,440
Wake up, son!

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,919
Son!

169
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,799
He's a jinx.

170
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,760
No wonder no one
is willing to adopt him.

171
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,880
Son!

172
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,200
The dean shouldn't have pitied on him.

173
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,279
Look at her now.

174
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,400
They just recently adopted him

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,159
and her own son is dead because of him.

176
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,120
That's right.

(Family Medical Guide)

178
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,719
What are you doing?

179
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,560
Good morning.

180
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,760
You haven't eaten breakfast, right?

181
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,320
I had.

182
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,640
It's okay.

183
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,000
That breakfast is not good anyway.

184
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,799
Look at what I've brought.

185
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,120
This is only for you.

186
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,320
I don't want to eat it.

187
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,159
Let me tell you.

188
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,000
This is not a normal cake.

189
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,000
This is a birthday cake.

190
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,719
It's not my birthday.

191
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,200
Why do I have to eat this birthday cake?

192
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,159
I know it's not your birthday.

193
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,560
It's not my birthday too.

194
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,039
This one

195
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,080
is my mom's birthday cake.

196
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,159
Didn't I tell you

197
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,039
not to be a busybody?

198
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,719
I'm not being a busybody.

199
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,560
This is really my mom's birthday cake.

200
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,919
Although my mom

201
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,039
passed away when I was very young,

202
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,359
every year,

203
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,719
my dad and I will
celebrate her birthday.

204
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,640
Your mom passed away?

205
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,640
Yes, when I was very young.

206
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,039
Why are you celebrating
her birthday then?

207
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,719
Shouldn't it be her deathday?

208
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
My dad and I

209
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,640
think that deathday is too depressing.

210
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,039
So, every year,

211
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,520
we'll mourn for her.

212
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,359
Every time we celebrate her birthday,

213
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,640
I'll think that

214
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,440
it would be nice if
my mom was still alive.

215
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,919
I really miss her.

216
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,679
So, Lu Xiao, don't be mad at me.

217
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,760
I told you as soon as possible

218
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,320
after I found out that your mom is sick,

219
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,039
because my mom passed away from illness.

220
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,159
I don't want you to have any regrets.

221
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,919
Kele.

222
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,760
Thank you for what you did for me.

223
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,159
But, please don't tell anybody about

224
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,120
my mom being in the nursing home.

225
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,200
For the rest,

226
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,400
let me decide by myself.

227
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,279
So, you are not mad now?

228
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,320
Let's eat some cake then.

229
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay.

230
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,039
Are we still going to film the MV of

231
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,440
"Better to dance than to fall in love"?

232
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,760
Guan Qianya has refused to
be the leading actress.

233
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,400
Of course we do.

234
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,359
Let's just find an actress
who looks like Guan Qianya.

235
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,000
Won't it be against the law?

236
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,880
Guan Qianya has no right to sue me.

237
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:30,359
What I mean is

238
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,000
won't it be a breach of copyright

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of the Love Boys,

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,880
if you dress up as Xu Nian?

241
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,279
Xu Guanghan has even
fewer rights to sue me.

242
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,599
He took away so many of my songs.

243
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,599
So what if I use one of his characters?

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,839
Moreover,

245
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:45,440
it'll attract more attention
if we are going to court.

246
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,039
I just don't understand.

247
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,080
Why do you have to dance

248
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,919
Xu Nian and Guan Qianya's dance?

249
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,719
Is it for the sake of

250
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,320
the theme of
"Better to dance than to fall in love"?

251
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,679
Or is it because you want to
promote yourself with its popularity?

252
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,200
Both.

253
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:01,599
But this is the postmodern art.

254
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:05,679
You don't know anything
about being an artist.

255
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,640
Look at this...

256
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,880
Isn't this place too small

257
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
for Y4's concert?

258
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,719
It's not small. Qi Chuan will be
holding his concert here too.

259
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,199
Qi Chuan?

260
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,040
Then, it's quite small.

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,599
What is he going to do?

262
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,760
A farewell concert?

263
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,559
No.

264
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,719
His first concert for his world tour.

265
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,400
First concert.

266
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,920
So, there'll only be one concert.

267
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,400
It's a farewell concert then.

268
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,800
This is strange.

269
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,719
After he left Yao Inc.,

270
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,079
he can't write new songs anymore.

271
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,959
What songs can he use

272
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,680
to perform in a concert?

273
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,239
Don't be like this.

274
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
Contact them later.

275
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,719
Give them a discount

276
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,760
so that he can still use
his previous songs.

277
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,800
How much is the discount?

278
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,760
Is someone asking us about the price?

279
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,680
Tell them that

280
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,839
it'll be 10 times the market price.

281
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,959
You just got your compensation, right?

282
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,559
I'm sure you can afford it.

283
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Of course I can.

284
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,680
Mr. Xu, are you here today

285
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,880
to give me support before the concert?

286
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,280
I forgot.

287
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
He's here to scout out the place.

288
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,920
He wants to hold a concert for
the four virtual characters, right?

289
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,599
Are you afraid now?

290
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,439
But don't worry.

291
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,959
Our concert date

292
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,239
will be far from yours.

293
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,760
About two months after yours.

294
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,359
First,

295
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,359
we don't want you to jinx us.

296
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,439
Second,

297
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,839
if we hold a concert,

298
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,239
no one will go to yours.

299
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
Mr. Xu.

300
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,599
Our tickets have already been sold out.

301
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,839
But don't worry.

302
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,920
I'll keep one

303
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,479
VVV VIP ticket.

304
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Remember to join us on that day.

305
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
You can keep one for me.

306
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000
But I won't attend it.

307
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,880
Qi Chuan, when have we
sold out all of our tickets?

308
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,839
Moreover,

309
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,359
if it'll cost us 10 times the price to
buy our previous songs,

310
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,920
we'll lose a lot of money.

311
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,719
It's okay.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,599
I can sing
"Better to dance than to fall in love"

313
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,559
for several times.

314
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,120
It'll take up more than 10 minutes.

315
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,800
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

316
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,839
One and two, three, four, five, six...

317
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,439
What's wrong?

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,199
The new game has
additional dance moves now.

319
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,719
And they are so difficult.

320
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
Yes. Even Lu Xiao got it wrong.

321
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,400
Let's practice it for twice more.

322
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,959
And then, we can rest.

323
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,880
No.

324
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,719
I can't dance anymore.

325
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,280
Xu Nian. How about we stop for today?

326
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,880
Okay. We'll do it again tomorrow.

327
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Go back and rest.

328
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,280
Let's go.

329
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,760
Let's go.

330
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,620
(TAILG)

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,239
I never thought that

332
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,680
I'll be buying a motorbike one day.

333
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,900
(New Arrival)

334
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,340
(TAILG)

335
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,239
Miss, are you interested
in the motorbike?

336
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,280
May I ask

337
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,920
is there any promotion for this?

338
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
This is our new arrival.

340
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,280
(TAILG)
One charge can last your 150km.

341
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,599
For now, there's no promotion for it.

342
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,920
Anything on sales?

343
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,079
What about this?

344
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,640
This is our classic motorbike.
It's not on sales as well.

345
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,559
Do you sell second-hand motorbikes then?

346
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,920
TAILG only sells new motorbikes.

347
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,959
We don't sell the second-hand ones

348
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,479
or refurbished ones.

349
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,839
Looks like this is not for me.

350
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,400
Miss.

351
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,520
How about you take a look at this?

352
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,439
This one is on sales.

353
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,559
But this is the last one.

354
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
If you want it,

355
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,680
I can apply for more discounts for you.

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,180

Ms. Guan.

359
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,479
You are still working?

360
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,800
I'm going to stay here
for a little bit longer.

361
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,559
There are files that
I have to go through.

362
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,959
I heard that Mr. Zhang asked you
about the acquisition

363
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,079
but you rejected him.

364
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,160
Why?

365
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,920
We are the ones who founded
Crush On Love.

366
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,239
Even though we are in
a bad position now,

367
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,520
I won't give it up.

368
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,199
I know.

369
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,599
But have you found
another solution to it?

370
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,000
These are the certificates of
my house and my car.

00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,359
Mortgage them for me.

373
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,640
I've calculated it.

374
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:50,640
The mortgage money

375
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,559
will last us a while.

376
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,640
Ms. Guan, you can't do this.

377
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,559
This is everything you have.

378
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,000
If the company survives,

379
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,520
I'll be able to get them back.

380
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
Don't worry. I'll find a solution.

381
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,280
I'll get it done.

382
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,800
(Crush On Love)

383
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,920
Wait, Mr. Cui.

384
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,079
Do you have an iPass card?

385
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,599
No. Ms. Guan.

386
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,000
During the mortgage period,

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
you can still use your car.

388
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,359
You can stay at your house too.

389
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,800
There'll be no changes to your life.

390
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,559
I know.

391
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,800
I need it for something else.

392
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,120
I just topped it up. You can have it.

393
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,559
Thank you.

394
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,640
I'll get going then.

395
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,620
(Crush On Love)

396
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,500
(iPass)

397
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,479
What happened?
Why is the electricity off again?

398
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,520
Don't panic.

399
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,559
I'll look for the emergency light.

400
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,479
Hurry up.

401
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,760
Who is it?

402
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,120
Jiang Kele!

403
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,559
Be careful!

404
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,599
It's dark. Be careful!

405
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Who went out just now?

406
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,760
Jiang Kele. Look.

407
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,959
Jiang Kele?

408
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,239
When did she become so tall?

409
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,520
What do you mean?

410
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,199
That person is not Jiang Kele!

411
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,199
Why are you still standing here?
Chase after him!

412
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,520
Stop right there!

413
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,640
I'll make sure that
you have no songs to sing.

414
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
You'll have to sing one song on repeat.

415
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,079
Hello? What is it?

416
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,160
What?

417
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,160
Fix it now!

418
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,079
What's wrong?

419
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,880
The Maintenance Department said that
Bay House is suddenly out of power.

420
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,800
They are fixing it now.

421
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,920
What are they doing?

422
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Why is it out of power again?

423
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,640
Can they fix this issue already?

424
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,839
Why do you stop?
We have to go back to Bay House.

425
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,079
Mr. Xu, it's a red light.

426
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,599
Riding on my lovely motorbike.

427
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,239
I won't be stuck in a jam anymore.

428
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,319
Where's my helmet?

429
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,920
Did I leave it in Bay House?

430
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,599
No. I have to go back to take it.

431
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,880
Or else, I'll be doomed.

432
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,000
He's running at night with a helmet.

433
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,760
So dramatic.

434
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,239
Isn't that my helmet?

435
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,400
Who are you?
Why did you steal my helmet?

436
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,559
It's me, Kele.

437
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,760
Who are you?

438
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,079
I'm Lu Xiao!

439
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:07,040
Lu Xiao, why are you out here?

440
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,000
No time to explain. Let's go now.

441
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,359
Stop right there!

442
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,760
Bro!

443
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,760
Stop right there!

444
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,880
Stop right there!

445
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
Did you escape to go to the hospital?

446
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,439
Yes! Speed up!

447
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,640
Okay. I'm speeding up now.

448
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,380
(TAILG)

449
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,239
Hold on to me.

450
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,559
Can you hold on to me properly?

451
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,040
Mr. Xu, we've restored the power.

452
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,839
Where are the security guards?

453
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
Someone sneaked out just now.

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So, they chased after him.

455
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,760
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

456
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Where are the other three?

457
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,920
They are resting in their rooms
because they are too tired from dancing.

458
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,280
Ask them to come out.

459
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,439
Wait.

460
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,520
Go and get the other two.

461
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,880
I'll go and get Lu Xiao.

462
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,920
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

463
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,239
Get out.
I have something to ask all of you.

464
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,839
Who sneaked out when
the power went off just now?

465
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,680
The power went off just now?

466
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,680
Yes.

467
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,280
I didn't know because I fell asleep.

468
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,800
Why would the power go off suddenly?

469
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,800
Shut up.

470
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,079
Xu Nian, tell me.

471
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,120
Who sneaked out just now?

472
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,839
You are the one who
sneaked out just now, right?

473
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,640
Keep it a secret for me.

474
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,800
Nobody went out.

475
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,199
I think you know
the consequences of lying.

476
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,719
I'll ask you again.

477
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,880
Who sneaked out when
the power went off just now?

478
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,680
Nobody.

479
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,520
I was watching a movie
in the living room just now.

480
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,920
They were resting in their rooms.

481
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,319
And the power went off suddenly.

482
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,000
But then, the power restored.

483
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,719
I don't know what happened.

484
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,719
But the security guards said that

485
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,800
a person who's wearing a coat,
jeans and helmet

486
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,559
ran out from the building.

487
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:40,800
Lu Xiao, don't you think
that their descriptions

488
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,479
sound a lot like you?

489
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,680
Don't you think so?

490
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,359
Why did you shake your head?

491
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,920
Don't you think so?

492
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,319
They are not exactly the same.

493
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,880
Lu Xiao is not wearing a helmet.

494
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,079
Search the place.

495
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,640
Get down.

496
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,239
Get down.

497
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,680
Why did you take me here?

498
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,000
Am I going to go to
the hospital by metro?

499
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,000
I have no time to explain it to you.

500
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:27,159
(Xiang Hua Qiao Lu Station)

501
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,456
(Please do not follow
the dangerous activities.)

502
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,760
What kind of place is this?

503
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,400
There's a tunnel in front.

504
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,280
You can go back to Bay House from there.

505
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,199
Bay House?

506
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,239
Why am I going back to Bay House?

507
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:42,599
Our pursuers have left.

508
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,640
I can go to the hospital.

509
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,599
Now is not the time for you
to go to the hospital.

510
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,120
You've attracted
too much attention.

511
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,680
Mr. Xu might have already
found out about it.

512
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
The only thing you can do

513
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,880
is to go back now

514
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,040
and act like nothing happened, okay?

515
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,559
I'll find a chance to
get you out next time.

516
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,479
But does this tunnel
really lead to Bay House?

517
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,120
Trust me. Let's go now.

518
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,439
Mr. Xu, there's no helmet.

519
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,000
What about upstairs?

520
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,680
Okay.

521
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,120
If you cover up for him,
you'll be committing the same crime.

522
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,839
The power is back?

523
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,959
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

524
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,199
Good evening.

525
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,760
Why are you here so late at night?

526
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
I bought a candle.

527
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:33,959
Candle?

528
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,000
Yes.

529
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Aromatic candle.

530
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,280
The power went off just now.

531
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,880
You don't know

532
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,920
how far I went to buy this candle.

533
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,040
But it looks like
we don't need it anymore.

534
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,400
It's okay.

535
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,479
We can keep it for next time.

536
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,040
So, you ran out when

537
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,319
the power went off just now?

538
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,359
Yes. It was me.

539
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,319
