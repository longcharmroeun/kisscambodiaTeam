161
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,260
Of course he can tell! And he also likes you.

162
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,200
No way. How do you know?

163
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,900
I haven't been fascinated with imaginary couples for nothing!

164
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,650
Then do you think...do you think he has a girlfriend?

165
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,440
That's true...He looks so handsome.

166
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,630
There's no way he doesn't have a girlfriend.

167
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,680
Right...

168
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,080
Don't scare yourself though. Maybe he's been single his whole life?

169
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,880
Single his whole life doesn't seem possible. He's so great.

170
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,330
Isn't there a lot of male protagonists like that in novels?

171
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,620
Your meeting is so legendary, so anything is possible!

172
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,450
Maybe he's your perfect male protagonist.

173
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,150
-Right? Xin Xin?
-You You, I'll talk to you later.

174
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,180
Manager Du?

175
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,830
There is further news today about the crazed stalker causing alarm everywhere.

176
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,080
The police is currently conducting investigation according to the security cameras that recorded the suspect.

177
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,210
We also encourage citizens to actively provide evidence.

178
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,680
Hello, the phone number you called is unavailable at this time. Please dial again later.

179
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,940
Hello, I am Anxin's boyfriend. Is she at the company right now?

180
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,040
I haven't been able to get into touch with her. Can you let her know?

181
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,740
Oh...Anxin? She isn't at the company tonight. She doesn't have a shift tonight.

182
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,950
She left work right in the morning.

183
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,250
-What time did she leave?
-I think it was 6?

184
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,840
Oh, ok. Thank you.

185
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,090
President Ling, what are you...

186
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,810
Come inside to talk.

187
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,670
-Why have you come?
-Things are urgent, and I only found out now.

188
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,030
Look at this.

189
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,990
[Ling Group: Chairman Position Draft]

190
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,190
Tonight, President Ling Fang will secretly meet with the stockholders.

191
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,620
-When?
-10 pm at Michelle Hotel.

192
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,010
President Ling, if you don't leave now, I'm afraid it'll be too late.

193
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,430
Time goes by so fast.

194
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,810
I remember when you first arrived at the company,

195
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,320
you were still an intern who didn't know anything.

196
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,450
That's right. Time goes by so fast.

197
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,740
Actually, what happened last time,

198
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,040
I've always been very guilty.

199
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,020
I want to find an opportunity to apologize to you.

200
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,610
Whenever I get drunk, I act like a jerk.

201
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,710
I troubled you.

202
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,090
I'm really...sorry.

203
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,760
Manager Du, you actually don't have to apologize to me.

204
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,220
Just let things in the past pass.

205
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,520
I believe that you didn't do it on purpose either.

206
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,510
You believe me?

207
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,640
President Ling, Du Ming disappeared.

208
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,280
Keep looking. What time is it now?

209
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,160
9:00 PM. President Ling,

210
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
if you head back now you can still make it.

211
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,090
Leave finding Miss Anxin to me.

212
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,250
Let me down over there.

213
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,110
Okay.

214
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,120
I believe you.

215
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,170
Because I've also hurt someone before.

216
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,020
I was desperate for their forgiveness.

217
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,040
So, I understand you.

218
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,160
If you understand me,

219
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,650
then why are you doing this to me?

220
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,840
That does that mean?

221
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,190
If you understand me, then why did you harm me?

222
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,290
Why did you drive me into a corner?

223
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,750
I don't really understand what you mean. What do you mean by

224
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,420
driving you into a corner?

225
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,920
You look so innocent.

226
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,220
Anxin.

227
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,560
Anxin.

228
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,280
Anxin.

229
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,120
If I didn't know what you did to me, I'd be deceived by your pitiful face.

230
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,020
Even now, I still can't accept what you did to me.

231
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,100
Manager Du, I don't know what you're talking about but I think there must be a misunderstanding.

232
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,650
Misunderstanding? Wasn't I fired because of you?

233
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,850
Wasn't it because of you that I fell to this state?

234
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,730
It's not like that.

235
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,000
- I...I don't have to capabilities to do that.
- You don't.

236
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,040
The person behind you does.

237
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,760
Why do you have to force me?

238
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,830
Why won't you let me be?

239
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,240
We can just all go down together. What else?

240
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,250
- If you keep this on I'm going to call for someone.
- Call.

241
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,140
Call. Call. You call.

242
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,760
Call.

243
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,370
Anxin.

244
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
Anxin.

245
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Run. Run.

246
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,110
Why do you have to force me?

247
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,110
Why, why do you have to force me?

248
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,880
Say it.

249
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,520
Anxin.

250
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,280
How are you?

251
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,710
Are you okay? Don't worry, I'm here.

252
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,890
You didn't hurt yourself, right?

253
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,150
You leg.

254
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,690
My leg is fine. Here, I'll help you up.

255
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,420
Here.

256
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,690
Come.

257
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,770
Are you okay?

258
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,000
Careful.

259
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,610
Xiao Ba.

260
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,920
Xiao Ba.

261
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,760
Xiao Ba.

262
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,410
Come here.

263
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,480
What? You feel sorry for him?

264
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,980
Xiao Ba.

265
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,260
Xiao Ba.

266
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,740
Xiao Ba.

267
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,770
Should we take him to the hospital?

268
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,970
I examined him. It's nothing serious.

269
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,050
You should get on the car. I'll take you home first.

270
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,550
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah.

271
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,480
You should get on the car.

272
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,580
What should I call you?

273
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,250
You can just call me Ai Li.

274
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,160
You're Anxin, Right? I heard Xiao Ba mention you before.

275
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,260
So you guys are...?

276
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,670
Not what you think.

277
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,860
That's what I thought.

278
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,130
How can you like him.

279
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,600
Don't say it like that. He is my savior.

280
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,230
What I'm doing is my responsibility.

281
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,480
Do I turn right ahead, or?

282
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,800
Anxin.

283
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,930
Do I turn right ahead or keep straight?

284
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,330
Keep straight and turn right.

285
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,010
Okay.

286
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,860
Oh, left turn.

287
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,900
How come I'm here?

288
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,990
Ai Li brought you back. Shouldn't you thank her?

289
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,570
- Thanks.
- It's nothing.

290
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,620
I met you coincidentally anyways.

291
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,240
It's getting late. I also have to take that person to the police station.

292
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
I'll get going.

293
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,140
Be safe.

294
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,070
How did your leg suddenly get better?

295
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,480
It's probably a sudden spurt of activity before collapsing.

296
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,100
After I heard you yelling so loudly, I stood up out of desperation.

297
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,410
What do you mean?

298
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:32,400
It's my instincts that triggered my potential, you know?

299
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,840
I was just hit by that Winter Melon Du. Now I can't stand up again.

300
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,060
Sorry, I know it was because of me.

301
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,680
If you really are sorry,

302
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,400
then how about you massage me a few more times.

303
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,540
When did you learn to be so cunning?

304
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,840
I didn't teach you that.

305
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,780
Where's the wheelchair?

306
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,390
I was in a hurry so I forgot it there.

307
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,930
- I'll go find it right now.
- There's no need.

308
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,420
Ai Li said she'll buy me a new one, as thanks.

309
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,590
After all, I helped her before.

310
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,540
But she saved your life today.

311
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,010
How will you thank her?

312
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,480
That's right too, why does she treat me so well?

313
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,270
Do you think she likes me?

314
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,480
How is that possible.

315
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,780
Ai Li has such good skills,

316
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,330
she might be a police.

317
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,230
I don't know either.

318
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,120
Let's go.

319
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,040
Let's go home.

320
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,580
Take it slowly.

321
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,080
It's already 11pm.

322
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,080
Do you need to do something?

323

It's fine now.

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,320
I won't let him appear in front of you again.

325
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,250
Then what if he still does?

326
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,800
I won't let this sort of thing happen again.

327
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,720
But what if it does?

328
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,560
I'm here for you.

329
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,490
Okay.

330
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,500
Then that's...

331
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,200
It's a pinky promise. Seal it.

332
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,220
Seal it.

333
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,560
This is how you do it.

00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Get some sleep soon.

Come in.

00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,140
You're here.

339
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,050
Father, what do you think of this proposal?

340
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,160
I had a look already. Not bad.

341
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,250
The idea is quite unique.

342
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,150
Then how much money are you planning to invest into this?

343
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,800
Your father hasn't finished speaking yet.

344
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,820
If you want to go with this

345
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,530
You'll need spend some time to consider it yourself.

346
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,610
After all there are risks involved.

347
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,990
All in all, it seems that you don't want to invest in this.

348
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,360
You...you should leave this tough work to the men.

349
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,160
- You shouldn't waste your time on this.
- I can do it too.

350
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,440
Since you are not interested in this proposal,

351
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,500
then I will take this away.

352
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,350
I heard that you've been looking for the Ling family's son.

353
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,780
Which one?

354
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,760
The daughter of mine

has plenty of admirers.

356
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,710
You don't have to waste all your time on him.

357
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,900
If he doesn't come back, I think that's for the better.

358
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
Understood, father.

359
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,910
Director Ling, about the shareholders that Director Ling Feng saw previously,

360
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,750
some of them have been seeking the chairman recently.

361
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,640
I fear that they may be discussing about the shareholders' meeting.

362
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,550
Do you think that Director Ling Feng may be...

363
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,030
Those old things won't be easily bribed.

364
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,510
But since it's been a while since I last made an appearance, they will waver a bit for sure.

365
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,420
It's understandable if they are looking for someone for backing.

366
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,320
Then, when are you thinking to return?

367
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,670
A bit longer.

368
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,040
It's everything sorted with Du Ming?

369
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,370
Rest assured, the crimes combined won't let him live comfortably.

370
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,660
Also, Du Ming has said.

371
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,720
He only chose Miss An Jing

372
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,710
because someone made sure he can't back out so he had no other choice.

373
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,330
-Who was it?
- Not sure yet.

374
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,030
But he's saying that we did it.

375
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,220
Then it seems that someone is trying to frame us.

376
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,950
Could it be Director Ling Feng?

377
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,200
No way. Knowing my brother, if he knew i'm still alive,

378
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,040
he wouldn't be so quiet.

379
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
Then who could it be?

380
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,280
Don't worry. They will show up soon.

381

Who are you on a call with?

383
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,820
It's Ai Li, she said the wheelchair she bought for us has arrived.

384
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,880
Ours?

385
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,960
She bought it for you.

386
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,770
Then I'll retrieve it for you after I get off work.

387
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,970
No need, she says that it'll be delivered to the door.

388
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,720
That's quite thoughtful.

389
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,230
She quite good to you.

390
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,350
Yes, not bad.

391
