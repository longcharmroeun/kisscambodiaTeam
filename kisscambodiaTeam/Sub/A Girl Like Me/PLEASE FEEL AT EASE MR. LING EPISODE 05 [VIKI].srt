Hello, I am Anxin's boyfriend. Is she at the company right now?

180
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,040
I haven't been able to get into touch with her. Can you let her know?

181
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,740
Oh...Anxin? She isn't at the company tonight. She doesn't have a shift tonight.

182
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,950
She left work right in the morning.

183
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,250
-What time did she leave?
-I think it was 6?

Oh, ok. Thank you.

President Ling, what are you...

186
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,810
Come inside to talk.

187
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,670
-Why have you come?
-Things are urgent, and I only found out now.

188

-10 pm at Michelle Hotel.

192
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,010
President Ling, if you don't leave now, I'm afraid it'll be too late.

193
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,430
Time goes by so fast.

194
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,810
I remember when you first arrived at the company,

195
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,320
you were still an intern who didn't know anything.

196
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,450
That's right. Time goes by so fast.

197
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,740
Actually, what happened last time,

198
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,040
I've always been very guilty.

199
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,020
I want to find an opportunity to apologize to you.

200
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,610
Whenever I get drunk, I act like a jerk.

201
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,710
I troubled you.

202
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,090
I'm really...sorry.

203
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,760
Manager Du, you actually don't have to apologize to me.

204
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,220
Just let things in the past pass.

205
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,520
I believe that you didn't do it on purpose either.

206
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,510
You believe me?

207
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,640
President Ling, Du Ming disappeared.

208
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,280
Keep looking. What time is it now?

209

9:00 PM. President Ling,

210
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
if you head back now you can still make it.

211
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,090
Leave finding Miss Anxin to me.

212
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,250
Let me down over there.

213
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,110
Okay.

214
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,120
I believe you.

215
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,170
Because I've also hurt someone before.

216
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,020
I was desperate for their forgiveness.

217
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,040
So, I understand you.

218
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,160
If you understand me,

219
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,650
then why are you doing this to me?

220
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,840
That does that mean?

221
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,190
If you understand me, then why did you harm me?

222
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,290
Why did you drive me into a corner?

223
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,750
I don't really understand what you mean. What do you mean by

224
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,420
driving you into a corner?

225
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,920
You look so innocent.

226
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,220
Anxin.

227
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,560

Anxin.

229
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
If I didn't know what you did to me, I'd be deceived by your pitiful face.

230
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,020
Even now, I still can't accept what you did to me.

231
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,100
Manager Du, I don't know what you're talking about but I think there must be a misunderstanding.

232
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,650
Misunderstanding? Wasn't I fired because of you?

233
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,850
Wasn't it because of you that I fell to this state?

234
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,730
It's not like that.

235
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,000
- I...I don't have to capabilities to do that.
- You don't.

236
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,040
The person behind you does.

237
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,760
Why do you have to force me?

238
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,830
Why won't you let me be?

239
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,240
We can just all go down together. What else?

240
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,250
- If you keep this on I'm going to call for someone.
- Call.

241
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,140
Call. Call. You call.

242
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,760

Run. Run.

246
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,110
Why do you have to force me?

247
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,110
Why, why do you have to force me?

248
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,880
Say it.

249
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,520

Are you okay? Don't worry, I'm here.

Come.

Are you okay?

258
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,000
Careful.

259
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,610

260
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,920

261
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,760
Xiao Ba.

262
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,410
Come here.

263
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,480
What? You feel sorry for him?

264
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,980
Xiao Ba.

265
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,260
Xiao Ba.

266
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,740
Xiao Ba.

267
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,770
Should we take him to the hospital?

268
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,970
I examined him. It's nothing serious.

269
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,050
You should get on the car. I'll take you home first.

270
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,550
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah.

271
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,480
You should get on the car.

272
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,580
What should I call you?

273
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,250
You can just call me Ai Li.

274

You're Anxin, Right? I heard Xiao Ba mention you before.

275

So you guys are...?

276
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,670
Not what you think.

277
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,860
That's what I thought.

278
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,130
How can you like him.

279
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,600
Don't say it like that. He is my savior.

280
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,230
What I'm doing is my responsibility.

281
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,480
Do I turn right ahead, or?

Anxin.

283
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,930
Do I turn right ahead or keep straight?

284
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,330
Keep straight and turn right.

285
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,010
Okay.

286
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,860
Oh, left turn.

287
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,900
How come I'm here?

288
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,990
Ai Li brought you back. Shouldn't you thank her?

289
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,570
- Thanks.
- It's nothing.

290
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,620
I met you coincidentally anyways.

291
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,240
It's getting late. I also have to take that person to the police station.

292

I'll get going.

293

Be safe.

294
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,070
How did your leg suddenly get better?

295
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,480
It's probably a sudden spurt of activity before collapsing.

296
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,100
After I heard you yelling so loudly, I stood up out of desperation.

297
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,410
What do you mean?

298
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,400
It's my instincts that triggered my potential, you know?

299
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,840
I was just hit by that Winter Melon Du. Now I can't stand up again.

300
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,060
Sorry, I know it was because of me.

301
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,680
If you really are sorry,

302
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,400
then how about you massage me a few more times.

303
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,540
When did you learn to be so cunning?

304
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,840
I didn't teach you that.

305
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,780
Where's the wheelchair?

306
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,390
I was in a hurry so I forgot it there.

307
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,930
- I'll go find it right now.
- There's no need.

308
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,420
Ai Li said she'll buy me a new one, as thanks.

309
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,590
After all, I helped her before.

310
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,540
But she saved your life today.

311
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,010
How will you thank her?

312
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,480
That's right too, why does she treat me so well?

313
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,270
Do you think she likes me?

314
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,480
How is that possible.

315
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,780
Ai Li has such good skills,

316
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,330
she might be a police.

317
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,230
I don't know either.

318
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,120
Let's go.

319
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,040
Let's go home.

323
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,140
It's fine now.

324
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,320
I won't let him appear in front of you again.

325
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,250
Then what if he still does?

326
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,800
I won't let this sort of thing happen again.

327
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,720
But what if it does?

I'm here for you.

Okay.

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,500
Then that's...

331
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,200
It's a pinky promise. Seal it.

332
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,220
Seal it.

333
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,560
This is how you do it.

334
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Get some sleep soon.

335
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,200

337

Come in.

338
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,140
You're here.

339
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,050
Father, what do you think of this proposal?

340
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,160
I had a look already. Not bad.

341
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,250
The idea is quite unique.

342
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,150
Then how much money are you planning to invest into this?

343
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,800
Your father hasn't finished speaking yet.

344
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,820
If you want to go with this

345
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,530
You'll need spend some time to consider it yourself.

346
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,610
After all there are risks involved.

347
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,990
All in all, it seems that you don't want to invest in this.

348
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,360
You...you should leave this tough work to the men.

349
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,160
- You shouldn't waste your time on this. 
 - I can do it too.

350

00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,780
Which one?

354
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,760
The daughter of mine

355
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,480
has plenty of admirers.

356
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,710
You don't have to waste all your time on him.

357
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,900
If he doesn't come back, I think that's for the better.

358
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,820
Understood, father.

359
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,910
Director Ling, about the shareholders that Director Ling Feng saw previously,

360
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,750
some of them have been seeking the chairman recently.

361
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,640
I fear that they may be discussing about the shareholders' meeting.

362
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,550
Do you think that Director Ling Feng may be...

363
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,030
Those old things won't be easily bribed.

364
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,510
But since it's been a while since I last made an appearance, they will waver a bit for sure.

365
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,420
It's understandable if they are looking for someone for backing.

366
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,320
Then, when are you thinking to return?

367
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,670
A bit longer.

368
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,040
It's everything sorted with Du Ming?

369
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,370
 Rest assured, the crimes combined won't let him live comfortably.

370
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,660
Also, Du Ming has said.

371
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,720
He only chose Miss An Jing

372
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,710
because someone made sure he can't back out so he had no other choice.

373
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,330
-Who was it? 
 - Not sure yet.

374
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,030
But he's saying that we did it.

375
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,220
Then it seems that someone is trying to frame us.

376
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,950
Could it be Director Ling Feng?

377
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,200
No way. Knowing my brother, if he knew i'm still alive,

378
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,040
he wouldn't be so quiet.

379
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,640
Then who could it be?

380
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,280
Don't worry. They will show up soon.

381
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,150
Find out for me whether the time of the shareholders' meeting has been decided.

382
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,650
Who are you on a call with?

383
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,820
It's Ai Li, she said the wheelchair she bought for us has arrived.

384
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,880
Ours?

385
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
She bought it for you.

386
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,770
Then I'll retrieve it for you after I get off work.

387
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,970
No need, she says that it'll be delivered to the door.

388
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
That's quite thoughtful.

389
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,230
She quite good to you.

390
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,350
Yes, not bad.

391
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,460
Have a look, this one's not bad. It's quite nice.

392
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,090
You can choose a few more to complement each other.

393
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,720
- Oh this purple one is quite nice. 
 - Hello, did you want to purchase some flowers?

394
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,830
[Director Ling: Shun Jun Hotel, Room 1205]

395
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,950
[There's someone tailing you, lose them first.

396
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,700
No, what's this situation? Going to the bar during the day!?

397
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,820
Who knows? Let's just wait for now.

398
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,890
Hello, this is for 'Cutie'.

399
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,600
- Okay, thank you. 
 - No worries.

400
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,170
Sorry, non-hotel residents cannot go up,

401
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,140
No, I know him. I need to speak to him.

402
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,060
Then may ask what is his name?

403
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,840
Next time, make the name up before you try again.

404
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,140
Is there a need for me to make up a name?

405
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,570
I really know him that's why–

406
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,730
Fine.

407
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,350
Thank you.

408
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,390
Hello, I made a reservation.

409
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,790
- Can I confirm your name? 
 - Ai Li.

410
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,790
'Ai' as in wormwood, 'Li' as in bamboo hat.

411
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,240
Your room key card has been retrieved by the man you are staying with.

412
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,550
He just went up in his wheelchair.

413
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,300
Didn't you realize that you were being followed?

414
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,090
Why are Ling Feng's men suddenly following you?

415
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,320
Sorry, it must be that the movement of acquiring of the Express Delivery Service was too big.

416
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,880
-  We can't hide it anymore. 
 - There has been an update with the shareholders' meeting as well.

417
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,580
It's about the changing of CEO.

418
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,320
The chairman was considering all this time.

419
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,280
But today, it was suddenly announced that there would be a meeting tomorrow.

420
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,340
It will be to give Director Ling Feng the position of CEO.

421
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,790
Director Ling, you must return to the family immediately.

422
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,870
Let's go. It's about time I gave them a surprise.

423
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,250
Then do you want to tell Miss An Xin?

424
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,060
If you leave without informing her, she would be worried.

425
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,000
So you two are...

426
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,830
It's not what you think it is.

427
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,860
Do you think she fell for me?

428
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,100
[Something came up for me.]

429
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,090
[I'll look for you when I'm done.]

430
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,490
[What's wrong?]

431
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,480
[Are you with Ai Li?]

432
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,110
Recently, the Ling Group has encountered some unhappy incidents.

433
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,340
To be entrusted at such a critical moment, I have also felt the pressure.

434
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,840
However, I really appreciate the trust everyone here placed in me.

435
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,740
I will take on the responsibilities as CEO.

436
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,600
I will lead us into the future!

437
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,180
I do not agree.

438
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,870
Director Ling! Director Ling is back. It's really him!

439
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,780
It's second brother! Father, he's alive!

440
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:44,560
