(រឿងល្ខោននេះគឺជាការប្រឌិតសុទ្ធសាធហើយមិនត្រូវបានផ្សារភ្ជាប់ជាមួយនឹង ... )

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,671

(CGI ត្រូវបានប្រើនៅក្នុងឈុតភាគច្រើនដែលរួមបញ្ចូលទាំងសត្វ។ )

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,211
តើអ្នកនៅទីនេះយ៉ាងដូចម្តេច?

8
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,621
មិនយូរប៉ុន្មានដានីយ៉ែលលីបានធ្វើឃាតកម្ម។

9
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,821
នេះជាគោលដៅបន្ទាប់របស់អ្នក។

10
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:11,630
ពិចារណាមនុស្សនេះជាមំសាសីលំដាប់កំពូល។

11
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,600
នេះគឺជាអាស័យដ្ឋានដែលគាត់បានអោយខ្ញុំ។

12
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,500
អ្នកប្រាកដជាមានការចងចាំល្អ។

13
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:22,071
អ្នកនឹងមានហ្សែនរបស់សត្វមំសាសីនិងទេពកោសល្យ។

14
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,021
ដូច្នេះហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកនៅទីនេះ?

15
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:45,091
ស៊ុងយ៉ូហាននិងខ្ញុំ។

16
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,160
តើយើងជាសត្វកណ្តុរមន្ទីរពិសោធន៍របស់អ្នកទេ?

17
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,670
ខ្ញុំគួរតែចាប់ផ្តើមដោយអរគុណអ្នក។

18
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,871
អរគុណដែលធំឡើងក្លាយជាឃាតករ

19
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,211
ជុងបារាម។

20
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:02,350
វាអាក្រក់ណាស់ដែលស៊ុងយ៉ូហានធ្វើឱ្យខ្ញុំខកចិត្ត។

21
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,950
លុះត្រាតែវិក័យប័ត្របញ្ឈប់ការមានផ្ទៃពោះ ...

22
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,850
ជាមួយនឹងទារកក្នុងផ្ទៃដែលផ្ទុកហ្សែនផ្នែកចិត្តសាស្រ្តត្រូវបានអនុម័ត ...

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,391
Actually,

24
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,391
I thought it being dismissed gave me an opportunity.

25
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,561
The assembly would've never agreed to it anyway.

26
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:20,531
In order for the bill to pass, I knew I needed a long-term plan.

27
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,500
A long-term plan?

28
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,440
That's why you went to Daniel.

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,371
I asked for the list of mothers who were pregnant...

30
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,311
with babies carrying the psychopath gene.

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,141
Daniel was in shock after finding out...

32
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:34,811
that Han Seo Joon had killed his sister,

33
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:36,681
so he was easy to convince.

34
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,350
Is this the right course of action?

35
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,750
I can't be certain either.

36
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,760
However, we can't reach Utopia without going through a war...

37
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,260
or fighting off crimes.

38
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,290
It's ours to build.

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Think about Jennifer's death.

40
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,801
Let's make sure that no one dies like she did.

41
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,220
Once we grew up to be psychopathic killers,

42
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,361
you were to use that as evidence to pass the bill.

43
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,431
You did so by forming a black ops unit...

44
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,531
នៅក្នុងសេវាស៊ើបការណ៍សម្ងាត់ជាតិ។

45
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:27,431
ត្រឹមត្រូវហើយ។

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,931
យើងសង្កេតឃើញម្តាយនិងទារកក្នុងផ្ទៃអំឡុងពេលមានផ្ទៃពោះ។

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,871
ដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាកុមារត្រូវបាននាំយកទៅតាមលក្ខខណ្ឌ។

48
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,711
ផ្តល់កំណើតឱ្យកូនរបស់អ្នក។

49
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,771
នៅពេលដែលក្មេងប្រុសទាំងពីរកើតមក

50
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,610
ភ្នាក់ងារត្រូវបានគេដាក់ឱ្យសង្កេតមើលសកម្មភាពរបស់ពួកគេ។

51
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,951
ពួកគេនឹងបញ្ជូនរបាយការណ៍របស់ពួកគេហើយអ្នកជំនាញធ្វើការវិភាគ ...

52
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,751
អ្វីដែលត្រូវបានគេសង្កេតឃើញ។

53
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,831
នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលអ្នកបញ្ជាទិញសុងសូហូ ...

54
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,761
ដើម្បីសំលាប់ម្តាយរបស់ខ្ញុំដែលបានព្យាយាមសំលាប់ខ្ញុំ ...

55
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,360
និងគ្រួសាររបស់ខ្ញុំដែលនៅសល់?

56
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,800
នោះគឺជាគ្រោះថ្នាក់។

57
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,511
វាបានបំផ្លាញសុងសូហូទាំងស្រុង។

58
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,470
ប៉ុន្តែគាត់គ្មានជំរើសទេ។

59
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,711
បើគ្មានអ្នកទេការពិសោធន៍នឹងត្រូវបានបញ្ចប់។

60
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,720
តើអ្នកអាចទាញយកផលប្រយោជន៍ពីសមាជិកគ្រួសារជនរងគ្រោះយ៉ាងដូចម្តេច?

61
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,050
តើមនុស្សមានលក្ខណៈដូចម្ដេច?

62
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,290
យើងគ្រាន់តែឱ្យគាត់ដឹងដូច្នេះយើងអាចសុបិន្តពិភពតែមួយ។

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,631
ពិភពលោកដែលគ្មានជនរងគ្រោះគ្មានសមាជិកគ្រួសារដែលបាត់បង់

64
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,990
និងគ្មានបទឧក្រិដ្ឋ។

65
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,701
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនចូលរួម

66
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,531
នៅពេលដែលខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមសម្លាប់ឃាតករចិត្តសាស្រ្តផ្សេងទៀត?

67
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,701
វាជាការពិតដែលថាសកម្មភាពរបស់អ្នកបានធ្វើឱ្យខ្ញុំប្រុងប្រយ័ត្ន។

68
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,571
ប៉ុន្តែការមើលឃើញជាសាធារណៈថាអ្នកជាវីរៈបុរសបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរគំនិតខ្ញុំ។

69
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,711
នៅពេលដែលសាធារណជនដែលបានឃើញអ្នកជាអ្នកធ្វើសង្គ្រាម។

70
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,251
ស្វែងយល់ពីអ្នក

71
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,651
ពួកគេនឹងត្រូវខ្ទេចខ្ទី។

72
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,480
ហើយការអនុម័តវិក្កយបត្រនឹងកាន់តែងាយស្រួល។

73
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,321
អ្នកបានឆ្លៀតយកប្រយោជន៍ពីក្រុមគ្រួសារជនរងគ្រោះ ...

74
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,961
និងបានសម្លាប់ប្រជាជនស្លូតត្រង់។

75
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,961
អ្នកគឺជាសត្វចម្លែកដូចខ្ញុំដែរចយយ៉ុងស៊ីន។

76
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:16,870
ខ្ញុំពិតជាអ្នកវិទ្យាសាស្ត្រ។ អ្នកជំនាញខាងពន្ធុវិទ្យាត្រូវពិតប្រាកដ។

77
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,680
មានតែវិទ្យាសាស្ត្រទេដែលអាចដោះស្រាយឧក្រិដ្ឋកម្មនៃពិភពលោកនេះ។

78
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,511
ការបញ្ឈប់ឃាតករសក្តានុពលមុនពេលពួកគេកើត ...

79
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:26,451
ដូច្នេះយើងអាចរស់នៅក្នុង Utopia គ្មានឃាតកម្មការប្រយុទ្ធនិងសង្គ្រាម ...

80
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,151
គឺជាគោលដៅចុងក្រោយរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

81
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,151
នៅលើពិភពលោកខ្ញុំសុបិនចង់

82
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:36,391
ឃាតករចិត្តសាស្ត្រដូចជាអ្នកមិនគួរមានទេ។

83
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,930
អ្នកនឹងមិនត្រូវបាននាំឱ្យមានរយៈពេល។

84
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,410
ទៅ​ពេល​ខាង​មុខ។ សម្លាប់​ខ្ញុំ។

85
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,951
ស្លាប់យ៉ាងសាហាវនៅក្នុងដៃរបស់អ្នក…

86
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,151
នឹងធ្វើឱ្យយើងឈានមួយជំហានខិតទៅជិតពិភពសុបិន្តរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

87
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,920
សង្គមកាន់តែវិវត្តទៅជាហ្សែនផ្នែកចិត្តសាស្ត្រ ...

88
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,591
រីករាលដាលពាសពេញពិភពលោកដូចជាជម្ងឺ។

89
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,761
ថ្ងៃមួយ

90
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:12,930
អ្នកដែលមានហ្សែនផ្នែកចិត្តសាស្រ្តនឹងបំផ្លាញយើងជាមនុស្សសាមញ្ញ។

91
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,031
មុនពេលរឿងនោះកើតឡើង

92
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,870
ហ្សែនផ្នែកចិត្តសាស្រ្តត្រូវតែលុបបំបាត់ចោល។

93
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,941
សម្លាប់​ខ្ញុំ។ សម្លាប់​ខ្ញុំ!

94
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,821
តើកន្លែងនេះជាអ្វី?

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,461
តើផ្ទះនេះជាអ្នកណា?

96
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,310
តើមានអ្វីនៅលើផែនដី?

97
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,980
តើនេះជាផ្ទះសំណាក់នៅរដូវក្តៅមែនទេ?

98
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,660
សុងសូហូ!

99
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,990
(ដែនដីអូរហ្សីដែលជាតំបន់អ៊ូបផូបគ្មានទីពឹង)

100
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,261
អ្នកស៊ើបអង្កេតលី?

101
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,531
(ដែនដីអូរហ្សីដែលជាតំបន់អ៊ូបផូបគ្មានទីពឹង)

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
តើមានអ្វីនៅលើផែនដី?

103
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:43,891
កុំព្យូទ័រយួរដៃ។

104
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,091
គាត់បានស្លាប់ដោយសារតែកុំព្យូទ័រយួរដៃនោះ។

105
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,391
នេះគឺជាកន្លែងដែលអ្នកបោកប្រាស់បានសម្លាប់អ្នកស៊ើបអង្កេតស៊ីន។

106
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:40,710
សម្លាប់​ខ្ញុំ។ សម្លាប់ខ្ញុំរួចហើយ!

107
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,210
ដើម្បីសង្គ្រោះជីវិតខ្ញុំ

108
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,281
អ្នកលុតជង្គង់នៅមុខហានស៊ីអូជុន។

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,550
ប៉ុន្តែការវះកាត់នោះ ...

110
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:52,861
ផ្តល់ឱ្យខ្ញុំនូវអារម្មណ៍ដែលមាននរណាម្នាក់ដូចខ្ញុំមិនគួរមានអារម្មណ៍។

111
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,430
មន្ទីរពិសោធន៍កណ្តុររបស់អ្នក ...

112
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,560
មិនអាចសម្លាប់ទៀតទេ។

113
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,300
ទេ

114
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,069
សម្លាប់​ខ្ញុំ។ សម្លាប់ខ្ញុំឥឡូវនេះ។

115

116
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,308
តាមវិធីនេះមនុស្សនឹងទៅរស់នៅក្នុងពិភពលោកដែលមានសុវត្ថិភាពនិងសន្តិភាព!

117

សម្លាប់​ខ្ញុំ! ប្រញាប់ឡើងសម្លាប់ខ្ញុំទៅ!

118
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,589
អ្នក ...

119
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,518
គឺគួរអោយអាណិតណាស់។

120
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:00,018
ជុងបារាមអ្នកលេងសើចនោះ។

121
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,428
អ្នកមានសារជាសំលេងមួយ។

122
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:09,428
អ្នកស៊ើបអង្កេតកូខ្ញុំនឹងសម្លាប់បុរសដែលសម្លាប់យាយខ្ញុំ។

123
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,969
ខ្ញុំក៏នឹងសងសឹកជំនួសបងប្រុសរបស់អ្នកដែរ។

124
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:14,069
ដុសខាត់វា។ បងប៊ីយី!

125
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:25,379
លោកស្រី គីម?

126
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,079
តើ​អ្នក​កំពុង​ធ្វើអ្វី​នៅ​ទីនេះ?

127
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,788
បារាម! បារ៉េមនៅទីណា?

128
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,918
ត្រជាក់ចិត្ត។ គាត់បានធ្វើវាដើម្បីការពារអ្នកឱ្យមានសុវត្ថិភាព។

129
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:36,589
ដើម្បីឱ្យខ្ញុំមានសុវត្ថិភាព?

130
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,099
ឆាប់អ្នកនឹងរកឃើញការពិត។

131
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,239
អូហូងយីនឹងត្រូវគេយកទៅហើយរកឃើញថាជាសាកសពមែនទេ?

132
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,308
ឬនាងនឹងត្រូវបោះបង់ចោលដោយសុវត្ថិភាពនៅគោលដៅរបស់នាង?

133
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,579
ខ្ញុំគិតថាពួកគេអាចនឹងចាប់ចំណាប់ខ្មាំងរបស់នាង។

134
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,388
ត្រូវប្រាកដថានាងមិនដែលចាកចេញពីកន្លែងនេះរហូតដល់ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើ។

135
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:09,829
សូមថែរក្សានៅសល់។

136

00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:23,508
លែងជាមនុស្សដែលអ្នកធ្លាប់ជា

139
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,609
គ្រាន់តែឃើញថាអ្នកមិនបានសំលាប់ Choi Young Shin ។

140
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,308
នោះនៅតែមិនផ្លាស់ប្តូរអ្វីទាំងអស់។

141
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:00,609
បារាម! បារាម!

142
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,349
តើអ្នកអាចតាមដានទូរស័ព្ទដៃរបស់ Bong Yi បានទេ?

143
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:43,188
ឆ្មាមួយ ...

144
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,558
បារាម, ដុកទ័រដុន។

145
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:53,959
សួស្តី?

146
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,028
ដុំប្លាស្ទិកនោះមកពីរបាំងពពែមេន។

147
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,199
យើងបានរកឃើញឌីអិនអេរបស់គីមហានកឃីនៅលើវា។

148
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,969
វាគឺបារាម។

149
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,778
គាត់ជាមនុស្សឆ្កួតដែលបានសម្លាប់បងប្អូនខ្ញុំ។

150
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:16,089

អ្នកស៊ើបអង្កេត។

153
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,058
តើធ្វើដូចម្តេចអំពីភេសជ្ជៈមួយ?

154
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,758
មន្រ្តីជុងខ្ញុំបាន heard ...

155
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,829
អ្នកតែងតែល្អចំពោះបងប្រុសរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

156
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:32,629
ខ្ញុំចង់ក្លាយជាប្រភេទបងប្រុសដែល Moo Won ធ្លាប់នៅជាមួយខ្ញុំ។

157
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:45,249
ប៊ងយី។

158
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,548
អ្នកឆ្កួតគួរឱ្យស្អប់ខ្ពើម។

159
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:50,719
តើ​វា​សប្បាយ​ទេ?

160
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,388
តើអ្នករីករាយនឹងខ្លួនអ្នកទេ?

161
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,428
អ្នកត្រូវតែបានរកឃើញថាវាគួរឱ្យចង់សើចណាស់នៅជុំវិញខ្ញុំ។

162
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,258
បើគ្មានតម្រុយតិចតួចទេ

163
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:06,898
ខ្ញុំបានបញ្ចប់ការដួលសម្រាប់បុរសដែលបានសម្លាប់យាយខ្ញុំ។

168
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,188
ភ្នែកសម្រាប់ភ្នែក, ធ្មេញសម្រាប់ធ្មេញ។

169
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:32,388
សម្រង់សំណព្វរបស់អ្នក។

170
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,999

ទេបង Bong Yi ។ ខ្ញុំមិនអាចធ្វើឱ្យអ្នកក្លាយជាឃាតករបានទេ។

175
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:29,249
យាយរបស់ខ្ញុំយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ចំពោះអ្នកខ្លាំងណាស់។

176
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,388

តើអ្នកអាចធ្វើដូច្នេះដោយរបៀបណា?

235
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,260
- បិសាចអ្នក! - ថយចេញ។

236
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:15,129
- ឈរត្រឡប់មកវិញ។ - បិសាចអ្នក!

237
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,879
រក្សាការសន្យារបស់អ្នក។

238
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,809
រក្សាការសន្យារបស់អ្នកចំពោះម៉ូជី។

239
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,819
តោះ​ចាប់ផ្ដើម។ ចាប់ផ្តើមប្រើថ្នាំសន្លប់។

240
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:39,950
លើកក្បាលរបស់អ្នក។

241
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:45,462
ខ្ញុំនឹងចាប់ផ្តើមស្រក់ឥឡូវនេះ។

242
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:50,372
ខ្ញុំ​ខ្លាច។

243
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,301
ខ្ញុំ​អត់​សប្បាយចិត្ត។

244
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:56,041
ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យដែលចាក់នៅចន្លោះស្លឹកធ្វើឱ្យខ្ញុំខកចិត្ត។

245
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,642
- រង់ចាំ។ - វិកលចរិត ...

246
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:00,781
មិនអាចមានអារម្មណ៍អ្វីទាំងអស់។

247
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,162
ប្រសិនបើគាត់មិនមែនជាឃាតករ

248
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,531
ហេតុអ្វីបានជារូបភាពនៃរាងកាយរបស់ Byun Soon Young នៅទីនេះ?

249
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:26,771
គាត់បានលាក់បាំងហានកឃីនៅទីនេះហើយនាំគាត់ទៅមន្ទីរពេទ្យដែលគេបោះបង់ចោល។

250
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:39,051
("ដានហាន់ឃីកត្រូវបានរក្សាទុកនៅក្នុងមន្ទីរពេទ្យដែលគេបោះបង់ចោលត្រូវបានរកឃើញ")

251
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:07,251
ប្រាកដ។ ប្រសិនបើមានអ្វីនៅទីនេះប៉ូលីសនឹងរកឃើញ។

252
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,281
លោកស្រី ចុយ?

253
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,831
វេជ្ជបណ្ឌិតលី។

254
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:38,811
តើវាជាបារាមមែនទេ?

255
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:48,021
ខ្ញុំនឹងស្លាប់ទៅហើយបើវាមិនមែនសំរាប់យ៉ូហាន។

256
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:51,622
ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងទេ ...

257
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:54,892
និងបានប្រាប់លោក Choi Young Shin ...

258
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:05,402
តើអ្នកទំនេរនៅយប់ថ្ងៃស្អែកទេ?

259
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:08,311
ខ្ញុំនឹងប្រាប់អ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នានូវថ្ងៃស្អែក។

260
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,912
ខ្ញុំបានសម្លាប់អ្នក។

261
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,111
វាជាកំហុសរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

262
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,361
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាប៉ូលីសមិនរកវាឃើញ?

263
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:11,142
មានផ្លូវចូលលូ។

264
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,571
ខ្ញុំបានលាក់ខ្លួននៅទីនោះនៅពេលដែលប៉ូលីសបានឆ្មក់ចូល។

265
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,182
ខ្ញុំ​ឃើញ។

266
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,652
ខ្ញុំនឹងមើលថែអ្នករហូតដល់អ្នកបានជាសះស្បើយ។

267
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:22,882
សូមអរគុណ។

268
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:27,521
ខ្ញុំនឹងធ្វើអ្វីក៏ដោយដើម្បីលុបឈ្មោះយូហាន។

269
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,091
ទេ

270
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,761
នោះមិនគ្រប់គ្រាន់ទេ។

271
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:34,761
បារាមបាត់បង់ការចងចាំ។

272
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,601
គាត់គិតថាគាត់ជាមនុស្សចិត្តល្អ។

273
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,172
ប្រើគាត់មុនពេលសភាវគតិរបស់គាត់ភ្ញាក់

274
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,031
និងកម្ចាត់ scumbags ដែលសមនឹងស្លាប់។

275
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,712
ហើយប្រសិនបើឆយយ៉ាំងស៊ីប្រាប់ពិភពលោកថាគាត់ជានរណា?

276
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:50,882
យើងនឹងវាយនាងហើយប្រាប់ពិភពលោកថាបារាមគឺជានរណា ...

277
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:54,556

279
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,766
ខ្ញុំបានឃើញពីការជិតស្និទ្ធ ...

280
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:08,236
អ្វីដែលគាត់គឺជាសត្វចម្លែក។

281
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:11,607
មនុស្សដូចនោះមិនអាចផ្លាស់ប្តូរបានទេ។

282
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:14,677
សូមអោយអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាដកខ្លួនចេញ ...

283
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:16,917
ដូចជាបារេម។

284
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:22,556
សូមប្រាកដថាគ្មាននរណាម្នាក់បញ្ចប់ដូចបងស្រីរបស់អ្នកទេ ...

285
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:26,256

286
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,766
បន្ទាប់មកខ្ញុំនឹងត្រូវការឧបករណ៍មន្ទីរពិសោធន៍។

288
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:46,377
សម្លាប់ឃាតករនោះ!

289
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,157
តោះ​ទៅ។ តោះ​ទៅ!

290
00:27:57,587 --> 00:27:59,556
ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែសំលាប់កខ្វក់នោះ។ តោះ​ទៅ!

291
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:01,157
ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែសម្លាប់គាត់!

292
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,097
- ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែសំលាប់គាត់។ - ត្រជាក់ចិត្ត។

293
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,766
អ្នកដឹងពីរបៀបដែលគាត់បានសម្លាប់បងប្អូនរបស់ខ្ញុំ។

294
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,667
អេ​លោក! ចេញពីទីនេះ។

295
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,736
តោះ​ទៅ! ហេ។

296
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:18,107
ហេ!

297
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:25,647
(ភ្នាក់ងារប៉ូលីសម៉មមីន)

298
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:31,087
អ្នកត្រូវប្រាប់យើងពីមូលហេតុដែលអ្នកត្រូវបានចងភ្ជាប់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះនោះ។

299
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,167
តើមានអ្វីកើតឡើង ...

300
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:39,427
នៅសួនកម្សាន្តមួយឆ្នាំមុន?

301
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:44,437
និយាយអ្វីមួយ។ តើអ្នកចង់បានមេធាវីទេ?

302
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:49,536
- ស្អី? - ម្តាយរបស់ស៊ុងយូហាន ...

303
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:51,407
កំពុងតែសុំមើលបារាម។

304
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:54,417
អ្វី? គ្មានផ្លូវទេ។ នាងនឹងព្យាយាមសម្លាប់គាត់។

305
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:57,847
គ្មានអ្វីនឹងកើតឡើងទេ។ ឱ្យនាងជួបគាត់។

306
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:06,236
ខ្ញុំសង្ស័យថានាងនឹងសម្លាប់កូនប្រុសខ្លួនឯង។

307
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:09,405
កូនប្រុស​របស់​នាង?

308
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:12,875
ម៉ាក់មានក្មេងប្រុសចំលែកម្នាក់នៅក្នុងថ្នាក់ខ្ញុំ។

309
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:15,786
គាត់បានទន្សាយទន្សាយ។

310
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:20,286
ខ្ញុំត្រូវប្រាកដថាដូច្នេះខ្ញុំបានទៅផ្ទះរបស់អ្នក។

311
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:23,996
មើលមួយគឺអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំត្រូវការ។

312
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:49,806
តើ​អ្នក​មិន​អី​ទេ​ឬ?

313
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:52,615
ទៅផ្ទះ។ រត់ទៅផ្ទះឥឡូវនេះ!

314
00:30:52,615 --> 00:30:53,945
ម៉ាក់!

315
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,855
នេះ។

316
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,256
ស្លាប់។ បិសាចដូចជាអ្នកត្រូវការស្លាប់។

317
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:05,925
អ្នកបិសាច។

318
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:09,766
ខ្ញុំមិនគួរផ្តល់កំណើតឱ្យអ្នកទេ។

319
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:14,566
ខ្ញុំមិនគួរផ្តល់កំណើតឱ្យអ្នក។

320
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,806
នោះមិនមែនជាសុបិនទេ។

321
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,076
អ្នកគួរតែសម្លាប់ខ្ញុំពេលនោះ។

322
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:25,046
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនធ្វើដូច្នេះ?

323
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,016
ហេតុអ្វី?

324
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:29,816
ហេតុនេះ​ហើយ...

325
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,885
យើងប្តូរកូនរបស់យើង។

326
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:37,855
ខ្ញុំជេមីន?

327
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:42,165
ប៉ុន្តែគាត់មិនបាននិយាយអ្វីទាំងអស់។

328
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,095
គាត់ប្រហែលជាភ័យខ្លាចខ្លាំងពេក។

329
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:47,306
ខ្ញុំបានឃើញគាត់។

330
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,165
គាត់បានព្យាយាមកប់បងប្រុសរបស់គាត់។

331
00:31:53,135 --> 00:31:54,205
អ្នកចាំទេ ...

332
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,345
ការសន្យារបស់យើងមែនទេ?

333
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:01,185
ប្រសិនបើ Jae Hoon មិនត្រូវបានបញ្ឈប់

334
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:03,216
គាត់នឹងបញ្ចប់ការសម្លាប់ប្អូនប្រុសរបស់គាត់។

335
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,316
ដូច្នេះ​សូម,

336
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:08,155
សម្រាប់ជាប្រយោជន៍របស់ Jae Hoon ។

337
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:11,226
អ្នកប្រហែលជាគិតហើយ ...

338
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,026
ដែលខ្ញុំបានសម្លាប់គ្រួសាររបស់ខ្ញុំ។

339
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:15,665
ត្រូវហើយ។

340
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,336
ខ្ញុំបានស្វែងរកអ្នកចេញ ...

341
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,905
សម្លាប់អ្នកដោយខ្លួនឯង

342
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:25,675
ប៉ុន្តែម្តាយមីងរបស់អ្នកបាននាំអ្នកទៅហើយ។

343
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,776
ខ្ញុំបានរកអ្នកនៅគ្រប់ទីកន្លែង

344
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,175
ប៉ុន្តែគ្មានប្រយោជន៍ទេ។

345
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:35,086
នៅពេលខ្ញុំដឹងថាលេខអត្តសញ្ញាណប័ណ្ណរបស់អ្នកបានផុតកំណត់

346
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:37,615
ខ្ញុំ​បាន​បួងសួង...

347
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:41,986
ពីព្រោះអ្នកលែងរស់។

348
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,996
ហើយដូច្នេះខ្ញុំភ្លេចអ្នកបន្តិចម្តង ៗ ។

349
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:49,566
ស្ត្រីម្នាក់មានអាយុជាង ៧០ ឆ្នាំត្រូវបានគេរកឃើញនៅយប់នេះ…

00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,336
ចាក់ដល់ស្លាប់ដោយរបួសជាច្រើនកន្លែង…

351
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:55,466
នៅក្នុងផ្ទះទំនេរមួយនៅក្នុងភូមិហ្គូដុងស្រុកអភិវឌ្ឍន៍។

352
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:57,935
ប៉ូលីសជឿជាក់ថានេះត្រូវបានប្រព្រឹត្តដោយ ...

353
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,336
បិសាចដូចជាអ្នកត្រូវការស្លាប់។

354
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,705
អ្នកបិសាច។

355
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,246
ខ្ញុំមិនគួរផ្តល់កំណើតឱ្យអ្នកទេ។

356
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,615
ខ្ញុំមិនគួរផ្តល់កំណើតឱ្យអ្នក។

357
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:12,615
ដូច្នេះមានជនរងគ្រោះចំនួន ៦ នាក់ត្រូវបានសម្លាប់ដោយឃាតករសៀរៀល។

358
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,256
ខ្ញុំដឹងថាវាជាអ្នក។

359
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:17,095
នោះត្រូវតែឈឺចាប់។

360
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:21,695
តើគាត់អាចធ្វើយ៉ាងម៉េចចំពោះមុខរបស់ក្មេង?

361
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:23,935
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នករៀបការជាមួយខ្ញុំ?

362
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:25,935
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នករៀបការជាមួយខ្ញុំពេលដែលអ្នកមិនស្រឡាញ់ខ្ញុំ?

363
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:29,236
ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកអាចហៅវាបាន ...

364
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,236
ឆន្ទៈរបស់ខ្ញុំដើម្បីបង្កើតឡើងវិញ។

365
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,645
ខ្ញុំត្រូវការកូនចៅ។

366
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:40,415
អាហានសៅជូន័រ។

367
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:43,515
វារំmeកខ្ញុំពីខ្លួនខ្ញុំនិងហានសៅជុន។

368
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,455
ត្រឡប់មកវិញពេលខ្ញុំស្រលាញ់គាត់

369
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:49,055
ត្រូវបានគេ clueless ដូចដែលគាត់ជា។

370
00:34:00,566 --> 00:34:01,636
តើ​អ្នក​មិន​អី​ទេ​ឬ?

371
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,935
ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនចាត់វិធានការ?

372
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,046
មុនពេលដែលខ្ញុំអាចធ្វើបាន

373
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,245
យ៉ូហានបានរកឃើញអ្នកមុន។

374
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,446
យូហាន ...

375
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:20,055
បន្ទាប់ពីបញ្ជូនគាត់ទៅ

376
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,185
ខ្ញុំបានទៅបន្ទប់មន្ទីរពេទ្យរបស់អ្នក ...

377
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:26,125
ដើម្បីបញ្ចប់វាម្តងនិងសម្រាប់ទាំងអស់។

378
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,035
តើបក្សីនៅឯណា?

379
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,575
តើខ្ញុំនៅឯណា?

380
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:17,145
បារាម។ បារាម!

381
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,645
(ការឈប់សំរាកដាច់ខាត)

382
00:35:25,515 --> 00:35:26,555
អ្នក​ជា​នរណា?

383
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:42,265
មន្រ្តីជុងធ្វើដំណើរទៅផ្ទះនៅថ្ងៃនេះបន្ទាប់ពីបានជាសះស្បើយពីការវះកាត់ចំនួន ៣ ។

384
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,805
នេះបើតាមការបញ្ជាក់ពីក្រុមគ្រូពេទ្យរបស់គាត់នៅមន្ទីរពេទ្យសាកលវិទ្យាល័យមូម៉ាជី។

385
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:46,535
គាត់បានជាសះស្បើយពេញលេញ។

386
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,906
ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយគាត់កំពុងទទួលរងពីការភ្លេចភ្លាំងតាមមូលដ្ឋាន ...

387
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:50,645
ដោយសារតែការភ្ញាក់ផ្អើលនៃការវាយប្រហារ។

388
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,546
ខ្ញុំបានទៅផ្ទះដែលអ្នកបានរើទៅ

389
00:35:57,915 --> 00:35:59,086
ហើយអ្នកហាក់ដូចជា ...

390
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:02,256
ដូចជាមនុស្សដែលមានចិត្តល្អ។

391
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,426
ខ្ញុំបានឃ្លាំមើលអ្នកតាំងពីថ្ងៃនោះតទៅ ...

392
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,125
ហើយសកម្មភាពរបស់អ្នកធ្វើអោយខ្ញុំមានសង្ឃឹម។

393
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,596
ថាប្រហែលជា ... ប្រហែលជា ...

394
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,435
អ្នកអាចផ្លាស់ប្តូរ។

395
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:16,265
វាជាមូលហេតុដែល ...

396
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:19,836
នោះ​ហើយ​ជា​មូល​ហេតុ​ដែល...

397
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:25,975
ដល់​ខ្ញុំ,

398
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:31,086
ហានសៅជូនហើយអ្នកគឺម្នាក់ ...

399
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:33,285
និងដូចគ្នា។

400
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:45,566
ដល់ពេលដែលអ្នកត្រូវសាកសួរហើយ។

401
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:50,875
ខ្ញុំដឹងថារឿងនេះនឹងមិនផ្លាស់ប្តូរអ្វីទាំងអស់

402
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,176
ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនបានព្យាយាមសម្លាប់ Jae Min នៅថ្ងៃនោះទេ។

403
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,645
ហើយគ្រួសារខ្ញុំ ...

404
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:03,515
មិនមែនខ្ញុំទេដែលបានសម្លាប់ពួកគេ។

405
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:58,676
ទេអ្នកក៏គួរចាប់ខ្ញុំដែរ។

406
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:00,535
ខ្ញុំបានសម្លាប់បុរសម្នាក់។

407
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:03,446
ខ្ញុំបានសម្លាប់បុរសស្លូតត្រង់ម្នាក់ដើម្បីជួយសង្រ្គោះសត្វចម្លែកនោះ។

408
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:04,875
- ប៉ុន្តែ ... - ចាប់ខ្ញុំ។

409
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,645
- អ្នកស៊ើបអង្កេត ... - ខ្ញុំបានសម្លាប់បុរសស្លូតត្រង់ម្នាក់!

410
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,245
- វា​គ្រប់គ្រាន់​ហើយ។ - បញ្ឈប់ការនេះ។

411
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:16,555
- ឈប់! - ចាប់គាត់។

412
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:18,395
ឆាប់​ឡើង។

413
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:19,455
យកគាត់។

414
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,495
ចេញទៅ។

415
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:25,995
នៅទីនោះ។

416
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:34,152
តើអ្នកបានបាញ់គាត់ទេ?

417
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:38,293
យូហានក្រីក្ររបស់ខ្ញុំ។ ក្មេងកំសត់…

418
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:40,793
តើអ្នកបានបាញ់គាត់ទេ?

419
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:50,333
យ៉ូហានខ្ញុំ ...

420
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:53,373
អ្នកមិនមែនជាមនុស្សដែលបានយកជីវិតរបស់គាត់,

421
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:56,643
ដូច្នេះមិនចាំបាច់មានអារម្មណ៍ថាមានកំហុសទេ។

422
00:38:59,112 --> 00:39:00,783
ហានសៅជុនគឺជាអ្នកដែលបានសម្លាប់គាត់។

423
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:03,482
វាមិនមែនជាអ្នកទេ។

424
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:07,183
Han Seo Joon has a hideout there.

425
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:08,752
You should check for yourselves.

426
00:39:09,752 --> 00:39:13,462
That's it. That's what caused...

427
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:15,263
Ba Reum to change.

428
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,789
Is it true? Is she telling the truth?

429
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,789
Whom?

430
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,429
Sung Ji Eun?

431
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:57,099
Is Jung Ba Reum your son?

432
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,699
Is that why you implanted Yo Han's brain into Ba Reum's...

433
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,269
even though he was still alive?

434
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,610
Yes, it's all true.

435
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:15,019
How was that even possible? You're a death-row convict.

436
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,949
There's nothing...

437
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,019
Choi Young Shin can't do in this country.

438
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,860
She even knelt before me.

439
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:26,929
She told me everyone in the country is praying for him to recover.

440
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,099
She asked me to save the national son.

441
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:46,679
Why do you think she knelt before you to save Ba Reum?

442
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,920
I thought you were a genius, but you're just as dumb as I am.

443
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:54,119
She completely used you and your son.

444
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:56,889
You just wait.

445
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,460
Your son will soon get disposed miserably.

446
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,539
Choi Young Shin.

447
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,610
That wench.

448
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,949
You want to know when I found out?

449
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,470
You monster.

450
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,869
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

451
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,869
- I shouldn't have... - I told myself it couldn't be true.

452
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,679
I tried not to believe it...

453
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,240
even though I was abused for being a murderer's son.

454
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,949
Yo Han, please bring me my beige coat.

455
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:15,470
That day, I saw a photo of you holding some other baby.

456
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,970
So I took a specimen of your DNA and Han Seo Joon's...

457
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,679
to request a DNA test.

458
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,579
You should've called before you came.

459
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:30,619
What is it, sweetheart?

460
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,550
You knew, didn't you?

461
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,659
Knew what?

462
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,070
That your son is a murderer.

463
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,570
How...

464
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,240
How could you do this?

465
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,349
Yo Han...

466
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,249
Yo Han.

467
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:06,420
Yo Han, I'm sorry.

468
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:10,190
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

469
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,190
Let go of me.

470
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,559
You're no different.

471
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:17,300
You're just the same as your husband and son.

472
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:21,199
I won't ever forgive your son for killing my family...

473
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,769
and for brutally killing my one and only friend, Joon Sung.

474
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,110
And I won't forgive you for staying quiet...

475
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,309
even though you knew everything.

476
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:34,650
I'm going to kill your son today.

477
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,920
I'll kill him myself. You just wait and see.

478
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,960
No! No, Yo Han! Don't!

479
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:46,030
He's... He's a monster.

480
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,030
- Get out of my way. - You'll die.

481
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,530
You'll die too!

482
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,729
I said get out of my way!

483
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:53,630
Yo Han!

484
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:07,749
I brought the receipts...

485
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:19,659
Ms. Sung! Ms. Sung, wake up!

486
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,059
I didn't have the courage to tell you the truth.

487
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,999
I was scared you might hate and resent me.

488
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,369
My poor son, Yo Han.

489
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,539
You probably think I'm a terrible person.

490
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:38,809
But I want to be...

491
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,619
by your side.

492
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,400
Is Professor Lee still pleading the Fifth?

493
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,409
Yes. I don't get why he won't say anything when he's also a victim.

494
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,740
We won't get an arrest warrant if he refuses to speak.

495
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,849
The Blue House is getting involved, so it won't be easy to arrest her.

496
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,349
The presidential election is coming up too,

497
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:15,550
so they'll try their best to keep it quiet.

498
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,590
Exactly. Even if we file for an arrest warrant,

499
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,820
they'll reject it right away.

500
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,990
We'll just have to wait...

501
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,360
and hope Professor Lee testifies against her.

502
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:28,360
Increase the volume.

503
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,260
Is that Choi Young Shin's lawyer doing an interview?

504
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:33,900
My client doesn't know how that laptop...

505
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,440
and victims' belongings ended up at her house.

506
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,840
I'm sure Jung Ba Reum left it there on purpose.

507
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,240
I knew he'd say that.

508
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,809
- What is this? - What was that?

509
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,579
- What is this? - "OZ"?

510
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:46,780
What's that?

511
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,349
Hey, look at this. If we're lucky,

512
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,090
the tables might turn.

513
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,220
We have breaking news.

514
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,059
A, who confessed to have been a member...

515
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,789
of a private organization in the NIS,

516
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:00,130
- asked for a press interview... - She announced that she will...

517
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,999
disclose the shocking truth regarding a secret...

518
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,760
that the chief secretary has been keeping from us for 26 years.

519
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:06,869
What if Choi Young Shin finds a way out after I turn myself in?

520
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,340
Don't worry. This will prevent her from doing that.

521
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,639
Hoon Suk's father is on his way to pick him up.

522
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:17,809
I'll do a press interview as soon as he gets on a plane.

523
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,519
My gosh, what's going on?

524
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,249
- I hope we get something. - Exactly.

525
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,059
- I know. - What's it about?

526
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,590
- I wonder what's going on. - I don't know.

527
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,889
- I guess it's something shocking. - Let's hear her out.

528
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,099
It's been 30 minutes. Why is she so late?

529
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,170
Excuse me. Detective Kang.

530
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,729
Captain!

531
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:54,052
The darn father killed my parents.

532
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:56,422
And that son killed my brother.

533
00:46:57,163 --> 00:46:59,993
I'll kill you. I swear.

534
00:47:02,902 --> 00:47:05,402
Detective, you need to find my aunt first.

535
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:08,172
There's no time. In order to clear Sung Yo Han's name...

536
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,402
Brain implant and lab rats?

537
00:47:10,473 --> 00:47:12,143
It sounds like a science fiction story.

538
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:13,913
My client is very dumbfounded by all the rumors.

539
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:16,413
Sung Yo Han and Jung Ba Reum...

540
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:19,382
are both psychopaths and murderers. That's the fact.

541
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:23,083
My aunt has evidence that can prove everything.

542
00:47:31,063 --> 00:47:32,433
Can you zoom in on this?

543
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:40,273
Track down Detective Lee's cell. I'll go check his place.

544
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:49,716
- Hey, Ki Hyuk. - His cell phone's turned off.

545
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,185
I can't track his location.

546
00:47:54,696 --> 00:47:58,826
(Special Task Force HQ)

547
00:48:01,596 --> 00:48:07,366
(Interrogation Room)

548
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:09,035
They already took action.

549
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:11,406
But it's weird.

550
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:12,776
What is?

551
00:48:12,776 --> 00:48:14,176
Choi Young Shin's side.

552
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,875
They look grim.

553
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,245
Lee Min Soo's missing?

554
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:18,745
What do you mean?

555
00:48:19,616 --> 00:48:22,816
Didn't you say he called and said he was bringing her?

556
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:26,526
Yes, he did. But we can't reach him anymore.

557
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:31,495
Find him right now.

558
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:32,966
I'll keep looking.

559
00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:34,196
Where?

560
00:48:34,196 --> 00:48:35,495
I have to do something.

561
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:38,966
Captain. I have to clear Sung Yo Han's name.

562
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:40,805
I have to.

563
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,375
She's still not here.

564
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:45,506
Let's go.

565
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,176
Forget it. Let's go.

566
00:48:51,446 --> 00:48:52,716
How did you find me?

567
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:54,245
Please.

568
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:56,386
I already promised Ba Reum.

569
00:48:57,256 --> 00:49:00,386
I'm going to hold a press conference with the evidence that I have.

570
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:03,625
Ba Reum went to turn himself in.

571
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:04,995
I have a favor to ask.

572
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:06,696
I'm going to change the item tomorrow unannounced.

573
00:49:06,895 --> 00:49:08,096
I need your help.

574
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,066
I need ironclad security.

575
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:13,506
You're the only person I can trust right now.

576
00:49:14,906 --> 00:49:17,205
These are the files that I've gathered so far.

577
00:49:17,406 --> 00:49:18,446
Look through them and then decide.

578
00:49:36,227 --> 00:49:39,156
I'll do it. Someone has to.

579
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:42,526
As you saw, we don't have the smoking gun.

580
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:44,127
But let's try to get an arrest warrant.

581
00:49:55,107 --> 00:49:56,147
Excuse me.

582
00:49:56,477 --> 00:49:57,506
Hello.

583
00:49:58,477 --> 00:50:01,147
- The house across the way... - Choi Young Shin was arrested,

584
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:04,486
and the police have 48 hours to charge her.

585
00:50:04,656 --> 00:50:07,017
Given this unprecedented event,

586
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:10,256
they are focusing all efforts on having her charged.

587
00:50:11,026 --> 00:50:12,656
We have to request a warrant soon.

588
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:16,696
Moo Chi still hasn't found Min Soo?

589
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:18,366
No. I haven't heard from him.

590
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:20,667
If the police fail to charge her,

591
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,636
it'll be very difficult for them...

592
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,207
to find the people involved higher up.

593
00:50:28,477 --> 00:50:29,506
Min Soo.

594
00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:40,517
They found Lee Min Soo.

595
00:50:59,107 --> 00:51:01,077
Yes. I'm leaving now.

596
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:02,747
Yes.

597
00:51:08,586 --> 00:51:09,586
Did you find her?

598
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:11,586
We can't reach Moo Chi.

599
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:14,216
It's time for your interview with the profiler.

600
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:21,127
I'm Choi Hong Ju of "Sherlock Hong Ju".

601
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:25,037
"I'm the real Moojin Serial Killer."

602
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,196
"I'm a serial killer."

603
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,906
Jung Ba Reum's confession has shocked the nation.

604
00:51:31,107 --> 00:51:33,977
Tell me about the first murder. Why did you kill him?

605
00:51:34,506 --> 00:51:36,776
I had been searching for Song Soo Ho for years.

606
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:40,247
He killed my family.

607
00:51:41,886 --> 00:51:44,247
That was my first murder.

608
00:51:44,716 --> 00:51:46,057
When I killed him,

609
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:49,086
it awoke the murderer inside of me.

610
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:52,327
- After that... - Commissioner.

611
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:56,097
What's more shocking than Jung Ba Reum's murders...

612
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,897
is the fact that there was someone...

613
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:01,236
who knew of his crimes, covered them up,

614
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:03,966
and actually induced him to commit the murders.

615
00:52:04,736 --> 00:52:06,006
Dr. Daniel Lee said...

616
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:11,316
Sung Yo Han and I were both born with the psychopath gene.

617
00:52:12,977 --> 00:52:14,247
Choi Young Shin...

618
00:52:15,486 --> 00:52:18,457
observed us to see whether or not we grew up...

619
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:21,017
to be...

620
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:23,127
psychopathic murderers.

621
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:25,397
I'll escort you out.

622
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:31,667
Wait. It hasn't been 48 hours yet.

623
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:33,267
Then request a warrant.

624
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:36,537
You can't request a warrant because you have no evidence.

625
00:52:36,537 --> 00:52:38,207
All you have is that lunatic's word.

626
00:52:38,636 --> 00:52:41,136
If you won't request a warrant, don't keep her in here.

627
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:43,147
She's a busy woman doing the nation's work.

628
00:52:43,147 --> 00:52:44,776
Why the hurry?

629
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:46,147
We still have five minutes.

630
00:52:47,577 --> 00:52:48,787
Any word from Moo Chi?

631
00:52:51,616 --> 00:52:54,357
Choi Young Shin used the national government to run...

632
00:52:54,357 --> 00:52:57,227
an illegal surveillance on two children and their families.

633
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:58,597
That was possible...

634
00:52:58,597 --> 00:53:01,296
because she was powerful enough...

635
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:03,426
to order around high-ranking officials.

636
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:04,767
Captain Bok!

637
00:53:05,336 --> 00:53:06,397
Yes, sir.

638
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:09,406
What are you doing? Step aside.

639
00:53:09,506 --> 00:53:11,136
We still have a minute.

640
00:53:11,136 --> 00:53:13,776
Darn you, Ho Nam. Let her out.

641
00:53:13,977 --> 00:53:15,946
Okay, we'll request the warrant.

642
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:17,776
Yes, sir.

643
00:53:22,787 --> 00:53:24,247
(Arrest Warrant Request)

644
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:36,526
- Hello? - It's been rejected.

645
00:53:37,196 --> 00:53:39,767
What garbage. You didn't have time to even open the email.

646
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:41,437
He didn't even review it.

647
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:46,577
Thank you for your service.

648
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,417
The murderer Jung Ba Reum's statements...

649
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:58,156
and that of Choi Young Shin, chief secretary to the president,

650
00:53:58,156 --> 00:53:59,486
are in direct conflict.

651
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:03,526
However, I learned that the warrant for the arrest...

652
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:06,397
of Woo Hyung Chul, the Rope Knot Serial Killer,

653
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:09,066
was suddenly rejected.

654
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:11,026
I asked for the reason.

655
00:54:11,196 --> 00:54:12,366
I have nothing to say.

656
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:15,836
Two more women were killed since the warrant was rejected.

657
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:17,307
Don't you regret it?

658
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:18,377
Don't blame me.

659
00:54:18,577 --> 00:54:20,006
Do you think I wanted to reject it?

660
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,676
The order came down from above.

661
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:24,377
I was demoted and sent here because I argued against it.

662
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:26,517
We got an order from above.

663
00:54:26,616 --> 00:54:28,917
They used all these big words about the public...

664
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,247
being traumatized.

665
00:54:30,616 --> 00:54:32,116
It's weird when you think about it.

666
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:35,386
We can't go public because the higher-ups...

667
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:37,426
tell us to keep quiet.

668
00:54:38,127 --> 00:54:39,727
That's not me.

669
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,566
He's nothing like me.

670
00:54:42,227 --> 00:54:44,327
- He looks exactly like you. - Quiet.

671
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:47,397
Why did you deny the arrest warrant?

672
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:48,866
Did you order that the arrest warrant be denied?

673
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:51,437
Woo Hyung Chul's arrest warrant was denied as expected.

674
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:54,776
The organization even staged his crime scenes...

675
00:54:54,776 --> 00:54:57,006
to make it look like it was a copycat killer.

676
00:54:57,707 --> 00:54:58,747
Why?

677
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:01,316
That is an absurd accusation. That's stretching it.

678
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:03,917
Even if she did deny Woo Hyung Chul's arrest warrant,

679
00:55:04,046 --> 00:55:06,287
how does that mean she induced Jung Ba Reum to murder?

680
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:07,687
Are you saying she controlled him?

681
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:11,727
In 1995, when the nation was in an uproar...

682
00:55:12,057 --> 00:55:13,696
about the Head Hunter murders,

683
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:17,366
legislators met to discuss...

684
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:22,006
legalizing fetuses with the psychopath gene.

685
00:55:22,207 --> 00:55:24,236
- Hey! - If you have something to say...

686
00:55:24,236 --> 00:55:26,836
- How could this happen? - I didn't say anything wrong.

687
00:55:26,836 --> 00:55:30,207
When the bill was rejected, Choi Young Shin came to me...

688
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:34,216
and asked me for a list of fetuses with the psychopath gene.

689
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:37,886
And I obliged.

690
00:55:41,116 --> 00:55:42,787
Jung Ba Reum, Sung Yo Han,

691
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:45,827
and the child who was born already with the psychopath gene,

692
00:55:45,827 --> 00:55:47,127
Woo Hyung Chul.

693
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:49,966
I went to her and told her to stop.

694
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:51,097
But she said...

695
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,066
The more people Jung Ba Reum kills,

696
00:55:53,336 --> 00:55:55,506
the more the people will be enraged.

697
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:56,636
You're crazy.

698
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,207
You need to stop this now.

699
00:55:58,336 --> 00:56:00,136
He's out of control right now.

700
00:56:00,236 --> 00:56:01,236
A little later.

701
00:56:01,336 --> 00:56:02,906
The presidential election is coming up.

702
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:04,247
Wait until then.

703
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,347
I'll get that law passed.

704
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:08,247
I never received any such document.

705
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:10,787
Dr. Daniel Lee is making an unfounded claim.

706
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:13,357
Is Dr. Daniel Lee really making an unfounded claim?

707
00:56:14,256 --> 00:56:17,687
Are Jung Ba Reum and Dr. Lee lying about all of this?

708
00:56:18,756 --> 00:56:21,057
It's the truth. All of it.

709
00:56:30,566 --> 00:56:31,707
They found her.

710
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:33,437
They did it.

711
00:56:34,577 --> 00:56:36,347
They already took action.

712
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:39,316
Choi Young Shin's side.

713
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:40,917
They look grim.

714
00:56:41,716 --> 00:56:43,147
I think they lost Detective Lee.

715
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:46,017
He was the kidnapper, but they lost him?

716
00:56:46,116 --> 00:56:47,357
I'll keep looking.

717
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:51,627
There's a picture.

718
00:56:52,526 --> 00:56:53,997
In Detective Lee's home.

719
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:56,897
It was with that OZ we chased in the motel.

720
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:58,997
That 6264 OZ?

721
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:01,236
Yes. It was a picture of him, some woman...

722
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:03,767
and Detective Lee.

723
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:06,437
If Detective Lee didn't take my aunt to Choi Young Shin,

724
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:08,377
there must be a reason.

725
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:10,676
Yu Jung was stalked for seven years...

726
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:13,147
and killed by a man disguised as a delivery man.

727
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:16,946
Do you know him too?

728
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:19,517
Min Soo.

729
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:22,526
Min Soo and Yu Jung were inseparable during high school.

730
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,457
I see.

731
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:31,327
Do you know where Yu Jung's ashes were spread?

732
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:39,477
Min Soo!

733
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:45,577
You jerk. Where's the child and his mom?

734
00:57:46,147 --> 00:57:48,116
You jerk. Don't tell me...

735
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:54,116
Who's that man, Mommy?

736
00:57:54,116 --> 00:57:55,357
Don't scold him.

737
00:57:55,526 --> 00:57:57,627
He said he'd take us to the TV station.

738
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:01,026
I'm sorry.

739
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:03,264
She said it was to make a world...

740
00:58:03,264 --> 00:58:04,604
where people didn't have to die like Yu Jung.

741
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:08,204
Shall we?

742
00:58:10,943 --> 00:58:12,814
Mister, you startled me!

743
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:17,983
A show's airing today? Shouldn't this be a secret?

744
00:58:18,483 --> 00:58:20,553
You know I trust you.

745
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:22,184
And I trust you too.

746
00:58:23,383 --> 00:58:24,584
It's why I brought them here.

747
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,394
I can't trust the police at this moment.

748
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:37,064
After joining the NIS in 2005, I was first stationed...

749
00:58:37,334 --> 00:58:40,403
with the black-ops team OZ formed by Choi Young Shin.

750
00:58:41,273 --> 00:58:44,744
When Song Soo Ho murdered Jung Ba Reum's entire family,

751
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:47,173
I stepped in as Ba Reum's aunt.

752
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:50,883
Moo Chi and Ba Reum worked together one last time.

753
00:58:51,544 --> 00:58:54,584
From that moment on, my mission was...

754
00:58:54,983 --> 00:58:56,383
to observe and report Ba Reum's actions.

755
00:58:56,923 --> 00:58:58,354
Well, this...

756
00:58:58,553 --> 00:58:59,954
I do not know this woman.

757
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:03,363
Do you have evidence that backs your claims?

758
00:59:04,224 --> 00:59:05,934
I assure you that this isn't true.

759
00:59:07,034 --> 00:59:10,463
This contains all the evidence you need.

760
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:15,644
("Sherlock Hong Ju")

761
00:59:16,773 --> 00:59:18,073
(Choi Young Shin)

762
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:21,173
(Choi Young Shin's private organization OZ)

763
00:59:29,323 --> 00:59:32,494
(Photos of victims right after they were murdered by Jung Ba Reum)

764
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:35,494
I have never seen them before. These were all fabricated.

765
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,894
Has he still not made a move?

766
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:44,104
Text Song Soo Ho's address to Jung Ba Reum.

767
00:59:47,403 --> 00:59:48,544
Sorry?

768
00:59:49,104 --> 00:59:50,443
Song Soo Ho's address?

769
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:52,673
Let's bait him.

770
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:56,213
How many has Jung Ba Reum killed so far?

771
00:59:56,483 --> 00:59:58,483
The vineyard victim makes five.

772
00:59:58,684 --> 00:59:59,954
It's still not enough.

773
01:00:00,553 --> 01:00:01,854
We'll wait until the presidential election.

774
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,794
- What was that? - Can you explain?

775
01:00:09,863 --> 01:00:12,034
- Give us your explanation. - Any words?

776
01:00:12,034 --> 01:00:13,463
Arrest Choi Young Shin!

777
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:14,894
- Sure. - Yes, sir.

778
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:35,823
I'm afraid there's more than evidence on you.

779
01:00:37,653 --> 01:00:38,854
Please step out.

780
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:42,224
Get out of the car.

781
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:45,133
Come on.

782
01:00:51,334 --> 01:00:53,334
I bought these as a gift for Detective Shin's baby,

783
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:56,773
but he never got around to tell me that it was a girl.

784
01:00:58,673 --> 01:01:00,773
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

785
01:01:00,843 --> 01:01:02,144
Anything you say can and will...

786
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:04,514
Why didn't you come forward sooner?

787
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:06,314
There isn't a government office...

788
01:01:06,684 --> 01:01:09,053
that is free from Choi Young Shin's reach.

789
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:12,093
I'm sure that's why Sung Yo Han...

790
01:01:12,153 --> 01:01:14,224
sought out Jung Ba Reum himself.

791
01:01:18,547 --> 01:01:21,317
Then, was Sung Yo Han truly innocent?

792
01:01:21,788 --> 01:01:25,357
Or was he a heinous killer just like Jung Ba Reum?

793
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:29,058
The grateful one who gave me back...

794
01:01:29,127 --> 01:01:30,357
the will to live.

795
01:01:30,757 --> 01:01:32,328
I'm not telling you to forgive him.

796
01:01:32,828 --> 01:01:35,268
But until he kneels and begs for your forgiveness,

797
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:37,567
you should stay alive.

798
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:40,538
I'm talking about Doctor Sung Yo Han.

799
01:01:40,538 --> 01:01:43,538
I was at the brink of death and he carried me to the police.

800
01:01:43,678 --> 01:01:45,948
That young boy was Sung Yo Han.

801
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:48,477
Choi Young Shin tried to have me killed,

802
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:52,618
but Dr. Sung saved me and nursed me back to health.

803
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:56,558
While putting together this episode, I came across...

804
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,257
a recorded video.

805
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:07,928
(Sung Yo Han, 1 year ago, a few hours before he died)

806
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,238
I'll look forward to what you have to tell me tonight.

807
01:02:11,738 --> 01:02:13,138
Are you perhaps going to propose?

808
01:02:13,908 --> 01:02:16,678
I made lunch for you, so enjoy and see you later.

809
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:59,348
(Sung Yo Han, 1 year ago, a few hours before he died)

810
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:13,527
Daniel Lee told me...

811
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:17,937
that psychopaths never put on an act when they're alone.

812
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:20,268
(There's no scripted outro, so say whatever you want.)

813
01:03:26,948 --> 01:03:28,007
I'm also...

814
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:31,078
hugely involved in this case.

815
01:03:32,488 --> 01:03:33,488
I suggested to Daniel Lee...

816
01:03:33,488 --> 01:03:35,257
that we take advantage of Jung Ba Reum.

817
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:40,227
When he told me the truth about Jung Ba Reum,

818
01:03:40,288 --> 01:03:42,598
instead of reporting him to the police,

819
01:03:42,658 --> 01:03:45,297
I used him to kill psychopaths...

820
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:47,768
such as Kang Duk Soo.

821
01:03:49,268 --> 01:03:52,468
Once this show ends, I'll pay for what I did...

822
01:03:52,968 --> 01:03:55,167
and fully cooperate with the police's investigation.

823
01:03:58,808 --> 01:03:59,808
Here she comes!

824
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:01,507
Were you directly involved in the killings?

825
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:03,877
How did you conspire with Daniel Lee?

826
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:05,848
Do you have anything to say?

827
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:07,018
- Go ahead. - Any words?

828
01:04:09,018 --> 01:04:11,187
- I am a killer. - What?

829
01:04:12,788 --> 01:04:16,098
26 years ago, I killed a person.

830
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:18,627
Excuse me.

831
01:04:23,937 --> 01:04:25,908
My daddy...

832
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:28,337
Where's your dad?

833
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,277
Excuse me. Sir.

834
01:04:36,178 --> 01:04:38,377
Sir. Sir?

835
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:45,558
Please, don't kill me.

836
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:48,457
No, please.

837
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,227
Help.

838
01:04:59,368 --> 01:05:01,238
I've lived with the guilt all my life.

839
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:05,308
I truly apologize to Soo Jung's mother.

840
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:06,908
(Choi Hong Ju's Shocking Confession, Deeply Involved in Jung's Murders)

841
01:05:24,757 --> 01:05:26,768
- Detective Kang. - Yes?

842
01:05:27,998 --> 01:05:29,198
Let me arrest her.

843
01:06:01,868 --> 01:06:03,738
It took you a long time to come home.

844
01:06:10,538 --> 01:06:11,738
Dad, I'm sorry.

845
01:06:13,408 --> 01:06:16,748
After what I did to Soo Jung,

846
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,848
I couldn't let myself be happy.

847
01:06:53,717 --> 01:06:54,788
Let's go.

848
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:07,198
Dad, where's Mom? Isn't she coming with us?

849
01:07:07,267 --> 01:07:09,868
She told us to go first and wait for her.

850
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:13,807
What was your motive?

851
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:16,238
The organization known as OZ has come out of the shadows.

852
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:18,008
Chief Presidential Secretary Choi Young Shin...

853
01:07:18,008 --> 01:07:19,107
formed a black-ops team...

854
01:07:19,408 --> 01:07:21,807
in the name of creating a crimeless world.

855
01:07:21,878 --> 01:07:23,448
Civilians were under surveillance...

856
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,847
and murder was commissioned in the process.

857
01:07:27,147 --> 01:07:28,788
The people are raising their voices...

858
01:07:28,788 --> 01:07:30,017
for a thorough investigation...

859
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,887
into the private organization that was motivated by personal greed.

860
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,998
Candidate Shin Sung Min was elected president...

861
01:07:39,998 --> 01:07:41,628
in the 20th presidential election.

862
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:44,798
I thank the people for placing...

863
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:46,807
their sacred votes with me.

864
01:07:48,408 --> 01:07:50,508
My late son Sang...

865
01:07:51,508 --> 01:07:52,878
would've loved this the most.

866
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:54,607
(Shin Sung Min Elected as 20th President)

867
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,647
26 years ago, I dismissed a certain bill...

868
01:07:56,647 --> 01:07:58,017
that came to my attention.

869
01:07:58,548 --> 01:08:00,048
But today, I announce that...

870
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:02,488
I will let the people vote whether or not...

871
01:08:02,488 --> 01:08:04,887
we should legally abort fetuses with psychopath genes.

872
01:08:06,158 --> 01:08:07,758
(Execute Jung Ba Reum, the murderer!)

873
01:08:12,933 --> 01:08:14,092
(You're just like your father!)

874
01:08:14,092 --> 01:08:15,603
(The only solution is to execute Jung Ba Reum!)

875
01:08:17,903 --> 01:08:19,603
The infamous serial killer, Jung Ba Reum,

876
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:21,233
will be having his first trial today.

877
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:24,672
The trial hasn't even started yet, but you can already see...

878
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:27,242
many funeral wreaths in front of Moojin Police Agency...

879
01:08:27,242 --> 01:08:29,483
that were presumably sent by the citizens.

880
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,613
The citizens have finished casting their votes...

881
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:36,422
regarding whether or not there should be a law...

882
01:08:36,422 --> 01:08:38,153
to abort fetuses with psychopath genes.

883
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:42,023
Based on the vote count, the government passed the bill...

884
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:43,693
to abort fetuses with psychopath genes.

885
01:08:43,693 --> 01:08:45,462
Execute Jung Ba Reum!

886
01:08:45,462 --> 01:08:49,462
The prosecution requested Jung Ba Reum to be executed,

887
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:50,863
and his first hearing will be held today at 3pm.

888
01:08:51,032 --> 01:08:52,773
People are more interested to find out...

889
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:55,742
how long of a sentence Jung Ba Reum will receive...

890
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:57,372
and on what grounds...

891
01:08:57,372 --> 01:08:59,513
the judges will base that sentence on,

892
01:08:59,513 --> 01:09:02,882
which is why many people have tuned in to watch the live hearing.

893
01:09:03,483 --> 01:09:06,013
I sentence the defendant, Jung Ba Reum, to death.

894
01:09:09,252 --> 01:09:10,622
The serial killer, Jung Ba Reum,

895
01:09:10,622 --> 01:09:12,723
got sentenced to death on his first trial.

896
01:09:12,992 --> 01:09:16,422
The court announced that he should be isolated forever...

897
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:19,332
considering the unimaginable pain he gave to the victims.

898
01:09:19,592 --> 01:09:22,462
Jung Ba Reum, who was once known as the national son,

899
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:25,733
shocked the entire country by confessing he was the culprit...

900
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:28,132
behind the Moojin serial murders.

901
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:40,712
Serial killer, Jung Ba Reum, canceled his appeal,

902
01:09:41,382 --> 01:09:44,282
and that means his execution has been finalized.

903
01:10:04,643 --> 01:10:07,013
(6 months later)

904
01:10:07,172 --> 01:10:09,483
(The right kind of correction leads to a bright future.)

905
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:25,992
(3H28 1124)

906
01:10:36,002 --> 01:10:37,803
(Emergency convoy)

907
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:48,813
(Establish law and order)

908
01:10:48,813 --> 01:10:49,853
He's here?

909
01:10:50,922 --> 01:10:52,053
Yes, that's him.

910
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:06,172
There you go. He finally has that look in his eyes again.

911
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:20,313
Your food's here.

912
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:31,023
You're the only guy I failed to kill.

913
01:11:32,393 --> 01:11:34,563
You remember how your friend, Kim Byung Tae, died, right?

914
01:11:35,532 --> 01:11:37,263
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

915
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:39,733
You just wait.

916
01:11:45,755 --> 01:11:47,726
Guard! Guard!

917
01:11:47,726 --> 01:11:49,325
(As long as you have a dream, you can always start over again.)

918
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:51,425
(Walk in one line.)

919
01:11:51,425 --> 01:11:54,096
(Do not talk while walking.)

920
01:11:54,096 --> 01:11:55,535
(Walk in one line.)

921
01:11:58,136 --> 01:11:59,606
Did you threaten Kim Soo Chul?

922
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:01,875
Did you threaten to kill him?

923
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,806
That darn rat.

924
01:12:04,846 --> 01:12:06,915
He already told you that?

925
01:12:09,886 --> 01:12:11,045
You're a monster.

926
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:13,085
How...

927
01:12:13,255 --> 01:12:14,615
Why did you volunteer to work here?

928
01:12:15,356 --> 01:12:16,356
Don't tell me...

929
01:12:17,955 --> 01:12:20,625
you missed me. Is that why?

930
01:12:22,526 --> 01:12:23,696
Did you miss me?

931
01:12:24,795 --> 01:12:25,865
Yes.

932
01:12:26,936 --> 01:12:29,606
I volunteered because I wanted to ask you something.

933
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:32,005
How could you do that?

934
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,575
How could you do that to Chi Kook?

935
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:38,245
How could you kill Bong Yi's grandmother and Father Ko?

936
01:12:38,776 --> 01:12:41,375
How could you do that to them? How?

937
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:44,846
What's so wrong about a lion killing a few rats?

938
01:12:46,085 --> 01:12:47,186
What?

939
01:12:47,186 --> 01:12:49,486
Don't you want to know why I didn't kill you?

940
01:12:50,886 --> 01:12:54,656
Because you weren't even worth it, you punk.

941
01:13:08,736 --> 01:13:09,806
You jerk.

942
01:13:18,545 --> 01:13:19,686
Hey...

943
01:13:20,585 --> 01:13:22,726
Emergency in cell 7. Emergency in cell 7.

944
01:13:22,825 --> 01:13:24,386
- Run. - Emergency in cell 7.

945
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,425
Let's go.

946
01:13:32,835 --> 01:13:34,035
What are you doing?

947
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:39,476
Are you okay?

948
01:13:51,346 --> 01:13:52,816
What a nice weather.

949
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:56,825
It's a pity I can't go outside to see some flowers.

950
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:11,665
I missed you, Dad.

951
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:28,283
Yes.

952
01:14:29,023 --> 01:14:31,353
I recognized you as soon as I saw the look in your eyes.

953
01:14:33,924 --> 01:14:36,924
That you were just as superior as me.

954
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:39,094
Do you have...

955
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:41,933
anything else you want to say...

956
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:44,103
to me?

957
01:14:44,874 --> 01:14:47,273
When I found out you were my son,

958
01:14:48,004 --> 01:14:49,304
I was extremely happy.

959
01:14:50,103 --> 01:14:51,874
I was proud of you.

960
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:57,344
Don't forget that we have superior genes than normal humans.

961
01:14:58,153 --> 01:14:59,954
Don't ever change again.

962
01:15:00,853 --> 01:15:01,954
Keep that look in your eyes.

963
01:15:28,243 --> 01:15:29,544
Don't worry.

964
01:15:31,254 --> 01:15:33,313
We'll be able to get out of here.

965
01:15:35,983 --> 01:15:37,084
Do you think...

966
01:15:40,124 --> 01:15:41,323
that's for the best?

967
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:43,424
Of course.

968
01:15:44,393 --> 01:15:47,794
I have everything planned.

969
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:26,334
Dong Koo, listen to me.

970
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:28,573
Dong Koo!

971
01:16:30,443 --> 01:16:33,344
When the time comes, open Han Seo Joon's cell for me.

972
01:16:33,874 --> 01:16:34,943
I...

973
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:38,783
I need to finish it.

974
01:17:19,294 --> 01:17:22,493
Breaking news. The Head Hunter, Han Seo Joon, was decapitated.

975
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,784
I should do what you did...

976
01:17:24,943 --> 01:17:27,513
and kill you in front of your kid.

977
01:17:28,383 --> 01:17:30,853
Han Seo Joon, I'll kill you...

978
01:17:31,254 --> 01:17:32,784
using the worst way possible.

979
01:17:32,883 --> 01:17:34,324
Keep your promise.

980
01:17:34,924 --> 01:17:36,454
Keep your promise to Moo Chi.

981
01:17:41,364 --> 01:17:42,834
(Prison guard saw it himself. Han Seo Joon, was decapitated.)

982
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:21,603
What's wrong?

983
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:26,273
Please... Please kill me.

984
01:18:26,674 --> 01:18:28,343
Please kill me already.

985
01:18:58,843 --> 01:19:00,303
I went to visit Hyun Soo.

986
01:19:06,813 --> 01:19:10,614
She says Ba Reum is dying soon.

987
01:19:11,853 --> 01:19:12,883
What?

988
01:19:12,983 --> 01:19:14,654
It's the after effect of the brain transplant.

989
01:19:15,294 --> 01:19:18,364
The prison guard says he can't bear to even look at him.

990
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:21,063
The pain must be excruciating.

991
01:19:21,893 --> 01:19:25,303
He said it felt like a mouse was gnawing at his brain.

992
01:19:27,464 --> 01:19:29,233
That's too easy for him.

993
01:19:29,674 --> 01:19:31,843
He needs to suffer much more pain. Much more.

994
01:19:36,643 --> 01:19:39,343
You have something to say to him as well.

995
01:19:40,883 --> 01:19:42,853
- Go see him before he dies... - No!

996
01:19:43,383 --> 01:19:44,754
Why should I see that dirtbag?

997
01:19:52,893 --> 01:19:55,364
- Sit. Sit down. - Ma'am.

998
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:59,034
Why did you drink so much?

999
01:19:59,603 --> 01:20:02,004
Stop drinking. You'll kill yourself at this rate.

1000
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,074
Ma'am.

1001
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,214
I need to ask you something.

1002
01:20:10,214 --> 01:20:11,683
You said you forgave...

1003
01:20:12,483 --> 01:20:14,143
that psychopathic father and son.

1004
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:16,983
How did you forgive them? Did you lose your mind?

1005
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:20,353
I'm not trying to forgive them...

1006
01:20:21,324 --> 01:20:23,193
for their sake.

1007
01:20:24,693 --> 01:20:26,324
It's for me. I want to live.

1008
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,794
I feel like I'll die otherwise.

1009
01:20:32,864 --> 01:20:35,603
When I heard what Father Ko said,

1010
01:20:36,904 --> 01:20:38,773
I felt his pain and fatigue...

1011
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:42,273
from all those years.

1012
01:20:44,414 --> 01:20:48,154
And I felt my pain and fatigue too.

1013
01:20:53,824 --> 01:20:55,924
That's when I let it all go.

1014
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,164
I told myself to forgive.

1015
01:20:59,494 --> 01:21:01,994
That my kids would want me to live.

1016
01:21:02,893 --> 01:21:05,504
That I'll show them I'm doing well.

1017
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:10,204
And then, I slept for days...

1018
01:21:10,273 --> 01:21:11,473
and days.

1019
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:14,148
When I woke up,

1020
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,257
I wanted to live.

1021
01:21:19,728 --> 01:21:23,558
Then... I was able to see...

1022
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:26,627
Soo Jung and Soo Ho.

1023
01:21:29,368 --> 01:21:30,667
Don't give me that garbage.

1024
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:33,938
I can't forgive him.

1025
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:38,348
Of course. I understand.

1026
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:40,778
Those of us who are left behind...

1027
01:21:41,448 --> 01:21:44,448
must find our own ways to live.

1028
01:21:47,717 --> 01:21:49,217
What matters is...

1029
01:21:51,118 --> 01:21:54,728
that we must live.

1030
01:21:57,297 --> 01:22:00,598
I wish you'd be free from your pain...

1031
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,438
at least a little bit...

1032
01:22:04,268 --> 01:22:06,507
and find your life.

1033
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,778
That's what your bother wanted too.

1034
01:23:07,268 --> 01:23:08,467
You're a lucky guy.

1035
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:12,507
I hear you're dying on your own. Darn it.

1036
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:16,037
I need to chop off your head and kill you.

1037
01:23:19,007 --> 01:23:20,148
I came to watch.

1038
01:23:21,108 --> 01:23:22,917
I wanted to see how pathetic you looked.

1039
01:23:26,188 --> 01:23:27,747
Do you think I'll forgive you because you chopped off...

1040
01:23:27,747 --> 01:23:28,917
your dad's head?

1041
01:23:29,558 --> 01:23:31,188
Dream on.

1042
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:41,127
I'm sorry.

1043
01:23:43,467 --> 01:23:44,868
And I was always...

1044
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:50,177
thankful.

1045
01:23:53,677 --> 01:23:55,547
In order to have the ability to kill someone,

1046
01:23:55,818 --> 01:23:57,848
you should have emptiness in your eyes.

1047
01:23:59,348 --> 01:24:02,488
But your eyes are filled with emotions.

1048
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:06,887
Anger, pain, regrets, sympathy,

1049
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:09,698
and love.

1050
01:24:09,997 --> 01:24:13,627
Now I understand what he meant by eyes being filled with emotions.

1051
01:24:14,997 --> 01:24:18,608
Your child is in pain and agony too.

1052
01:24:20,137 --> 01:24:22,037
I know I have no right, but I have a favor to ask.

1053
01:24:24,837 --> 01:24:26,608
Please use my assets...

1054
01:24:28,047 --> 01:24:30,247
to help the victims' families.

1055
01:24:32,648 --> 01:24:35,518
Do you think that will wash away an ounce of your sins?

1056
01:24:37,417 --> 01:24:38,927
And finally...

1057
01:24:41,358 --> 01:24:42,497
Bong Yi...

1058
01:24:49,997 --> 01:24:51,938
I miss Bong Yi.

1059
01:24:56,337 --> 01:24:57,877
You shameless jerk.

1060
01:24:58,348 --> 01:24:59,648
Would you come if you were her?

1061
01:25:09,488 --> 01:25:10,488
Let's go.

1062
01:25:16,058 --> 01:25:17,158
I hear you're dying.

1063
01:25:20,068 --> 01:25:23,337
I came to watch because I heard you were dying.

1064
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:29,278
It would be so unfair...

1065
01:25:30,337 --> 01:25:31,808
if you die that comfortably.

1066
01:25:33,707 --> 01:25:35,318
Scum like you should die...

1067
01:25:37,278 --> 01:25:39,518
with sticks stuck in your stomach,

1068
01:25:41,688 --> 01:25:43,558
burned alive,

1069
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:46,787
with your lungs removed,

1070
01:25:48,257 --> 01:25:50,257
with your stomach filled with stones...

1071
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:51,728
That's how...

1072
01:25:58,768 --> 01:25:59,938
What did you want to say?

1073
01:26:01,438 --> 01:26:03,677
Why did you call me all the way here?

1074
01:26:06,648 --> 01:26:08,108
I wanted to say...

1075
01:26:12,348 --> 01:26:13,648
I'm sorry.

1076
01:26:21,127 --> 01:26:22,198
I...

1077
01:26:23,598 --> 01:26:24,997
will never forgive you...

1078
01:26:25,827 --> 01:26:27,297
for as long as I live.

1079
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:31,037
I'll curse you for the rest of my life.

1080
01:26:33,268 --> 01:26:34,608
That's what I came to say.

1081
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:38,037
In my next life...

1082
01:26:42,818 --> 01:26:44,917
I'll be born as an ordinary human being.

1083
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:52,087
Then...

1084
01:26:58,127 --> 01:26:59,127
If I do...

1085
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:12,507
(Visiting Room)

1086
01:28:35,913 --> 01:28:36,944
They say...

1087
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:39,583
I was born a monster.

1088
01:28:41,413 --> 01:28:42,553
Please don't let me...

1089
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:45,894
become a monster.

1090
01:28:47,524 --> 01:28:48,623
Please.

1091
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:11,713
The Almighty...

1092
01:29:13,454 --> 01:29:15,324
heard your prayers.

1093
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,034
You're no longer...

1094
01:29:33,473 --> 01:29:34,574
a monster.

1095
01:30:16,614 --> 01:30:18,814
(3 years later)

1096
01:30:18,814 --> 01:30:20,583
- A pardon? - No way!

1097
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:23,184
Breaking news. President Shin Sung Min...

1098
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:26,293
granted former secretary Choi Young Shin a pardon...

1099
01:30:26,293 --> 01:30:27,623
despite the protest from the people.

1100
01:30:27,793 --> 01:30:29,994
The Blue House stressed how this pardon...

1101
01:30:29,994 --> 01:30:32,064
could lead to a great union of our society.

1102
01:30:32,133 --> 01:30:33,763
- A pardon? - No way!

1103
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:35,434
- A pardon? - No way.

1104
01:30:35,434 --> 01:30:37,163
- A pardon? - No way!

1105
01:30:37,163 --> 01:30:38,774
- A pardon? - No way.

1106
01:30:38,774 --> 01:30:40,503
- A pardon? - No way!

1107
01:30:40,503 --> 01:30:42,034
- A pardon? - No way.

1108
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:43,704
- A pardon? - No way!

1109
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,373
- A pardon? - No way.

1110
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:47,043
- A pardon? - No way!

1111
01:30:47,043 --> 01:30:48,744
- A pardon? - No way.

1112
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:49,784
Mom!

1113
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:53,154
Eun Chong, come over here.

1114
01:31:01,894 --> 01:31:03,623
- Have you been well? - Yes.

1115
01:31:10,864 --> 01:31:12,833
The pardoning of Choi Young Shin...

1116
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,133
stirred up wrath among the people...

1117
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:16,543
which has led to a significant drop in the president's approval rating.

1118
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:44,704
Get your eggs.

1119
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,034
Your eggs!

1120
01:31:46,574 --> 01:31:48,604
Oh Bong Yi, eggs!

1121
01:31:48,673 --> 01:31:50,604
Get up. You'll be late for class.

1122
01:31:50,704 --> 01:31:52,314
The sun is high up in the sky!

1123
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:54,713
- Darn him. - Get up and get to class!

1124
01:31:55,173 --> 01:31:57,383
- Please enjoy. Thank you. - Thank you.

1125
01:31:57,383 --> 01:32:00,614
- You're causing a commotion. - Don't you know what time it is?

1126
01:32:00,614 --> 01:32:02,154
Do you know how many eggs I need to sell...

1127
01:32:02,154 --> 01:32:03,324
to put you through college?

1128
01:32:03,324 --> 01:32:05,024
I'm going to pay you back, you know.

1129
01:32:05,024 --> 01:32:07,354
Besides, I said I didn't want to go to college.

1130
01:32:07,494 --> 01:32:10,723
Working the show and taking classes. I'm not Superwoman, you know.

1131
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:19,104
Mister, you know,

1132
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,173
I've been offered a job as the main writer for a new show.

1133
01:32:23,543 --> 01:32:24,604
You wait and see.

1134
01:32:25,074 --> 01:32:26,574
Once I get that job,

1135
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:29,713
I'll build the fairest and most just world ever...

1136
01:32:29,713 --> 01:32:31,684
- so that no one feels wronged... - Hold on a second.

1137
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:34,354
Your tuition money plus interest.

1138
01:32:34,354 --> 01:32:36,654
That new job comes with a salary raise, right?

1139
01:32:36,654 --> 01:32:37,883
When did you become a loan shark?

1140
01:32:38,524 --> 01:32:39,854
Unbelievable.

1141
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:40,954
(Fresh Eggs)

1142
01:32:43,494 --> 01:32:45,793
- What's this? - Don't.

1143
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:48,394
That's for me.

1144
01:32:48,593 --> 01:32:51,003
You hate beans as much as you hate carrots.

1145
01:32:53,074 --> 01:32:55,104
She'll be out by now, right?

1146
01:32:55,744 --> 01:32:56,803
Who?

1147
01:32:57,043 --> 01:32:58,543
Do you take me for an idiot?

1148
01:32:59,114 --> 01:33:00,213
Go to her.

1149
01:33:00,513 --> 01:33:02,583
Say you're sorry...

1150
01:33:02,684 --> 01:33:05,713
- and in person... - Get your eggs.

1151
01:33:06,184 --> 01:33:08,553
- Be a man and... - Big in size.

1152
01:33:08,614 --> 01:33:11,053
Get your fresh eggs.

1153
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:14,154
They use recordings for that these days.

1154
01:33:14,154 --> 01:33:16,064
Only a geezer would use a megaphone.

1155
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:20,394
Hey, kid. Don't you know that retro is trending?

1156
01:33:21,133 --> 01:33:22,934
Drop me off at the market.

1157
01:33:23,303 --> 01:33:25,904
- Why? - I invited Ms. Choi's family...

1158
01:33:25,904 --> 01:33:27,173
over for dinner.

1159
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:29,003
Dong Koo will be there too.

1160
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:31,074
You can come if you want.

1161
01:33:31,574 --> 01:33:32,713
How can I go there...

1162
01:33:33,343 --> 01:33:34,444
after what I have done?

1163
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:39,253
Japchae and pork, check.

1164
01:33:40,984 --> 01:33:42,053
What else...

1165
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:53,994
I almost forgot.

1166
01:33:54,093 --> 01:33:56,434
I should get some fried chicken for the kids.

1167
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,463
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1168
01:34:36,473 --> 01:34:37,944
It's not your fault.

1169
01:34:39,213 --> 01:34:40,774
It was me who didn't trust him.

1170
01:34:41,944 --> 01:34:43,013
It's on me.

1171
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:47,114
We both wronged him in a way we shouldn't be forgiven.

1172
01:34:48,284 --> 01:34:49,324
Right.

1173
01:34:50,553 --> 01:34:52,354
I'll atone for that until the day I die.

1174
01:34:53,394 --> 01:34:54,454
Same here.

1175
01:34:58,163 --> 01:35:00,364
I want you to be happy.

1176
01:35:03,803 --> 01:35:04,904
You too.

1177
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:11,173
I'll try to be for Eun Chong's sake.

1178
01:35:18,614 --> 01:35:19,654
See you around then.

1179
01:35:29,593 --> 01:35:30,793
Jae Hee!

1180
01:35:31,394 --> 01:35:32,434
Hey, Eun Chong.

1181
01:35:32,633 --> 01:35:34,293
What are you guys doing here?

1182
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:37,833
It's a bird.

1183
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:40,503
It came flying from over there.

1184
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:41,973
Did it?

1185
01:35:43,144 --> 01:35:44,574
How adorable.

1186
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:49,614
How about I name the bird?

1187
01:35:49,614 --> 01:35:50,684
Sure!

1188
01:35:52,013 --> 01:35:54,053
How about "Eobeong"?

1189
01:35:54,114 --> 01:35:55,314
I like Eobeong.

1190
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,524
- It's cute. - Is it?

1191
01:35:57,984 --> 01:35:59,293
Hi, Eobeong.

1192
01:35:59,994 --> 01:36:01,253
Eobeong.

1193
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:04,723
I like Eobeong. It's cute.

1194
01:36:12,973 --> 01:36:14,633
Get your eggs.

1195
01:36:15,034 --> 01:36:18,104
Large eggs straight from the farm.

1196
01:36:19,343 --> 01:36:22,314
Get your eggs. Your eggs!

1197
01:36:23,513 --> 01:36:26,053
There was a monster who couldn't be saved.

1198
01:36:27,553 --> 01:36:30,223
But the Almighty granted him emotions.

1199
01:36:31,154 --> 01:36:34,854
The Almighty heard your prayers.

1200
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:37,223
You're no longer...

1201
01:36:40,534 --> 01:36:41,734
a monster.

1202
01:37:18,507 --> 01:37:19,776
And in the end,

1203
01:37:22,116 --> 01:37:25,616
he died in extreme pain and misery as he repented for his sins.

1204
01:37:28,286 --> 01:37:30,456
(RIP Jung Ba Reum)

1205
01:37:34,026 --> 01:37:35,156
Did the deity...

1206
01:37:36,427 --> 01:37:38,397
do that to punish him...

1207
01:37:39,536 --> 01:37:43,036
or to save him?

1208
01:38:12,297 --> 01:38:19,406
