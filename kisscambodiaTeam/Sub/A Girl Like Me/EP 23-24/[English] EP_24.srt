<i>Episode 24</i>

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,710
You’re awake, Miss.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,000
Who are you?

38
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,630
Where am I?

39
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,710
Calm down, Miss.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,280
Call me Mrs. Wang. This is my place.

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,120
Have a seat.

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,910
Sit with me.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,120
Wang Daqiang, bring me some hot water.

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,590
You’ve slept for three days and nights.

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,630
That long?

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
Three days ago, someone brought you here

47
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,840
and paid me to look after you.

48
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,710
Who was that?

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,590
He didn’t say,

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
so I have no idea.

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,190
Is he a handsome

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
and scholarly gentleman?

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,560
I don’t know about scholarly

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,870
but he’s indeed good-looking.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,750
That must be Count Cheng’an.

56
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,000
He couldn’t see me drift to Xizhou.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,030
Here’s water.

58
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,800
Miss,

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
wash your hands.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,630
I’ll let you know
when the meal is ready.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,120
Thanks for looking after me.

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,710
Don’t mention it.

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,840
Take it.

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,830
Minister, help, Minister!

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,430
Minister, help, Minister!

66
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,920
Minister, help, Minister!

67
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,390
Minister, help, Minister!

68
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,680
Minister, Minister!

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,390
I’ve been

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,390
in this uniform for 40 years.

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,310
But I never thought

72
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,310
I would

73
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,950
take it off today.

74
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,920
His Grace

75
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,950
is not coming for the uniform.

76
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,190
Mr. Shi.

77
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,240
His Majesty

78
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,040
granted you a cup of wine.

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,430
It seems His Majesty

80
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,600
would never spare me.

81
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,240
Mr. Shi,

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
please don’t let His Majesty down.

83
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,430
Count Cheng’an,

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,750
I’m now a dying man.

85
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,120
I only have one question.

86
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Why did you corner me?

87
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,560
Shi Chonghai, you don’t deserve
to be the minister.

88
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
You’ve killed

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,720
too many people for your influence.

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,430
Shunzi’s family is not
the only innocent one.

91
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,070
Tell me.

92
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,870
Why did you kill Mr. Rong?

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,720
He knew too many things.

94
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,870
You are blaming him after killing him.

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,270
How can you be so unashamed?

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,950
What did Mr. Rong know?

97
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,750
The guilty deeds you’ve done

98
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,240
for Crown Princess

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,870
or the lives

100
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,720
threatened by you?

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,070
It seems Prime Minister Yan

102
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
has given me away.

103
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,270
I did have the selfish idea!

104
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,120
May I ask you one thing?

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,190
You’ve investigated

106
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,120
into the Rong’s case. Any idea?

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,390
Why was it uneventful in the court when

108
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,600
two important officials were killed?

109
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,310
Young Master, don’t listen to him!

110
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,040
He’s shifting the blame.

111
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,830
No matter what I guess,

112
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,510
it can’t be better than the cruel you

113
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,000
telling the truth!

114
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,720
Your Grace! You are thinking much of me.

115
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
In that case,

116
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,360
I was just consumed by others.

117
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,120
I did a thing right for that moment.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,670
Well!

119
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,630
I

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
am going to die now.

121
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,670
Since Your Grace

122
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,150
want to know the truth,

123
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,630
I will tell you everything.

124
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,790
It’s because

125
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,120
Old General Ban lost the Tiger Tally.

126
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,390
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

127
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,030
he tried to get Tiger Tally but failed.

128
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,840
His Majesty was upset about it.

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,750
So Yan Hui gave an advice,

130
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,080
asking the Old General Ban

131
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,150
for Tiger Tally with your father’s help.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,750
We can’t find it even with Rong’s help.

133
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,870
It seems the Tiger Tally is really lost.

134
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,270
Your Majesty!

135
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
I don’t think

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. Rong’s words

137
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
are believable.

138
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,510
I believe Rong wouldn’t lie to me.

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Your Majesty!

140
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,440
Mr. Rong is on good terms with Mr. Ban.

141
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,120
I’m afraid

142
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Mr. Rong will lose his head
for the moment

143
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,030
and cheats you with the Bans.

144
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,910
It’s not possible!

145
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,000
Your Majesty! Tiger Tally matters a lot.

146
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,080
Any carelessness

147
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,320
may endanger your power.

148
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,910
If you keep being softhearted…

149
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,270
Mr. Yan, no more talk.

150
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,390
Mr. Yan.

151
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,910
What are you doing?

152
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,720
This is the only way

153
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,840
to break through the two families

154
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
and to get the Tiger Tally.

155
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,000
Mr. Yan.

156
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
Mr. Ban and Mr. Rong
are important officials of Daye.

157
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
You can’t do that!

158
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,150
Mr. Xie.

159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,790
You want to be my enemy?

160
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
I… Uh!

161
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,030
Mr. Yan.

162
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,120
Why did you ask Mr. Xie

163
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,320
and me to come

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,390
in such a hurry?

165
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,550
Mr. Shi.

166
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,000
The wine is from the Western Regions.

167
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,720
At the behest of His Majesty,

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,150
please take it to Rong’s Mansion.

169
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,000
Your Majesty!

170
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,440
Your Majesty!

171
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,030
Mr. Rong died.

172
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,390
What? Why?

173
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,000
Your Majesty! I did that.

174
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,790
Yan Hui! How dare you

175
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,200
kill Rong without my knowledge?

176
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,480
Your Majesty!

177
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
I did that to find out the Tiger Tally.

178
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,200
You killed Rong.

179
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,840
Then where is the Tiger Tally?

180
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,120
My men have searched the whole mansion,

181
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,750
but we didn’t find it.

182
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
In my opinion,

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,910
the Tiger Tally is still in

184
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,240
Princess Royal’s hands

185
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
since it’s not in Rong’s Mansion.

186
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,720
What are you going to do?

187
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,630
Aunt is like my mother.

188
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,750
If you dare to act wildly,

189
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
I won’t spare you.

190
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,870
Your Majesty. It’s my own idea

191
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,790
but has nothing to do with you.

192
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,240
I’d like to bear

193
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,150
all blame of others for Your Majesty!

194
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,390
Please agree!

195
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,030
Your Highness, hold on!

196
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,150
It’s poisonous! You can’t eat it.

197
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,120
His Majesty wants to kill me!

198
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,360
It’s Yan Hui’s plot.

199
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,670
He did that for the Tiger Tally.

200
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,840
Bastard!

201
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,550
How dare he confuse His Majesty!

202
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,120
I will see His Majesty!

203
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,630
I will teach this evil guy a lesson.

204
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Your Highness, please hold on.

205
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
Yan Hui is insidious.

206
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
He already killed Mr. Rong.

207
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,390
If you go now hastily,

208
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,080
I’m afraid it’ll be bad for you!

209
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,910
You mean Mr. Rong didn’t die of illness?

210
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,030
Say it!

211
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,630
Yes.

212
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,080
Mr. Rong was poisoned to death

213
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,790
after drinking the wine

214
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,000
from the Western Regions.

215
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,390
My husband was poisoned by accident.

216
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,510
Now Mr. Rong…

217
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,510
Two important officials

218
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,240
were sacrificed for the Tiger Tally.

219
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Yes.

220
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,670
It seems His Majesty won’t let go

221
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,390
if he can’t get the Tiger Tally.

222
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,390
If you have the Tiger Tally,

223
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
you’d give it out to save your life.

224
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,910
Do you mean I deceived His Majesty?

225
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,000
No. No. No.

226
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,550
If I know where the Tiger Tally is,

227
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,000
how could I let my husband

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,750
and Mr. Rong suffer all that?

229
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,320
I will see His Majesty.

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,910
Your Highness!

231
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,240
Please save Mrs. Rong
and Younger Master.

232
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,870
Say it!

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,360
Make it clear!

234
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,840
What’s wrong with them?

235
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,200
They are fine now.

236
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,390
But Elder Master…

237
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,030
He died!

238
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,840
Your Highness.

239
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,440
Your Highness.

240
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,150
Her Highness and I discussed about it

241
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,240
and arranged you to enter the Palace

242
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,030
as Crown Prince’s study partner,

243
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,320
so that you can become friends

244
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,030
to protect you,

245
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,030
the last one of your family.

246
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,270
I didn’t kill them.

247
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,600
But they died because of me.

248
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Shi Chonghai.

249
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,270
Do you think your crimes

250
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,550
can be covered up by hiding them?

251
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,870
I’ve traced the truth for years.

252
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,630
How couldn’t I know you were in Imperial

253
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,790
Study while Yan Hui was giving
the advice.

254
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,120
The one outside was Count Xie.

255
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,390
You pretended to save Princess Royal

256
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,440
for the whereabouts of the Tiger Tally.

257
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,150
His Majesty and Mr. Rong were friends.

258
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,870
I didn’t expect Yan Hui

259
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,240
to be so bold.

260
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,240
It’s not that you didn’t expect.

261
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,080
You were just greedy!

262
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,960
Yan Hui promised to help your

263
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,720
granddaughter be the Crown Princess.

264
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,750
Yan Hui really betrayed me.

265
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,270
Mr. Rong.

266
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
General Ban.

267
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,840
I’m sorry.

268
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,960
Please wait.

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
I…

270
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,080
I’m coming to meet you now.

271
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,880
Shi Chonghai.

272
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,350
You are not qualified to meet them.

273
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,510
Young Master will never do things like

274
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
giving others the poisonous wine.

275
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,680
Count Cheng’an.

276
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,440
You always have good plans.

277
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,350
But you can never win His Majesty!

278
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,920
Have you ever thought

279
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
about the reason

280
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,070
why nobody

281
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,830
dare to talk about the old story,

282
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,270
why His Majesty still use
Yan Hui and me?

283
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,750
If the Tiger Tally can’t be found out,

284
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
the tragedy will continue.

285
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,790
Shi Chonghai.

286
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,550
How could you let the Shi family

287
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,920
become like this?

379
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,200
His Grace to be with Her Grace alone.

380
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,070
I heard Count Cheng’an was so drunk.

381
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,830
I’m afraid even Du Jiu couldn’t stop it.

382
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,720
What makes you so happy?

383
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,110
Can you tell it to us?

384
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,960
Your Grace, My Lady. Nothing.

385
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,310
The gossip about Count Cheng’an and me?

386
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

387
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,200
You silly girl! Why did you admit it?

388
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,750
You don’t need to gossip.

389
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,920
His Grace was drunk

390
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,720
so he came for me to talk.

391
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,400
They are going to marry soon.

392
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,920
Is that so strange?

393
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes. Yes.

394
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,750
We are worrying

395
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,550
that others may gossip

396
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,510
about it

397
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,880
and it will make you unhappy.

398
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,750
Yes. Yes.

399
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,070
Enough. Go get some tea.

400
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
His Grace can have it after he wakes up.

401
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,440
OK. I will do it right now.

402
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,270
Anyway,

403
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,350
I feel there’s something

404
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,030
that His Grace can’t let it go.

405
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,880
Otherwise, he wouldn’t drink that much.

406
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,750
You should

407
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,790
comfort him when you are free.

408
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,270
Got it.

409
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,590
I’ve taken you in for days.

410
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,030
It’s time for you to pay me back.

411
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,350
What do you want?

412
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,920
Don’t scream!

413
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,310
Wanna run away?

414
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,550
Get up!

415
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,960
Let go of me.

416
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,350
Let me go!

417
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,350
You!

418
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
You bitch!

419
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,590
-Mrs. Wang!
-How dare you seduce my husband?

420
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,550
All women from the city are bad.

421
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,720
I take you in

422
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,200
but you seduce my husband.

423
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,960
Wang Daqiang.

424
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,880
It’s just a few days.

425
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,030
How could you do such a thing?

426
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,960
She seduced me first.

427
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,110
Are you crazy?

428
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,240
That’s our tool for money.

429
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,510
Darling, listen to me.

430
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,590
Bullshit!

431
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,110
The woman seduced me first!

432
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,000
Shucks!

433
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,510
The woman seduced me first!

434
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,640
Darling! What’s that smell?

435
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,480
Is it on fire?

436
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,830
It’s smoking.

437
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,680
-Open the door!
-Anybody out there?

438
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,440
Please open the door!

439
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,250
-Help!
-Open the door!

440
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,750
-Anybody there?
-Anybody there? Open the door.

441
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,240
Help!

442
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,110
Open the door!

443
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,400
Help!

444
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,070
Open the door. Anybody there?

445
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,510
Help!

446
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,070
Feixian.

447
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,110
I’m here to save you.

448
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,920
Why didn’t you wait for me?

449
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,270
Why?

450
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,920
Your Grace. Young Master

451
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,310
pretends not to concern about it,

452
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,440
but he still can’t let it go.

453
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,000
It can’t go like this.

454
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,680
Your Grace, please find a way.

455
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,030
Your Grace.

456
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,000
Hua.

457
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,480
Mr. Du

458
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,880
just told me that you went for

459
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,720
Shi Chonghai that day.

460
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,720
Du Jiu

461
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,510
shouldn’t have told you that.

462
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,590
I can understand.

463
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,680
You don’t want me to get involved.

464
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,200
But it’s a great event.

465
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,480
You shouldn’t have suffered that alone.

466
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,790
We are family now.

467
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,310
Shouldn’t you discuss with me?

468
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,350
Discuss?

469
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,270
So you will also go for His Majesty?

470
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,590
Maybe

471
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,200
His Majesty had no other choice

472
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,070
for the situation at that time.

473
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Why did you speak for him?

474
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,640
It’s not just my family.

475
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,920
Old General Ban also died for that.

476
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,790
Princess Royal knew His Majesty well.

477
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,160
So she hid the Tiger Tally at pains

478
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,270
and gave it to me

479
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,830
till she was critically ill.

480
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
Do you think

481
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,350
Princess Royal was wrong?

482
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,510
I didn’t speak for His Majesty.

483
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,070
But we can’t trust Minister Shi.

484
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,440
What if

485
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,200
he misled you on purpose?

486
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,830
I’ve thought about all that.

487
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,200
But what Shi Chonghai said

488
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,270
is the same as your grandma’s words.

489
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,830
It’s just because I know everything.

490
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,880
I can’t do anything right now.

491
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,000
Because

492
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,070
I promised Princess Royal I’ll protect

493
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
you and your family.

494
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,480
My mother also wanted me to live well

495
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,510
without thinking about family hatred.

496
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,960
But once I think that

497
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
he looks so fatherly

498
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,310
but he might kill my family,

499
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,270
I just can’t bear it.

500
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,160
I don’t know what to do either.

501
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,680
Because you

502
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,640
still have your parents,

503
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,160
and your brother.

504
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,590
But I

505
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,550
am alone.

506
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,310
You are not alone.

507
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,640
You have me.

508
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,480
We’re together no matter what happens.

509
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,640
It’s lucky to meet you.

510
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,440
I hope you can cherish the fate

511
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,750
like me.

512
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,270
You are upset today.

513
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,920
I will come next time.

514
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,940

516
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,760

The first family in the capital

became like this.

519
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,550

00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,660

there is no place for me in the capital.

522
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,920
there is no place for me in the capital.

523
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:58,940
<i>Shi’s Mansion</i>

524
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,360
Practice harder.

525
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,230
You didn’t make a great progress.

526
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,590
Anyway, practice makes perfect.

527
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,960
Two more hours per day.

528
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,000
It’ll be eight hours.

529
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,710
Yes.

530
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,000
Except sleeping,

531
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,110
you have eight hours for other things.

532
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,960
Rocky.

533
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,760
Do we have ginseng and chicken?

534
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,880
The cook did buy some chicken today

535
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,960
for steamed chicken with scallion oil.

536
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,960
For ginseng,

537
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
we always have a lot.

538
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,440
Your Grace, do you want chicken soup?

539
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,800
It’s not me.

540
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,760
I want to make some for His Grace.

541
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,280
Hua, please don’t.

542
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,440
You’ve made a lot of strange food.

543
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,320
It’s OK for me.

544
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,760
But His Grace is weak.

545
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,150
He can’t stand that.

546
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I’ve said

547
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,590
practice makes perfect.

548
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,590
Yes.

549
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,960
I’m not good at cooking.

550
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,840
But I can practice more.

551
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,880
His Grace has grown up alone.

552
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,550
I’ll be his wife.

553
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,400
So I should learn more things

554
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,630
so that he can feel the warmth.

555
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,360
The cook can do that.

556
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,710
Why yourself?

557
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
To show my sincerity.

558
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,480
What about my steamed chicken?

559
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,710
Have it tomorrow.

560
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,800
Practice hard.

561
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,190
Watch him.

562
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,840
Come on. Practice.

563
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
Practice. Practice.

564
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,440

00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,400
Your Highness. What do you mean?

567
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,880
Did you set the fire?

568
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,800
Your Highness. I don’t understand.

569
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,920
I’m asking you again.

570
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,110
Did you burn Shi Feixian to death?

571
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,440
Shi Feixian was burned to death?

572
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,960
Really?

573
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
Don’t pretend.

574
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,030
For the sake of your sister,

575
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,190
you want Shi Feixian to die very much.

576
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,280
I don’t know

577
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
why you think so.

578
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,230
But I won’t do that silly thing

579
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,000
in this kind of situation

580
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,280
even if I am really stupid.

581
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,960
Then what else would it be?

582
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,070
If you insist

583
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,630
I killed Shi Feixian,

584
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,070
you can kill me.

585
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,110
But I have to remind you

586
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,360
nobody else

587
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,880
can help you get the throne.

588
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,510
If I don’t know it, you are dead now.

589
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,480
Prince Luo. Daye’s full of beauties.

590
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,110
Please look at the big picture.

591
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,510
What should I do now?

592
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,110
Count Cheng’an defeated Shi Chonghai.

593
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,480
It’s the weakest time for Crown Prince.

594
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,360
You should defeat Count Cheng’an now.

595
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,550
Then Crown Prince has nobody to use.

596
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,320
Defeating Count Cheng’an?

597
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,320
Who can do that?

598
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,000
His Majesty.

599
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,480
His Majesty?

600
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,980
<i>Rong’s Mansion</i>

601
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,030
Your Grace, what brings you here?

602
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,480
His Grace looks gaunt recently.

603
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,800
So I made ginseng chicken soup for him

604
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,760
to tonify Qi.

605
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,230
Young Master is in the study room.
Please come with me.

606
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,630
No, thanks.

607
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,710
Let him take a break peacefully.

608
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Your Grace, you’ve already been here.

609
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,030
Why don’t you get in?

610
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,400
Yes. Get in please.

611
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,030
If you are not in there,

612
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,880
I’m afraid he will let you down.

613
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,030
Your Grace,
maybe you can get in for him.

614
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,360
Your Grace, come on.

615
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,760
Try the chicken soup I made.

616
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
I did that for the first time.

617
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,070
I don’t know how it is.

618
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,360
Here you are.

619
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,440
Hua, last time…

620
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,230
You didn’t feel well.

621
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,510
I didn’t put it in mind.

622
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,400
You made the soup for me?

623
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,150
I will surely have a try.

624
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,510
Mr. Du, will you try some?

625
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,760
It should be only for His Grace.

626
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
How is it?

627
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,840
Hua,
you made the soup for the first time.

628
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,110
But it’s so tasty.

629
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,190
Really?

630
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,710
This is all for you.

631
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,510
Drink it all.

632
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,960
It’s about too much.

633
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,150
Let me help you.

634
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,710
No.

635
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,480
You made that for me.

636
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,030
I won’t let you down.

637
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,280
Have some meat too.

638
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,030
I can’t believe

639
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,960
I’m so talented in cooking.

640
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,030
Since it’s delicious,

641
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,280
I will make more for you tomorrow.

642
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,980
<i>Banished Immortal Yard</i>

643
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,000
Some wolfberries.

644
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,480
Hua, there must be a use for my talent.

645
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,400
Like the saying goes…

646
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,670
Dad, please stop.

647
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,440
Don’t beat around the bush!

648
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,670
Hua, don’t make chicken soup again.

649
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,510
It really tastes bad.

650
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,360
Yes.

651
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,030
It’s impossible.

652
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,110
His Grace had it all and praised me.

653
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
You can have it yourself.

654
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,510
So bitter?

655
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,150
Count Cheng’an didn’t say anything

656
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,760
and had it all.

657
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,840
He even didn’t let me help.

658
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,670
Don’t you understand that?

659
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,510
He loves you from his heart.

660
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,070
So he didn’t tell you the truth

661
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,920
but taking them all.

662
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,670
Is that so?

663
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
So it means our Count

664
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,400
loves me very much.

665
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,760
No.

666
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,150
I will practice my cooking skill.

667
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,030
Please don’t.

668
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,320
It’s really hard for Count Cheng’an.

669
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,400
Xie Wanyu is the one good at cooking.

670
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,510
How do you know that?

671
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,030
That’s not the point.

672
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,070
The point is my brother-in-law.

673
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,880
What was wrong with him?

674
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,440
No big deal.

675
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,960
We’ve talked about it.

676
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,630
He thought of something before

677
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,510
and missed his family.

678
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,320
So he got himself drunk.

679
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,000
Then he missed me and…

680
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,150
Why did he drink alone?

681
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,110
Tell him

682
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,710
I will drink with him in the future.

683
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,840
OK.

684
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,920
I will tell him next time.

685
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,030
You’re excited on talking about liquor.

686
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,280
Who is that?

687
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,880
Feixian…

688
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,880
Your Highness.

689
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,400
Feixian, it’s really you.

690
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,190
Did you get hurt?

691
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,760
I’m alright.

692
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,000
It’s too dark here.

693
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,670
I lost my nerve,

694
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,480
so I disturbed Your Highness.

695
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,030
Please don’t blame me.

696
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,190
It’s OK.

697
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,710
It’s really great

698
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,230
to meet you here.

699
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,760
I thought you’ve been burned to death.

700
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,510
Did you look for me?

701
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,480
Yes.

702
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,630
I saw the ruins and the charred body

703
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,000
when I arrived there.

704
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,920
By the way,

705
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,400
I got your hairpin.

706
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,920
It’s great.

707
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,070
Your Highness,
you care about me so much.

708
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,280
I don’t know how to thank you.

709
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,110
Feixian, I’m sorry

710
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,360
for making you upset by the unkindness.

711
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,000
How about

712
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,030
going back with me to the yard?

713
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

714
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,880
But I’m guilty.

715
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,320
I don’t want to bring you trouble.

716
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,590
Feixian.

717
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,880
It’s lucky for me

718
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
to meet you here.

719
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,000
I don’t want to lose you anymore.
