00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
Let go of me.

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,400
Let go.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,480
Let go.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,480
Bro!

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,120
I’m the noblest lady in Daye.

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,710
How could I be humiliated like this?

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,960
I can’t get what I love.
I won’t be happy this life.

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,190
If there is a next life,

44
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,080
I wish to be an ordinary girl

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,910
and no longer be fooled by the powers.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,800
I,

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Jiang Luo, a unfilial son,

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,710
got carried

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,750
away,

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,190
ordered my men to attack Duke Jingting

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,400
and framed Shi Feixian.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,240
Duke Jingting was suffered
physically and mentally

53
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
and Shi Feixian was exiled.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,750
I’m

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,840
snaky and deceitful.

56
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,190
I committed towering crimes

57
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,030
and made a fool of myself.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,560
I’m repentant now.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,150
Please punish me

60
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,190
in any way you want

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
and do not show mercy.

62
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,910
Jiang Luo.

63
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,560
Luo,

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,120
you wrote it?

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,080
That’s true.

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,710
Your Majesty, look.

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,520

<i>Jiang Luo</i>

70
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,080
Such a poor handwriting.

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,710
Seems you’re a little unconvinced?

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
Father, I dare not.

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,560
Your Majesty, Luo has been sickly

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,390
and spoiled by me.

75
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,870
After all, he’s our son.

76
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,310
Please trust him this time.

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,870
Fine.

78
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,560
I get older.

79
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,560
My biggest wish is

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,600
you could get along with your brother.

81
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,390
When I pass away,

82
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,360
you’d assist your brother
in governing Daye.

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,560
Since you promised,

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
just apologize to Ban Hua in good faith.

85
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,240
Wang De,

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,430
arrange a royal banquet tomorrow

87
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,040
and invite the Bans.

88
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

89
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,630
Still stand there? Take yourself off.

90
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,480
Father, I have a request.

91
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,800
What is it?

92
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,560
Father,

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,720
may Shi Feixian come back?

94
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,800
Stop.

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,240
You bastard!

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,950
Father, as long as Feixian comes back,

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,310
I will never be disobedient to you.

98
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,120
Even if

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
let me assist my brother.

100
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,830
You, get out!

101
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,120
Get out of here.

102
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,630
Father.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,310
Get out.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
The physician said

105
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,750
the girl is not in danger of life.

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,310
She’s just in lethargy.

107
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I’ll pay you every month.

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,870
Hope you could

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,070
look after the girl.

110
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,680
Thank you.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,750
Don’t worry.

112
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,560
I’ll take good care of her.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Thanks.

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,120
Your Highness.

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,000
The robbers have been captured,

116
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,430
but one of them ran away.

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,510
Find him immediately.

118
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,920
Before that,

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,510
arrange two guards here

120
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,190
to protect Miss Shi.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Yes.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
Luo,

123
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,070
take my advice.

124
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,720
Everything will be fine
as long as you keep a low profile today.

125
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,040
Mother, how could everything be fine

126
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,360
if Ban Hua is in the capital?

127
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,920
I swear

128
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,160
I’ll expel her from the capital.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
There is no time

130
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,920
to be slow-witted!

131
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,040
Your father is always unhappy with you.

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,190
This is especially true today.

133
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,950
If you contradict him again,

134
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,510
it’s you

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,120
not Ban Hua

136
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,830
who will be expelled.

137
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,950
Mother,

138
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,430
am I really

139
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,680
the biological child of father?

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,750
How ridiculous!

141
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,870
Your Highness.

142
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Duke Jingting, please.

143
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,720
Princess Ban, please step inside.

144
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,430
Thank you.

145
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,630
It’s so weird.

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,040
Nobody greets me?

147
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Hurry up.

148
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,190
Young Master Ban, please step inside.

149
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,310
Thank you.

150
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,600
Luo, be patient.

151
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,160
You must bear with everything today.

152
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,030
It tastes delicious.

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,550
I’ll bring Shunzi a drumstick.

154
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,550
Heng, don’t be rude.

155
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
Never mind.

156
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,840
It’s a family feast.
No need to be punctilious.

157
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,750
Luo,

158
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,550
why not propose a toast to your uncle?

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Uncle, please take the wine!

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,480
I’ll do it myself.

161
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,630
Thank you!

162
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,840
You’re a senior.

163
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,510
Just take it.

164
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,600
My fault for what happened days ago.

165
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,360
Please forgive me.

166
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,630
Cousin Luo, what you said is ambiguous.

167
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,270
What happened days ago?

168
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
Forgive you for what?

169
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,000
None of your business. Shut up.

170
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,270
His Majesty said,
no need to be punctilious.

171
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,960
I wanted to figure it out.

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,750
Is there a problem?

173
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,910
Am I right, Your Majesty?

174
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,000
You two grow up

175
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,510
together since childhood,

176
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,480
but never stop quarreling.

177
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,670
Now you’re both grownups,

178
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,320
but still childish.

179
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,030
Your Highness, you’re right.

180
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,030
If Cousin Luo could grow up soon

181
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,270
and is not so childish,

182
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,440
I’ll definitely get along with him.

183
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,630
Luo,

184
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,510
go to pour wine for Hua.

185
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Have you forgotten our rules?

186
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,440
Cousin Hua, please take a drink.

187
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,600
I had never been

188
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,440
served by Cousin Luo in my life.

189
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,150
Hua, take it slowly.

190
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,480
It’s a good thing

191
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
if they could bury the hatchet.

192
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,840
You two should

193
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,550
get along with each other in the future.

194
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,360
Your Highness, you mean it?

195
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,720
Sure, I mean it.

196
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,870
All right.

197
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,000
It’s a just trifle affair

198
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,550
between kids.

199
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,240
Forget about it.

200
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,390
Don’t take it seriously.

201
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,390
Thanks to your donation,

202
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,600
the disaster is alleviated.

203
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,120
I, on behalf of the disaster victims,

204
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,510
express gratitude to you.

205
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,870
I just did

206
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,510
what an ordinary people could do.

207
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

208
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
You didn’t see Jiang Luo’s long face.

209
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,750
when he greeted us.

210
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,910
He was wronged

211
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,720
this time.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
He wouldn’t let it go.

213
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,000
You’d better be careful.

214
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,390
I’m not afraid!

215
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,670
As long as His Majesty is around,

216
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,840
what can he do to me?

217
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,080
Moreover, I’m not an idiot,

218
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,870
neither you.

219
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,840
Why should I be afraid of him?

220
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,910
What you did is unexpected indeed.

221
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,790
The chef culprit was punished.

222
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,270
And that’s not going too far.

223
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,030
If he makes trouble again,

224
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,790
let’s work together

225
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,750
to sort him out, okay?

226
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,600
Since you recognize my performance,

227
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,200
how will you thank me?

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,000
I walk you home

229
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,510
as a thank-you gift.

230
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,240
Not enough!

231
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
Full of tricks.

232
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,200
You’re a gentleman.

233
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
A gentleman cannot behave like this.

234
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,960
I’m with you every day.

235
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,200
So I acquired some of your characters.

236
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,030
What do you mean?

237
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,750
You teased me indirectly, right?

238
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,480
I’m praising you.

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,390
You’re so clever

240
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,790
that Jiang Luo was tricked.

241
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
That’s more like it.

242
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,720
Your Grace, with your wisdom,

243
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,670
if you cheat me,

244
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,790
I would probably never know

245
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,030
and be unable to make out.

246
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,790
Even so,

247
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,150
in front of you,

248
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,720
I’m an open book to you.

249
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,030
Really, never lie to me in my life.

250
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,910
Never.

251
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Young...

252
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,670
Young Master, sorry to interrupt.

253
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,270
-What’s up?
-What’s up?

254
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
<i>To Princess Fule Ban Hua</i>
A letter from Prince Akeqi,

255
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
saying Shi Feixian’s been settled down.

256
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,960
Your Grace may rest assured.

257
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,870
On the eve of Feixian’s confession,

258
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,630
His Majesty met with me

259
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,080
and seemed to ask us

260
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,120
to properly handle this

261
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,200
for Prince Luo.

262
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,790
Qizhou event will not be investigated.

263
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,480
Mr. Shi, if so,

264
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,240
you could be relieved about
the letter written in blood.

265
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,480
For safety, we must make attempts

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
to get the letter.

267
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,870
Sir, you’re right.

268
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,320
I’ll handle this immediately.

269
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,720
I have news about Miss Shi.

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,030
Miss Shi encountered robbers in exile.

271
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,550
When are you going to act?

272
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,390
Shi Feixian was exiled.

273
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,670
How dare you kill her!

274
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,630
You knew my affection to her,

275
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,120
but tried to kill her

276
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,870
under my nose.

277
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,790
Xie Chongjin,

278
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,510
do you really think
I dare not to kill you?

279
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,390
I planned this

280
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,480
for your good.

281
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,270
For my good?

282
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,960
Shi Feixian’s exile to Xizhou

283
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,550
was also for my good.

284
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,720
Xie Chongjin, am I a fool?

285
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,240
You fear that Shi Feixian will be

286
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,550
my empress rather than your sister,

287
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,030
so you took the chance
to get rid of her.

288
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
Your Highness,

289
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,840
you’ll wrest with Crown Prince
in the future.

290
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,960
To weaken Crown Prince

291
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,630
will be bound to affect the Shi family.

292
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,320
If Shi Feixian does not

293
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,360
break with her family,

294
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,030
you’ll then have scruples

295
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,120
and be kept in the air.

296
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,240
It’s useless to talk more.

297
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,670
Please give me a chance

298
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,120
to prove my loyalty.

299
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,550
Fine.

300
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,000
I’ll give you another chance.

301
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,000
Bring Shi Feixian back

302
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,200
and my commitment remains unchanged.

303
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,000
If Shi Feixian was injured,

304
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
I’ll have your life.

305
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,080
Ten.

306
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,240
Your Grace.

307
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,960
Higher.

308
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Your Grace, a letter
from Count Cheng’an.

309
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,240
A letter from Count Cheng’an.

310
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,030
Must be a love letter.

311
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,630
Stop, sit down!

312
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Which is more important,

313
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,630
playing cards with me
or reading the letter?

314
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah, let’s finish this round.

315
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,390
Come.

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,480
Father, let’s take some rest

317
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,590
and allow me to read it first.

318
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,400
Forget it.

319
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,550
Gamble knows no kinship. Your turn.

320
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,270
Eight.

321
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,070
-Father.
-Follow up.

322
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,960
Let’s read it.

323
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,790
I wonder how to write love letters.

324
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,240
You?

325
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,160
Who will take a fancy to you?

326
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,680
Hua, it’s your turn.

327
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,070
Right, show your card.

328
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,160
Hurry up.

329
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,030
Read to me.

330
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,160
This is a love letter.

331
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,270
Grab Hua a cup of tea.

332
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,960
No.

333
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,510
I have two cards left
but you still have seven.

334
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
If you win,

335
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,550
I’ll return your letter.

336
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,880
Show your card.

337
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,070
A ten.

338
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,790
No higher ones, right?

339
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,830
Go on.

340
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,640
Three, four, five, six, seven,
eight and nine.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
I’m out.

342
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,000
Father, my letter.

343
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,750
I quit. What kind of silly game.

344
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,960
-How can’t you afford to lose.
-I’m out.

345
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,400
On the moor is the creeping grass…

346
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,590
What’s this word?

347
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,400
I know.

348
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,460
On the moor is the creeping grass;
Heavily covered with dew!

349
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,200
On the moor is the creeping grass;
Heavily covered with dew!

350
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,400
Heavily covered with dew?

351
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,510
Dear, what does he want to say?

352
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,030
Wild grass is stretching.

353
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,510
Dew gathered on the grass, sparkling.

354
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Three, four, five, six, and seven.

355
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,830
Sparkling?

356
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,590
One more sentence.

357
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,310
There was a beautiful man;
Lovely, with clear eyes!

358
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,680
Lovely...

359
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,720
Lovely, with clear eyes?

360
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,350
That is to say,
Hua’s as beautiful as Xie Wanyu.

361
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,400
No way.

362
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,880
Hua’s more beautiful than her.

363
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
-Exactly.
-You’re too much

364
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,030
I got it.

365
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,920
He asked Hua to a tryst...

366
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,400
We met together accidentally;
And he and I were happy together.

367
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,350
Her Grace is asked to run away with him.

368
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,440
No, it’s not.

369
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,480
Yes, it is.

370
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,790
And he and I were hiding together.

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,160
That means Count Cheng’an wanted to

372
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,920
run away with you.

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,920
Nonsense.

374
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Full of beans.

375
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,720
He didn’t

376
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,510
mean that.

377
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,510
Run away with you.

378
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,270
Lovely, with clear eyes!

379
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,400
It must not refer to Xie Wanyu.

380
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,590
-It means runaway.
-No.

381
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,550
-Indeed, run away with you.
-Impossible.

382
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,480
-That’s not the point.
-No.

383
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,640
-Hua.
-Run away with you.

384
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,350
Hua.

385
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,200
I’m right.

386
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,550
I learned this poem.

387
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,440
Well, explain it to me.

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,030
The first two sentences.

389
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,400
On the moor is the creeping grass;

390
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,400
Heavily covered with dew!

391
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,070
There was a beautiful man;

392
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,750
Lovely, with clear eyes!

393
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,880
The beautiful man is you.

394
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,510
So sensational.

395
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,590
How about

396
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,720
the last two sentences?

397
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
That doesn’t mean running away.

398
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,830
Am I right?

399
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,590
Not that point.

400
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,550
These two sentences mean

401
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,790
he would like to

402
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,240
spend the rest of his life with you.

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,110
Shunzi, well done.

404
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,550
Your Grace.

405
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,880
Count Cheng’an

406
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,590
expressed his love to you.

407
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,110
For a knowledgeable person,

408
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,590
love is a trouble.

409
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,590
That’s true. So complicated.

410
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,480
He must’ve made things difficult.

411
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,240
I’m going to come after him.

412
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,640
You quit the game?

413
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
Let’s play more rounds.

414
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,030
Hua.

415
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,510
Your Grace,

416
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,750
what are you doing here?

417
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,030
Hua, I heard from Du Jiu

418
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,590
you’re playing cards with Duke Ban.

419
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,830
I felt bored

420
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,440
so I came here to fly a kite.

421
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,590
Kite?

422
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,480
Your Grace, you made the kite?

423
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,510
I have planned to make it.

424
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,030
But, it’s more difficult

425
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,550
than I imagined.

426
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,680
Well.

427
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,240
Shunzi.

428
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,030
Write what you want to say

429
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,750
to your family on the kite

430
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,200
and fly it to the sky.

431
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,790
Then the family in heaven will know.

432
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,720
Is it true?

433
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,430
Yes.

434
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Shunzi, what do you want to write?

435
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,000
You know?

436
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,200
It’s said that

437
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,350
as long as you fly the kite
with someone,

438
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,400
you two will never be separated

439
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
as if tied together by the line.

440
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,280
Is it true?

441
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,630
Yes.

443
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,550
Sir, Zhao Shunzi’s belongings
were searched,

444
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,510
but no letter written in blood

445
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,790
was found.

446
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I felt uneasy

447
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,590
if the letter can’t be found.

448
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,270
Now Zhao Shunzi

449
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,030
becomes my biggest concern.

450
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,920
You mean we should

451
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,160
kill him for safety?

452
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,550
Do it quickly and clearly,

453
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,680
but,

454
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,000
do not let them get anything on us.

455
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,550
Yes.

456
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,240
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

457
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,030
Count Cheng’an.

458
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,880
You shouldn’t be here.
It’s against the rules.

459
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,680
Who exactly killed Mr. Rong?

460
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,350
This way.

461
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,660
<i>Kill Mr. Rong and reward 300 tales.
From Wu, the Shis’ assistant.</i>

462
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,110
Kill Mr. Rong

463
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,790
and reward 300 tales.

464
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,350
From Wu, the Shis’ assistant.

465
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,110
I got it, thank you.

466
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,300
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

467
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,960
Your Grace.

468
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,680
Why did the Shi family

469
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,240
kill Mr. Rong?

470
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,000
This probably

471
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,030
relates to the death of my parents.

472
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,350
Since I could remember,

473
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,750
I’ve investigated the past of my family.

474
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,030
Now, I’m close to the truth,

475
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,160
but Uncle Rong was killed.

476
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,960
Hua,

477
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,160
if I continue investigating,

478
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,750
you’ll probably be hurt.

479
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,960
Your Grace, don’t say so.

480
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,790
Everyone knows

481
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,350
I’m the most tough man in Daye.

482
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,440
No one dares to mess up with me.

483
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,000
So,

484
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,310
don’t worry about me.

485
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,790
But when investigating the case,

486
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,350
you need to be careful

487
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,590
and make me rest assured.

488
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,070
Okay?

489
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,510
Thank you, Hua.

490
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,480
Mr. Xie, they say

491
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,590
Count Cheng’an left Fude House,

492
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
and went to the Ban’s Mansion.

493
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,270
Till now, he is still there.

494
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,550
Hero becomes a prisoner.

495
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,240
Seems what we’ve done

496
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,440
still fails to urge Count Cheng’an

497
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,070
to make up his mind.

498
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,480
Sir, tell us your scheme.

499
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,400
We’ll follow your order.

500
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,880
The kid is still in the Ban’s Mansion,
right?

501
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,270
Yes, he is.

502
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,750
He’s kept an eye on by the Ban family.

503
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,440
If

504
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
Shi Chonghai

505
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,750
knows Zhao Shunzi will be summoned
to the Royal Palace soon.

506
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,880
Could he be patient anymore?

507
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,680
Brilliant scheme.

508
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,000
If Zhao Shunzi died,

509
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,310
Ban Hua will surely

510
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
take revenge on the Shi’s family.

511
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,160
Then, we will profit from their fight.

512
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,310
You can’t say that.

513
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,200
I just told the truth

514
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,720
to the one who should’ve known.

515
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,030
There is no profit.

516
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,830
Find a way to

517
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,720
get Zhao Shunzi out of the Ban’s Mansion

518
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,310
and provide a chance for Shi Chonghai.

519
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,350
Recently,
Zhao Shunzi always flies a kite

520
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,960
in the garden in the afternoon.

521
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,550
If the kite flies out,

522
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
there’ll be trouble.

523
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,400
Sir.

524
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,400
Sir, bad news.

525
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,400
An informant said,

526
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
Princess Ban will take Zhao Shunzi

527
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,200
to meet with His Majesty.

528
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,720
Sir.

529
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,160
Zhao Shunzi can’t meet with His Majesty.

530
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,070
Do something about it.

531
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,030
We must kill him!

532
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

533
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,260
<i>Shunzi misses you.</i>

534
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,030
Shunzi

535
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,270
Is it interesting

536
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,590
to fly a kite every day?

537
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,440
Heng, it’s full of fun.

538
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,480
Okay.

539
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,070
Let’s do some shopping after meal.

540
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,030
Great.

541
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,750
I’ll call you later.

542
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,300
<i>Shunzi misses you.</i>

543
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,110
Shunzi, it’s lunch time.

544
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,480
Where’s he heading?

545
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,110
What’s up?

546
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,920
I’ve no idea where Shunzi’s going.

547
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,590
Let’s look for him separately.

548
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,870
Shunzi!

549
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,960
Shunzi!

550
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,920
Shunzi!

551
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,110
Shunzi!

552
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,920
Shunzi! Shunzi!

553
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,750
It’s mine.

554
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
Could you return it to me?

555
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,550
Shunzi. Let’s go to eat.

556
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,640
Shunzi!

557
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,270
-Shunzi!
-Hua!

558
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,000
Shunzi!

559
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,680
Shunzi!

560
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,790
Shunzi!

561
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,550
I’ll make Shi Chonghai

562
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,480
pay with his life.

563
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,860
<i>Sky-holding Gate</i>

564
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,000
The famine is going to be solved.

565
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,030
Everyone, well done.

566
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,590
Your Majesty.

567
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,400
I have a memorial to the throne.

568
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,400
Count Rong, you’re allowed.

569
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,640
Minister Shi failed to

570
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,830
provide disaster relief,

571
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,640
leading to the famine in Qizhou.

572
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,000
Count Cheng’an.

573
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,000
How could you slander me?

574
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,110
You are corrupt

575
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,200
and even hound Official Zhao to death.

576
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,680
Zhao’s death is a natural disaster

577
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,920
and destiny.

578
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,830
It has nothing to do with me.

579
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,310
Shi Chonghai,

580
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,510
I had meant to give you the last chance.

581
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,400
But I’ve never expected…

582
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,440
Read it yourself.

583
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,000
You...

584
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,160
You...

585
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,110
Well,

586
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,110
you dare not to read it?

587
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,680
Your Majesty, I’m framed up.

588
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,510
Of 3000kg relief grain,
large portion was pocketed

589
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,480
by Mr. Shi and his party.

590
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,790
Only 900kg were left for Qizhou.

591
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,440
Official of Qizhou bought the post from

592
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
the Shis at a price of 380 taels.

593
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,680
But you lied to His Majesty that

594
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,030
the money was used
to purchase relief grain.

595
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,240
Official Zhao refused to resign

596
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,310
so you killed Mr. and Mrs. Zhao

597
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,880
and let him make way
for the new official.

598
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,550
You...You...

599
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,070
Nonsense.

600
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,400
Your Majesty,
I ask for your deliberation.

601
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,550
You utilized a fire to cover up the fact

602
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,680
but never thought
Zhao Shunzi and his grandmother

603
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
fled from Qizhou in advance.

604
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,790
You fear that the letter would be
submitted to His Majesty

605
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,000
so you built Charity House

606
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,440
to seduce to all orphans.

607
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,960
All you have done is to

608
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
stealthily lead Zhao Shunzi

609
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,400
into a trap.

610
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,510
Charity House.

611
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,750
You… Nonsense.

612
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,310
Jin, don’t trust him.

613
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,240
He’s talking nonsense.

614
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,200
But you didn’t expect

615
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,270
Shunzi’s close to the Bans.

616
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,110
Your plan failed.

617
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,110
You were driven desperate

618
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,590
so you killed him.

619
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,000
Shi Chonghai,

620
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,150
he’s still a kid.

621
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,840
Count Cheng’an, you sling mud at me.

622
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,230
I’m frank and forthright

623
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,840
and never do such evil things.

624
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,360
Your Majesty,
I ask for your deliberation.

625
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,030
Shi Chonghai,

626
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,030
this is the letter written in blood
you’ve been looking for.

627
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,800
Had it not been for your assassination,

628
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
we’d never found

629
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,800
the letter in his clothes.

630
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,710
The evidence is conclusive.

631
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,400
Do you want to defend that?

632
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,070
Shi Chonghai,

633
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,320
you’re

634
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,070
a senior official

635
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,030
witnessing my enthronement

636
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,190
and serving three emperors,

637
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,070
and also my in-laws.

638
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,550
How could you be so stupid?

639
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,000
Your Majesty,

640
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,070
I’m guilty.

641
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,760
I’m overcome by a lust for money.

642
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,440
I deserve a death penalty.

643
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Your Majesty,

644
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,760
I gave my all in my life

645
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,880
and never deceived you.

646
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,110
I do not feel ashamed before you

647
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,920
and before Daye.

648
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,190
Not ashamed before Daye?

649
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,190
You think I’ve no idea about

650
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,110
what you’ve done these years?

651
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,550
Given you’ve served three emperors,

652
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,190
I’ve been lenient with you.

653
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,800
But you’re further intensified,

654
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,280
and you killed the innocent,

655
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,880
including a kid.

656
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,000
Pass my order.

657
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,030
Official of Qizhou is sentenced to death
for buying ranks and killing people.

658
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,710
Assistant Wu is sentenced to death
for corruption.

659
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,440
The Shis...

660
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,000
Your Majesty, I beg you.

661
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,230
Show mercy to my grandchildren.

662
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,440
They’re innocent.

663
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,150
I…

664
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,920
I

665
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,110
am the only guilty person.

666
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,280
I give you the last shred of dignity.

667
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,150
Go back home and look at the last light.

668
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,920
Remove Shi Chonghai from office.

669
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,030
Imprison him some other day.

670
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,030
Even Shi Chonghai is cunning,

671
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,440
he cannot escape from my trap.

672
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,360
The Shis fell from power.

673
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,320
Now, Crown Princess

674
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,510
only has Rong Xia.

675
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,710
Congratulations.

676
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,630
Your big day is close.

677
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,480
Where’s Shi Feixian?
Have you found her?

678
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,960
Miss Shi was rescued by Prince of Aipo

679
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,360
after jumping off the cliff.

680
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,030
She’s settled in a farmer’s home
in Guxian County.

681
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,360
Sir.

682
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,000
Are you going to tell her location

683
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,840
to Prince Luo?

684
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,670
If so, everything we’ve done is in vain.

685
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,280
I will tell him.

686
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,440
But

687
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,760
it should be after Shi Feixian’s death.

688
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,230
Answer my question.

689
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,760
She’s a farmer’s home in Guxian County.

690
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,480
Great.

691
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,030
Saddle a horse.

692
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,510
I’m going to pick Xian up

693
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,670
and surprise her.

694
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,140
<i>Tomb of Zhao Shunzi</i>

695
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,190
You still got the nerve to come.

696
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,280
Your Grace.

697
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,840
Because of your family,
Shunzi lost his parents,

698
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,920
his grandmother starved to death

699
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,360
and Shunzi himself was murdered.

700
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,190
Get away.

701
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,880
Shunzi didn’t need your unction.

702
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,630
Shunzi,

703
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,630
I brought you steamed chicken.

704
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,280
You’re still growing.

705
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,110
<i>Tomb of Zhao Shunzi</i>

706
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,150
<i>Tomb of Zhao Shunzi</i>
Eat a little more.

707
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,000
Shunzi,

708
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,760
rest in peace with your parents

709
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,320
and grandmother.

710
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,590
I’m sorry.

711
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,230
I failed to protect you.

712
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,760
Hua, I promise

713
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,280
such thing will not happen again.
