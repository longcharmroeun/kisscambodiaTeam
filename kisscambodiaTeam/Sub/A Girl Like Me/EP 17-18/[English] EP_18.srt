35

<i>Episode 18</i>

36
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,230
If I remember it correctly,

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
Your Grace isn’t invited
for this poetry party.

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you interested in poems?

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,590
I’m not interested.

40
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,590
Count Cheng’an insisted,

41
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,680
so I come here..

42
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,150
Thanks for your invitation, Miss Shi.

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,520
I come with my fiancée
without prior notice.

44
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,870
Please pardon me, ladies.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,470
So it’s Princess Ban.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,960
It’s too mysterious.

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,430
If I may ask,

48
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,280
when were you engaged?

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,470
None of your business.

50
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,840
I’m not asking Your Grace.

51
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
You are not asking me.

52
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,150
Are you asking my fiancé?

53
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,030
Hua, it doesn’t matter.

54
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,590
Just a few days ago,

55
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,430
I proposed to Her Grace.

56
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,030
I humiliated myself.

57
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,470
Excuse me.

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,280
Miss Shi.

59
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,520
Let’s make it clear.

60
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,710
His Grace and I come over
by appointment.

61
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,120
But Miss Shi

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,750
leaves with tears in your eyes.

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,710
If you’re seen by outsiders,

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,960
they may think I’ve bullied you.

65
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,240
Bully me?

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
I’m afraid Your Grace thinks
too much of yourself.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,000
I’m the granddaughter of the
prime minister to three emperors,

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,710
the younger sister
of the Crown Princess.

69
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,430
I’m proficient in zither, chess,
calligraphy, painting, verses and odes.

70
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,840
What do you have to bully me?

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,630
Hua.

72
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,960
What am I working so hard for?

73
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,630
I lost to that ignorant woman.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,190
Why is it her of all women?

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,080
On beauty,

76
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,400
I will never lose to Ban Hua.

77
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,800
Ban Hua.

78
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,520
I won’t give up.

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,190
Count Cheng’an

80
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,240
must be mine.

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,920
Miss, go back to your room,

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,510
otherwise, master will get angry again.

83
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,430
My wedding has been delayed
by three months.

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
I’m idle at home.

85
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,600
Let me make steamed chicken
with scallion oil,

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
and let my brother have a taste.

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,720
No. Master specially ordered

88
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,070
not to let you in the kitchen,

89
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,630
otherwise, he’ll dock my wage.

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,480
Don’t worry.

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,310
If he docks you one tael,
I’ll compensate you with two taels.

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,160
All told, you can earn some money.

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,000
Is… Is it okay?

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes, it’s very okay.

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,510
Mr. Shi.

96
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,800
Young Master,
I tried my best,

97
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,040
but I couldn’t stop her.

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I see, let her do it.

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
You may leave.

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,040
Yes.

101
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,480
I knew you like

102
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,000
steamed chicken with scallion oil
I made.

103
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,310
But it shouldn’t be me to have it.

104
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,120
It should be your future husband.

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,600
But I haven’t married His Highness.

106
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,270
Is it proper if I

107
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,560
send a dish to him?

108
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,430
Today, you just cook.

109
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,120
But you must cook it
as well as you can.

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,360
After you finish it,
come with me to the side yard.

111
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,830
My sister heard
Your Highness was coming,

112
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,510
So she made her specialty for you.

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,040
Did she?

114
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,390
Your Highness, please have a taste.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
Steamed chicken with scallion oil
I cooked by myself.

116
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,360
I don’t eat chicken.

117
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,190
I’ll cook other dishes next time.

118
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,040
What else don’t you eat?

119
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I will avoid those.

120
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,240
Don’t bother.

121
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,190
My sister cooks very well.

122
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,360
It’s no trouble at all.

123
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,360
I eat nothing other than
what the royal cook makes.

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,070
“I eat nothing other than
what the royal cook makes”.

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,750
I’d rather feed the dog
than offer it to you.

126
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,310
-Bite it!
-Bite it!

127
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,160
Come on!

128
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,680
It’s losing.

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,870
-Bite it.
-How can it defeat mine?

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
We win at last.

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,190
-Bite!
-Bite it!

132
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,270
I’m leaving. Have fun.

133
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,240
Go away.

134
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,750
The flavors of scallion
complement the chicken perfectly.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,190
It’s tasty and refreshing
while not greasy.

136
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,720
This is the number one steamed chicken
with scallion oil I’ve ever eaten.

137
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Where did you buy the chicken?
Tell me.

138
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,870
It’s my family specialty,
not sold on the market.

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
It’s not sold?

140
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,270
I can’t buy such delicious chicken.

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,750
What if I want to eat it again?

142
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,270
Would you give me this as well?

143
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,310
Unexpectedly,

144
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,630
he is the one who understands me.

145
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,270
The mourning period for my aunt
has ended.

146
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,750
I ask you to come

147
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,390
to discuss the marriage of our children.

148
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,800
Hua is born beautiful.

149
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,630
No matter how you’re dressed,

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,800
you always look appealing.

151
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,830
Your Grace,

152
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,630
You look in high spirits because of
the happy events. It’s enviable.

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,800
I’m lucky to be with Hua.

154
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,120
Naturally, I must make some changes

155
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,950
to be worthy of Her Grace.

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
Hua’s true feelings
and true characters are very rare.

157
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,680
Count Cheng’an, you must thank me

158
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,040
to bestow you

159
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,560
such a great marriage.

160
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,120
Your Majesty, I will never
forget your kindness.

161
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Duke Ban,

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,830
have you fixed the wedding date?

163
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,510
Your Majesty,

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,390
I think we should

165
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,360
listen to the kids’ opinion.

166
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,630
Then what’s your opinion?

167
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,360
Your Majesty,

168
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,040
I’ve made an agreement with
Count Cheng’an.

169
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
He can only marry me in his life.

170
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,000
Otherwise, I’ll repudiate him,

171
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,630
taking away all my dowry
and half of his property.

172
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,270
As for the wedding date,

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I haven’t made my decision yet.

174
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,080
I’ll let Your Majesty know
when it’s decided.

175
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Your Grace, it’s against common sense,

176
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,840
isn’t it?

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,960
Well,

178
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,150
Duke Ban won’t agree surely.

179
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,320
I don’t agree.

180
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Look, Ban,

181
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,960
it’s against ritual and law.

182
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,120
It’s ridiculous.

183
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,150
What do you know about ritual and law?

184
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,270
So, as you say,

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Count Cheng’an would better
marry into her family.

186
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,910
Your Majesty,

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,750
I’ll only marry Her Grace
in my life,

188
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
and won’t have a concubine.

189
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
No matter how many terms
Her Grace proposes,

190
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,840
I’ll accept with pleasure.

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
Count Cheng’an is right.

192
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,840
It’s your business.

193
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
You must decide for yourselves.

194
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,510
Once the date is decided,

195
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,320
we must hold a splendid wedding.

196
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,440
Your Majesty,

197
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,120
about my daughter
and Prince Luos’ marriage,

198
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,000
you may…

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,550
I’ve ordered the Astronomical Bureau
to choose a new date.

200
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,120
A splendid wedding will be held too.

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,670
Your Majesty,
thank you for your kindness.

202
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,600
Silk flowers! Silk flowers!

203
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,910
Buy some silk flowers.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Silk flowers! Silk flowers!

205
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,750
Young lady,

206
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,200
these are the most popular
silk flowers in the capital.

207
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,670
Would you like to buy one?

208
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,150
Please buy one.

209
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,910
Your Grace.

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,030
No.

211
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,120
You’re so beautiful!

212
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,550
Not half so beautiful as you are.

213
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,910
Young Master, you and the madam
are really close.

214
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,030
Mammy, I haven’t married him yet.

215
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,670
I’m dim-sighted and say it wrong.

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,550
Please forgive me.

217
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:01,960
Never mind.

218
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,120
She is about to marry me.

219
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,150
It’s just a matter of time
to call her madam.

220
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,240
Wish you a long lasting
harmonious union.

221
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,840
Have a lovely baby soon.

222
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,720
Mammy.

223
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,630
I’ll buy all of your silk flowers.

224
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,510
Thanks. Young Master and Young Lady.

225
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,870
Thank you very much.

226
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,440
Your Grace, you’re going to
wear them all the time, aren’t you?

227
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,630
As long as you like it, why not?

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,550
What’s up?

229
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,550
Nothing. I could be wrong.

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,080
The man seemed to be Jiang Luo.

231
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,910
Come on.

232
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,870
Jiang Luo is suspicious.

233
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,600
I must find out what he’s doing.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,630
Feixian.

235
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,510
Feixian.

236
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,480
Your Highness, you’re engaged.

237
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,790
You mustn’t be rash.

238
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,150
The engagement is my father’s will.
I can’t violate it.

239
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,600
You know I only love you.

240
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,000
I’m wondering

241
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,480
how true

242
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,360
your love is?

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,080
You invite me here today.

244
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,670
Seems you need my help.

245
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,840
I want to destroy a person.

246
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,000
If it’s Ban Hua, I’d love to.

247
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you serious?

248
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,910
Where did Jiang Luo go?

249
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,150
But I have conditions.

250
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,440
If you can do it,

251
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,030
I

252
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,390
must satisfy you.

253
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,120
Ban Hua!

254
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,440
A prince to be married

255
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,870
does such a thing.

256
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,150
Aren’t you ridiculous?

257
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,870
Ban Hua, if you dare to tell,

258
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,080
I must skin you.

259
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Are you scaring me?

260
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,840
I don’t buy it.

261
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,360
What do you want?

262
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,150
I want you to apologize to her.

263
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,080
Well, are you unwilling to?

264
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,200
Do you want me to tell His Majesty,

265
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,390
and ask him to give the order?

266
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,030
Fine. I apologize.

267
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,200
Feixian, I’ll never be disloyal to you.

268
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,960
Don’t worry.

269
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,870
I’ll keep all the words I said just now

270
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,630
as long as you…

271
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,720
Ban Hua!

272
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,870
Now you’re making an apology.

273
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,120
Are you done?

274
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
Get out if you are done.

275
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,960
Don’t worry.

276
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,870
Although I don’t like you,

277
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,270
I’ll keep this a secret.

278
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,320
I’m not going to ruin your reputation.

279
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,030
But I shall give you some advice.

280
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,510
The day has eyes, the night has ears.

281
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,960
Jiang Luo is getting married.

282
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,270
You don’t need
another woman’s husband

283
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,030
to please you, do you?

284
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,480
Jiang Luo is perverse.

285
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,550
Avoid him as possible as you can.

286
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,440
I have many disagreements

287
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,910
with Jiang Luo and Shi Feixian.

288
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,030
It doesn’t matter to have one more.

289
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,960
Yes.

290
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,480
They’ve always been hard on you.

291
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,320
Even if you don’t mess with them,

292
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,840
they’ll mess with you.

293
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,440
But it surprises me that

294
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,120
they had a secret meeting.

295
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,080
What did they want?

296
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,080
Was it because

297
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,320
Jiang Luo tried to escape marriage?

298
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,790
Then why did he want to see
Shi Feixian?

299
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,150
Was it possible that Shi Feixian
wanted to see him?

300
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,440
No.

301
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,480
Shi Feixian is still infatuated
with His Grace.

302
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,240
She had no reason to see him.

303
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,150
Then what’s the reason?

304
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,870
Long live Your Majesty.

305
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,390
You may rise.

306
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,630
It’s this place again.

307
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,070
This time I must see clearly of him.

308
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,680
How dare you!

309
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,880
The dream was not all bad.

310
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,880
Your Grace.

311
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,310
Your Grace. Don’t you feel well?

312
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,270
Why do you get up so early

313
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,550
in order to draw here?

314
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,160
Don’t talk nonsense.

315
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,200
I’m doing something big.

316
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,350
Your Grace,

317
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,000
what strange dream have you had?

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,510
Share it with me to amuse me.

319
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,270
Be serious.

320
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,960
Today, I made up my mind.

321
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,880
From now on,

322
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,310
I will never sleep late again.

323
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,480
Now that Rong Xia
is going to marry me,

324
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,160
I must be determined to work hard

325
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,110
and never let our family
broken-down.

326
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,240
You’re right. Work hard.

327
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,790
Where did you get so many books?

328
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,550
Hua.

329
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,070
Even if you’re good at reading,

330
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,510
you don’t have to show off.

331
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,680
There’re so many books.

332
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,680
When will you finish reading them?

333
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,550
My family aren’t as rich as yours.

334
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,680
These are just ancient books,
calligraphy and paintings.

335
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,000
Don’t worry.

336
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
After you marry me,

337
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,830
I’ll share everything with you.

338
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,480
My family gets nothing else,

339
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,590
but we do have money.

340
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,920
I won’t let Your Grace get starved.

341
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,070
Thank you in advance.

342
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,590
Your Grace, are you joking?

343
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,980
<i>Ode to Spring River</i>

344
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
The Ode to Spring River
under your butts alone

345
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,720
is worth hundreds of taels of silver.

346
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,550
Hundreds of taels?

347
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,440
You read and write poems every day.

348
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,160
When did you earn so much money?

349
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,000
You just don’t know.

350
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,480
These are all left by my parents.

351
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
Our master and madam were

352
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,110
proficient in verses, odes,
calligraphy and painting.

353
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,350
They were a fairy couple

354
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,310
in harmony.

355
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,400
Du Jiu, if you have spare time,

356
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
dry some more books in the sun.

357
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,550
You haven’t married her yet,

358
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,960
but you start to help her
instead of your own family.

359
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,160
A grown man can’t be kept at home.

360
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,480
In harmony. Fairy couple.

361
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,110
I’m screwed.

362
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,590
I’m not good at zither-playing, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

363
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,070
What should I do in the future?

364
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,550
I wonder

365
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,640
if Your Grace can play zither?

366
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,500

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,200
Your zither isn’t in good quality.

370
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Playing zither is like
practicing martial arts.

371
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,830
It’s difficult to make achievements
without years of hard work.

372
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,350
Do you really want to learn?

373
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,350
You don’t have to put forth
so much strength.

374
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,790
Rub gently. Pluck slowly.

375
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,070
Wait. Wait.

376
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,960
Come on, do me a favor.

377
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,750
My hair is tangled.

378
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,590
I’m afraid Huahua is not
as naughty as you are.

379
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,790
Can you hurry up?

380
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,400
Don’t be anxious.

381
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,440
I’ll be gentle.

382
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,310
I won’t hurt you.

383
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,590
Enough.

384
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,070
Playing zither is boring.
I want to learn something else.

385
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,440
Well.

386
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,960
I wonder if Your Grace play go?

387
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
I’ll put it

388
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,350
here.

389
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,030
No, no, no, no.

390
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,160
I’ll put it here.

391
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,400
You’re smiling. There must be a catch.

392
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,400
Then I should…

393
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,350
Here.

394
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,680
I’ll put it here.

395
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,590
Are you sure this time?

396
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,310
Trying to deceive me again?

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,350
I won’t be fooled this time.

398
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,750
Playing go

399
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,160
is like my grandfather going to war.

400
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,790
Arranging armies and embattling

401
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,070
are all about schemes.

402
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,070
I’ll put it here despite what you said.

403
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,640
Fine, if you’re determined.

404
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,550
Next game.

405
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,030
I lost again?

406
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
It’s impossible.
I was having the upper hand.

407
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
Did you scheme against me?

408
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
Hua, don’t be anxious.

409
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,350
Weigh your strength before
attacking your rival…

410
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,110
Stop it.

411
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,510
I am really troubled by you.

412
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,400
Well,

413
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,880
let’s play the last game.

414
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,400
This time,

415
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,550
you let me take back one move.

416
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,350
I’m sure I can win you.

417
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,830
But, Hua,

418
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,880
I’ve already

419
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,030
let you take back 20 moves.

420
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,790
How about I yield on this game?

421
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
20 moves already?

422
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,480
Were there so many?

423
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,110
Your Grace, I think

424
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,720
playing go is boring, too.

425
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,960
It’s not practical.

426
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,400
Right. Playing go is social grace.

427
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
It’s not practical for you.

428
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,480
Do you paint?

429
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,440
Are you painting

430
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,110
a steamed bread?

431
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,030
Of course it’s not.

432
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,640
This is a goldfish. This is a turtle.

433
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,400
You can’t blame me.

434
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,720
Turtle is hard to draw.

435
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,200
And the goldfish

436
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,200
has a long tail
which is hard to draw, too.

437
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,310
The flowing tail is the beauty
of a goldfish.

438
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,030
You’ve just started to paint.
It’s really a bit difficult.

439
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,750
Let me teach you how to
use the writing brush.

440
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,240
You’ll learn it soon
with your intelligence.

441
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,240
Moisten the edge of the brush first,

442
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,070
you’ll catch
the glistening light of waves.

443
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,200
If you had taught me early,

444
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,200
what couldn’t I learn?

445
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,790
This one is him. The other one is me.

446
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,110
They look well matched.

447
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,720
Look.

448
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,070
Painting is like
practicing martial arts.

449
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,790
Talent is important,

450
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,200
but it still needs a long time
to practice.

451
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,510
Few noble ladies are good at painting
in the capital.

452
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,880
Shi Feixian is the only one

453
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,720
who has made some achievements
through years of hard practicing.

454
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,000
Rong Xia,

455
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,400
the painting you’ve drawn
isn’t about you and me.

456
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,750
It’s about you and Shi Feixian,
isn’t it?

457
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,720
You misunderstood me.

458
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,440
I mean Shi Feixian has spent

459
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
ten years on studying calligraphy
and painting since childhood.

460
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,510
Your painting is not bad.

461
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,550
It’s just slightly inferior to hers.

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,160
Why don’t you teach her?

463
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,790
Don’t teach me anymore,
in case I become your eyesore.

464
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,000
I…

465
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,070
I won’t let you two have this.

466
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,480
Hua.

467
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,110
I…

468
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,460
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

469
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,070
It’s weird.

470
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,720
I feel different today

471
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
from yesterday while I play zither.

472
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,880
It must be because

473
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,790
you’re intelligent.

474
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,960
A word to you is sufficient.

475
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,400
Really?

476
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,110
Well…

477
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,110
I say nothing but the truth.

478
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,550
In Daye,

479
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,640
few people are better than you

480
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,590
in playing zither.

481
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,830
Over time, you’ll leave your name

482
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,480
in the history book.

483
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,880
Good.

484
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
From now on,

485
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,720
I will practice harder.

486
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,440
I must prove myself

487
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,510
to those who laugh at me.

488
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,720
Your Grace,
you’ve been playing all morning.

489
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
Your hands must be sore.

490
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,110
Why don’t you let me
give you a massage?

491
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,350
Don’t bother.

492
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,590
My hands are not sore

493
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,590
even when I play with swords.

494
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,270
This is a piece of cake.

495
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,110
Ban Hua.

496
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,680
How about I spend 12 more hours
on doing horse stance every day,

497
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,030
and you spend six hours less
on practicing zither?

498
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,270
You’re noisy.

499
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,550
Don’t interfere with my practice.

500
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,270
Step aside.

501
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,350
Master.

502
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,510
-Master.
-Are you all right?

503
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,590
I’m old.

504
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
I’m unable to stand that.

505
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,790
Could you at least

506
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,440
show your father a little pity?

507
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,030
What’s the matter with you?

508
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,270
Why don’t you let me practice?

509
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,480
Is it because

510
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,680
I’ve been playing it badly?

511
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,270
Daughter,

512
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,110
it… It’s not so badly.

513
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,880
It’s…

514
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,270
it’s just a little…

515
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,750
a little

516
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,070
unpleasant to the ear.

517
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,000
-Master.
-Master.

518
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,200
-Master.
-Master.

519
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,100
-Are you all right?
-Master.

520
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,030
Master, are you all right?

521
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,440
Take care. Take care.

522
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,110
Gentlemen, what…

523
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,310
Hua, what was happening?

524
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,070
Why did you lie to me?

525
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,750
No. Hua.

526
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,440
Actually, at one point…

527
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,880
I’ve been playing it badly.

528
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,880
Bad playing is bad.
Good playing is good.

529
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,750
You should state it outright.

530
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,310
I’ve never

531
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,400
been a person who doesn’t
listen to good advice.

532
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,310
Rong Xia, I hate being lied to,

533
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,680
especially by you.

534
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,590
Don’t teach me if you’re unwilling to.

535
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,960
Could I really stop teaching you?

536
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,960
As the saying goes,
a physician doesn’t cure himself.

537
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,000
It’s feared that skills might be
disturbed by emotions.

538
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,920
I thought it was wrong to teach you,

539
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,270
but if I don’t teach you…

540
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,200
Then don’t teach me again.

541
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,510
Don’t teach me today.
Don’t teach me tomorrow.

542
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,920
Don’t teach me in your life.

543
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,270
Cheers.

544
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,070
Heng.

545
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
I know we should consider it
in the long run.

546
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,960
But these days,

547
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,270
we fight crickets and eat out.

548
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,640
We’ve been keeping up our energy
for long.

549
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,030
It’s time to teach me

550
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,240
how to get along with Hua.

551
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,160
Let’s not regard each other
as an outsider.

552
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,510
I am the only one
who can handle her.

553
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,310
Do you know

554
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,310
in the world,

555
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,310
which man has

556
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,030
known my sister for the longest time?

557
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,510
Of course it’s you.

558
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,000
No.

559
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,030
It’s my father.

560
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,070
Do you know

561
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,350
in the world,
who knows my sister best?

562
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,030
That must be your father.

563
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,590
You’re wrong. It’s me.

564
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,480
I’ve been pissing off my sister
every day since childhood.

565
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,000
On the experience of confronting,

566
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,750
I’m unique in the world.

567
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,030
So, next,

568
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,480
you do whatever I say.

569
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,750
Yes, I’m stupid.

570
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,510
I don’t have any experience

571
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,880
on pleasing girls.

572
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,110
I’ve been following the art of war,

573
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
but I failed for so many times .

574
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,720
If you’re willing to teach me today,

575
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,160
I must learn with an open mind.

576
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,350
Heng, can you tell me

577
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,310
what the method is?

578
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,110
Since you don’t have enough experience,

579
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
let’s get more experience.

580
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,160
What is Rong Xia thinking?

581
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,830
What stops him from seeing me?

582
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,920
No girl would like such a man

583
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,310
except me.

584
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,790
I’m so mad.

585
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,480
Bad news, Your Grace.

586
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,240
Your Grace.

587
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,000
The young master took Count Cheng’an
to the brothel.

588
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,590
How dare you!

589
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,720
Today I must have a
good conversation with you.

590
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,960
Your Grace. Calm down.

591
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,350
He is a count after all.
Don’t beat him to death.

592
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,030
Rong Xia, come out.

593
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,640
Rong Xia.

594
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,880
The princess. She is the princess!

595
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,750
Your Grace, could I have your autograph?

596
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,480
In my lifetime,

597
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,680
I can actually see a living princess.

598
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,160
I’m really honored.

599
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,830
You… You know me?

600
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,880
Of course.

601
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,790
Your Grace are an idol for all of us.

602
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Your chivalrous act of rescuing Yun

603
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,830
has widely spread
all over the brothel.

604
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,070
That’s right.

605
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,510
There’s such a
generous and kind princess

606
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,680
in the world,

607
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,350
and she is so beautiful.

608
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,480
We all dream of seeing you.

609
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,680
Your Grace, your hairpin
is so beautiful.

610
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,640
Your dress is beautiful too.

611
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,750
No problem.

612
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,000
If you do me a favor,

613
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,200
in the future,

614
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,590
I’ll give all these to you.

615
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,510
You are welcome, Your Grace.
At your disposal.

616
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,240
I’m looking for my fiancé.

617
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,200
I want to know where he’s hiding.

618
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,030
Your Grace, this way.

619
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,920
Your Grace, the man you are looking for
is right here.

620
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,440
Sister, have you had dinner?

621
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,680
Ben Heng, where’s Rong Xia?

622
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,790
Tell me frankly.

623
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,310
I promise you’ll live till tomorrow.

624
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,200
My brother-in-law?

625
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,160
He is not with us.

626
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,440
Believe me.

627
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
He’s really not here.

628
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,110
Ask them if you don’t believe me.

629
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,110
That’s the truth.

630
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,350
Ever since you’re engaged,

631
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,240
nobody in Daye dares to
invite Count Cheng’an

632
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,590
to the brothel.

633
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,160
None of us dares to lie to you.

634
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,000
Then where is Rong Xia?

635
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,140
♪Paper kite blue tiles
Begonia in midsummer♪

636
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,500
♪Make jasmine tea in the room♪

637
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,140
♪Sing a song and fiddle with Pipa♪

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,340
♪Her bright smile

639
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,310
It seems that

640
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,000
I’m really not good at archery.

641
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,500
♪The rain pours down on a sunny day♪

642
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,900

♪Faith is like a flower♪

644
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,640
Rong Xia,

645
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,240
what’re you doing here?

646
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,790
Didn’t you go to the brothel?

647
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,070
I’m engaged.

648
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,680
It’s inappropriate to go to the brothel.

649
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,510
It’s disrespectful to Your Grace, too.

650
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,790
You have some consciousness.

651
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,030
I’ve been practicing for a day.

652
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,400
I just got it.

653
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,150
If you teach me archery,

654
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,070
and I’m obviously bad at it,

655
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,510
but you’ll lie to me that
I’ve made great progress.

656
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,550
It will discourage the learner.

657
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,360
It’s really inappropriate.

658
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
You really wanted to learn zither,
chess, calligraphy and painting,

659
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,920
but I didn’t take it seriously.

660
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,030
I’m the one who made all the faults.

661
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,480
Can you forgive me?

662
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,150
Being angry is bad for your health.

663
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,880
I want to learn zither, chess,
calligraphy and painting, because…

664
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,360
Never mind.

665
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,960
Your Grace, it’s not a good example.

666
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,320
I wonder how you passed

667
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,670
the imperial examination?

668
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,320
Alright. Alright.

669
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,800
I receive your instruction today.

670
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,230
Now I’m ready to listen to your advice.

671
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,360
Could you give me a chance

672
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,510
to learn archery from you?

673
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,480
Of course.

674
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,590
I’ll show you
what a good master is like.

675
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,220
<i>Mingyue House</i>

676
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,280
Host.

677
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,190
Young Master Ban.

678
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,670
What’s good here?

679
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,510
I’ll have all of them.

680
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,840
I’m lucky today.

681
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,480
I won a round sum.

682
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,630
Will my sister go to the brothel or not?

683
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,400
Surely I know that.

684
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,230
Young Master Ban, did you make a bet

685
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,440
on the princess again?

686
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,000
It’s not what it sounds like.

687
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,030
Firstly, the bet was to test
my sister’s true heart.

688
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,150
Secondly,

689
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,960
It was to deepen her feelings
for Count Cheng’an.

690
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,440
At last, it won some
pocket money for me.

691
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,150
It was good business.

692
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,150
All right. All right.

693
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,630
I’ll prepare you some good food.

694
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,230
You’re getting married tomorrow.

695
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,710
Why do you eat out at this time?

696
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
Is it because Jiang Luo
breaks the promise of marriage?

697
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,630
Of course not. Don’t talk nonsense.

698
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,480
I’m just worried

699
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,190
I can’t eat this soup any more.

700
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,360
So I come to taste it again.

701
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
You made me happy for nothing.

702
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,110
Happy for nothing?

703
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,590
What were you happy about?

704
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,880
I was happy to see your misfortune.

705
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,590
How can’t you know that?

706
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,070
What kind of man are you?

707
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,630
You just can’t bear to
see a happy person.

708
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,760
Do you think

709
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,840
it’s really happy to marry Jiang Luo?

710
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,800
Well,

711
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,070
I know this restaurant best
in the capital.

712
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,840
You’re lucky today.

713
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,510
I’ll treat you to whatever you like.

714
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,800
Thanks for your kindness.

715
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,590
I have money, too.

716
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,230
Waiter.

717
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,070
Help yourself. Come on.

718
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,480
No, thanks.

719
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,670
I’ve ordered too much.

720
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,800
Come on.

721
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,550
Then I’ll reluctantly do you a favor.

722
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,510
Hurry up.

723
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,800
This is good.

724
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,400
-Here.
-This is delicious.

725
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
Have some more. This.

726
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,510
Sister. You will be married tomorrow.

727
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,230
Why don’t you go to bed early?

728
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,840
Shi Jin.

729
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,630
I…

730
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,000
I don’t want to get married.

731
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,670
Girls always feel a little uneasy
before their wedding.

732
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,360
Don’t worry.

733
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,880
I have a good relationship
with Jiang Luo.

734
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,960
I will visit you a lot.

735
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
I’m not…

736
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,840
I just…

737
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,070
I just don’t think Prince Luo loves me.

738
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,150
But Feixian said I thought too much.

739
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,800
Shi Jin, you’re close to His Highness.

740
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,320
Do you think he really likes me?

741
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,550
Why is he marrying you
if he doesn’t like you?

742
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,510
But I suggest you to stay away

743
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,030
from Shi Feixian.

744
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,480
Is it because of the Crown Princess?

745
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,190
You’re over-worried.

746
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,550
Feixian said,

747
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,400
it was our elders’ business.

748
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,800
It has nothing to do with us.

749
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,440
No matter what’s in Jiang Luo’s mind,

750
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
I promise you,

751
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,760
nobody can shake your position

752
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,280
as the prince’s wife.

Actually,

755
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,440
archery is not difficult.

756
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,670
You are a quick learner.

757
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
Writing and painting are difficult.

758
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,000
But you are good at them.

759
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,590
As for archery, as long as you
practice hard,

760
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,000
I’m sure you’ll become the
second best archer in Daye.

761
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,150
From now on, you’ll teach
me painting

762
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,710
and I’ll teach you archery.

763
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,280
If you don’t like that,

764
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,800
you don’t have to learn that.

765
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,880
Painting and calligraphy are supposed to
contribute to our peace of mind.

766
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,800
You don’t have to learn that.

767
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,480
But if we’re together in the future

768
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,800
and I don’t know anything,

769
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,110
how can we be in harmony

770
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,510
and make a fairy couple?

771
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
Hua, you’re wrong.

772
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,630
First,

773
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,150
we will surely be together
in the future.

774
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,320
Second,

775
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,190
you are good at lots of things.

776
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,320
You like riding, archery,

777
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,030
beautiful dresses

778
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,440
and delicious desserts.

779
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,110
I like all of those, too.

780
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,320
You and I have been much closer.

781
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,030
I’ll take care of the rest, okay?

782
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,400
Since you say so,

783
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,070
it’s okay.

784
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,550
Though I like zither, chess,
calligraphy, and painting,

785
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,880
I can reluctantly give them up for you.

786
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,030
Could I reluctantly give archery up?

787
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,550
No, you can’t.

788
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,400
All right. I’ll listen to you.

789
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,590
I must practice it hard

790
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,230
in order to become a brilliant student
of yours as soon as possible.

791
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,280
For the sake of your obedience,

792
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,440
I’ll give you a reward.

793
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,360
How do you want to reward me?

794
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,150
Stay still.

795
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,110
See you at the range tomorrow.
