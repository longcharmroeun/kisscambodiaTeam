LAW SCHOOL

2
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,728
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS, CASES
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

3
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:28,405
CALLS

4
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,826
I said I did it alone because of a grudge!

5
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,870
No one put me up to it!

6
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,499
Stop taking wrong guesses.

7
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,002
Please excuse me.

8
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,684
I'm on my way now.

9
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:07,111
I'm here.

10
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,086
I just arrived.

11
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:07,046
It's the table under a beach umbrella
with a lit candle.

12
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:55,803
You promised you'd find him,
so keep your promise.

13
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:09,900
Is that my son?

14
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:13,320
Man, look.

15
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:16,782
You found my son!

16
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:39,930
Hey, grab your seats.

17
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,974
Sol, come on.

18
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,059
Look at the time. It's an ungodly hour.

19
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,978
You have no time with your internships,

20
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,521
so just give me an hour.

21
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:51,108
I start at the prosecutors' office,
so I couldn't even sleep.

22
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,526
You were snoring all night.

23
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,779
Joon-hwi is going there with you,
but he's not complaining at all.

24
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,323
Did you stay here all night?

25
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:01,785
I looked through
the precedents of jury trials,

26
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,913
but not many of the cases I found
were ruled acts of self-defense

27
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,207
in both regular trials and jury trials.

28
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,586
Jurors also rarely rule a case
for self-defense.

29
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,715
Only one case was ruled self-defense?

30
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,887
Which means jurors also have
a strict interpretation of self-defense.

31
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,722
Sex crime suspects are often acquitted,

32
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,348
and self-defense is rarely ruled.

33
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,225
Isn't that disadvantageous for Ye-seul?

34
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:26,727
Then a regular trial may be--

35
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,855
What if Ko Hyeong-su
uses his judiciary connections?

36
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:34,276
At least the judge can't rule as he likes
in a jury trial.

37
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,498
Let's go.

38
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,626
Come on in. Come on.

39
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,003
Come in.

40
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,839
So? Did you find anything
we can work with?

41
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,718
His attempt to distribute the video

42
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,012
has to be a fact
for this to be self-defense.

43
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,806
But Ko Yeong-chang insists
he took the video with consent

44
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,851
and was trying to delete it
to destroy our argument.

45
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:10,520
So we have to prove his argument is false.

46
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,190
Did he ever blackmail you through text?

47
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:19,529
He planted a spy cam in her alarm clock

48
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,950
then had the nerve to insist
he did it to keep her safe.

49
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:26,328
We may see it as a sign of a crime,
but he'll say it was love.

50
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:28,497
He's as sly as his father.

51
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,624
If you recorded him
when he blackmailed you…

52
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,459
Why are you blaming her?

53
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,419
Who does that in a relationship?

54
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,088
He even made spy cam videos.

55
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,172
When you found out,

56
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:39,925
you should've texted him
to delete it right away.

57
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,220
Should've been more thorough
as a law student.

58
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,055
She did the best she could.

59
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,390
MEDICAL REPORT: INJURY

60
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,726
If you had this,
why didn't you report him?

61
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:53,230
Well…

62
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,565
The police and the prosecution

63
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,651
already asked her that a million times.

64
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:59,569
Then you should've answered better.

65
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,614
Your statement at the police
differs from that at the prosecution.

66
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:06,159
The consistency of a victim's story
is important for sex crimes.

67
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:07,411
I think it's unfair

68
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:10,289
to find someone guilty
from consistency alone.

69
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:11,373
What if they lie well?

70
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,043
Even if they do it with consent,
they can later stick to the rape story.

71
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,586
That's not what we're saying.

72
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,587
What?

73
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,298
-What I meant was--
-I'm sorry.

74
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:22,050
It's all because of me.

75
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:23,343
Well…

76
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:25,887
Hey.

77
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,724
I mean, the evidence of his assault

78
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:31,685
doesn't prove that
he recorded the spy cam videos.

79
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,520
If someone can be this violent,

80
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:35,606
doesn't it show
he's capable of recording--

81
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,609
Did you go to dreamworld
in Yangcrates's class?

82
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:41,028
Analogical reasoning doesn't apply here.

83
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,322
Wait, it might work on the jurors

84
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,323
if we show these.

85
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,952
Before we do that,
they'll see these first.

86
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,920
Let's eat gimbap before we proceed.

87
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:02,466
Here.

88
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,015
Don't let what Sol said get to you.

89
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,268
Both she and Ji-ho can be
too straightforward and mean.

90
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,394
It's all right.

91
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,896
What she said is right.

92
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:18,982
You should go to your internship.

93
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,067
Gosh.

94
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,361
-What?
-I mean…

95
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:26,073
I'm trying to be a human rights lawyer,
but this world won't help me out.

96
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,533
How can every single office turn me down?

97
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:32,287
Even so, I can't believe you're going
to the greedy Park Geun-tae's office.

98
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:33,955
What would you learn there anyway?

99
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,083
So what about you?

100
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:39,711
Did you find anyone who'll take you?

101
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,463
Hey, at least I took this guy.

102
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,299
But you? No, thank you.

103
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,717
I'd turn you down first.

104
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,260
I got scared that you might come.

105
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:49,179
My gosh.

106
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,099
-Hello, this is Park Geun-tae--
-Hey!

107
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:53,558
What?

108
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,354
Move your beat-up car right now!

109
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:59,856
This is where I park my bike!

110
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,650
Prof. Kim wanted to see me!

111
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,403
Shut your mouth
and move your car right this instant.

112
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,072
Hurry!

113
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,201
Prof. Yang is certain
about your plagiarism.

114
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:15,247
But I began to doubt it a little
after I heard your story.

115
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:19,751
I agree that you were smart enough
to write a paper on that subject

116
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:21,169
back in middle school.

117
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:25,257
But what if you're so smart
that you can hold out like this

118
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:27,801
even after copying his paper?

119
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,012
You said you began to doubt…

120
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:34,599
if I really copied his paper.

121
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,271
If you began to be doubtful,

122
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,149
it means
Prof. Yang's conviction is dangerous.

123
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:51,908
My goodness.

124
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,876
Everyone named Kang Sol is rude.

125
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,754
-What is it?
-Attorney Park, grab a seat.

126
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:07,716
I get scared when you call me
Attorney Park, Prof. Kim.

127
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,217
Just call me Geun-tae.

128
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,260
Attorney Park.

129
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:12,554
Have you heard of Bad FaMa?

130
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,389
-What perm?
-Bad FaMa.

131
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:15,974
Yes, what kind of perm?

132
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,186
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

133
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,110
I was really excited about coming here,

134
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:29,696
but why are we assigned
to Jin Hyeong-u's office?

135
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,742
All I did was sit in his trials.

136
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,494
Do you think he'll recognize me?

137
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,205
Gosh, I'm really scared.

138
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:40,707
Joon-hwi.

139
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,001
Gosh.

140
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:44,586
Joon-hwi, wait.

141
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:46,838
Are you okay with this?

142
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:48,799
What's not to be okay with?

143
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:50,217
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

144
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,845
Hello, we're from Hankuk Law School--

145
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,180
Are you here as an intern?

146
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:56,890
Yes, my name is Cho Ye-bum.

147
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:58,850
Han Joon-hwi.

148
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,186
We meet again.

149
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,819
HYEONGSEOL ONLY STRIVES TO WIN

150
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,245
Take a seat.

151
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,420
I knew you seemed familiar.
I saw you in court.

152
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,132
So you're in a study group
with Jeon Ye-seul?

153
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,303
We are, but we aren't very close.

154
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:37,472
"We aren't close."

155
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:42,018
You'd know a law firm like ours
has very good information.

156
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,522
I believe your study group
is helping her defense.

157
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:48,316
I did it against my will
because of Prof. Yang's order,

158
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,569
and I got out before I came here.

159
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:52,737
You got out?

160
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:55,907
That was unnecessary.

161
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:03,373
One second.

162
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,419
I said take it down now.

163
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,379
I'll send the money then.

164
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,679
HYEONGSEOL LAW FIRM

165
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,950
You'll be dismissed right here
as of today.

166
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,536
-Sir.
-But here's a guarantee.

167
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,330
As soon as you pass the bar exam,

168
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:45,624
you can start at our law firm right away.

169
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,589
Seung-jae is here right now.

170
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,759
Where do you think I am?
I'm at the Prosecutors' Office.

171
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:07,979
Mr. Yu.

172
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:10,440
Have a seat.

173
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,863
You two both seem very flustered.

174
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:28,583
This law student, a future officer,

175
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,836
committed a serious crime
and hacked into people's computers.

176
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:36,466
He had the nerve to hack
professors' laptops for test questions.

177
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,553
Do you know what's funnier?

178
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:43,098
Mr. Yu's hacking incident

179
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,018
became the smoking gun in proving
defendant Yang Jong-hoon's alibi.

180
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,563
But I don't buy that as the prosecutor.

181
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,526
Shouldn't you have this case reassigned?

182
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:55,902
Reassigned?

183
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,446
-You're in charge of Prof. Yang's--
-Why?

184
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:03,159
Do you think I'll make some kind of deal
with this suspect,

185
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,661
who's Prof. Yang's student?

186
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:11,835
If you're suspicious,

187
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,921
you can question him,
Officer Han Joon-hwi.

188
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,843
You're an intern here,
so I'll let you question the defendant,

189
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,594
although others only let you sit in.

190
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,263
Here.

191
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,558
Let's see

192
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,602
how good you are, Mr. Second-Round Passer.

193
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,444
You're right.

194
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:41,906
Can assemblymen's offices
really recruit interns from law schools?

195
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:45,535
It's unusual, but I'm sure
he put it out because he could.

196
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,579
He's on the Judiciary Committee, too.

197
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:51,624
He's working very hard
even after his son got hurt.

198
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:55,712
Anyway, you're going to apply for this?

199
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:59,424
I know you didn't make it at a court
or the Constitutional Court, but this is…

200
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,259
I don't care for big-name firms,

201
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,845
and the National Assembly
sounded fun as the legislative.

202
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,515
-Do you want to join me?
-Me?

203
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:10,143
You couldn't find an internship
and couldn't sleep.

204
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:12,937
I was looking for precedents
of jury trials--

205
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:14,689
I'm not sure if they'll take you.

206
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,361
I may be desperate, but I can't go here.

207
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,030
-No, I can't.
-You can't what?

208
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:23,656
Hello.

209
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,617
You still need an internship?

210
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:30,455
An internship with Assemblyman Ko?

211
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,430
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

212
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:50,725
Are you aware that prosecution questioning
can be used as evidence?

213
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,021
My statement remains the same
as what I said to the police.

214
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:56,564
Let me clarify a few things.

215
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,276
Why did you turn yourself in?

216
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,362
Yes, you've been hacking
since the first semester.

217
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:03,780
Why at this point…

218
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,406
Go ahead.

219
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:09,661
I was afraid…

220
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,750
I could turn an innocent man
into a murderer.

221
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,847
Do you mean
you might not have turned yourself in

222
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,182
if that didn't happen to Mr. Yang?

223
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,732
Would you have continued
if you hadn't been caught?

224
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,860
That's…

225
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:48,616
Yes.

226
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,035
I could have.

227
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:55,665
If his innocence could've been proven
without your testimony,

228
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,668
you may never have come forward then.

229
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,883
Do you only feel guilty when someone dies?

230
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:09,804
What you did not only led to mistrust
of Hankuk Law School's grading system.

231
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:13,057
You also caused a relative sense of loss
to your fellow students

232
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,560
who study until the point
they look like zombies.

233
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,855
Shouldn't you have been tormented
by such reasons?

234
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:21,024
Go easy on him.

235
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:23,484
Bring him some water.

236
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,947
"I needed to stop
Mr. Yang from becoming a murderer."

237
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:30,033
Is that your conscience?

238
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:34,078
Or did Mr. Yang find out
about your hacking problem,

239
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,288
and you couldn't help but do--

240
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,290
-Joon-hwi.
-I am here…

241
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,792
on behalf of the prosecutor.

242
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:42,128
Just answer my question.

243
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:57,810
On the day of the incident,

244
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:01,439
did you really overhear the conversation

245
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,900
Mr. Yang had on the phone
with Mr. Seo Byung-ju…

246
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,111
in his office closet?

247
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,509
Are you all right?

248
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,929
Joon-hwi seemed like
a completely different person,

249
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,847
as if he's possessed by Prosecutor Jin.

250
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,266
We have so much history.

251
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,893
How can he be so harsh on you?

252
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:49,696
Seung-jae.

253
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,906
If I hadn't done that…

254
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:54,784
I know.

255
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:00,540
Seung-jae.

256
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:13,469
If it hadn't been for you,
you think I would've done that?

257
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,763
So it's better that you do it?

258
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:25,773
It's better to get bitten
by a crazy dog from another family.

259
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,859
If your own pet dog bites you…

260
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,530
it really breaks your heart right here.

261
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,952
Right.

262
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,621
Some credit is due.

263
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,959
Officer Han Joon-hwi,
you've done very well.

264
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,962
You're a born prosecutor.

265
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,466
I should learn from you.

266
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,811
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

267
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,731
So there are two Kang Sols
at Hankuk Law School.

268
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:09,442
You want to be in the judiciary,

269
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,778
so why do you want
to come and work for me?

270
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,614
I want to experience
the process of lawmaking.

271
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:18,242
Passing the Lee Man-ho Act
to turn a crisis into an opportunity

272
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:19,660
was very impressive.

273
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,581
If you let me work with you, not for you,

274
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,792
then I'll be extremely useful.

275
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,128
All right. You got the job.

276
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:38,388
You're rather shameless, aren't you?

277
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,724
How dare you come here.

278
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:43,935
KO HYEONG-SU

279
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:46,604
I barely managed to pass my year,

280
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,564
so it's tough to find an internship.

281
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,318
And you're supposed
to keep enemies closer.

282
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:53,319
Enemies?

283
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,363
Because I've been helping Ye-seul.

284
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:59,742
The one whom you interviewed before me
is also helping her out.

285
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:03,788
If you give the job only to her,
won't people get suspicious of you?

286
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,705
People may think

287
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,167
you're trying to bribe her
to find out what our defense strategy is.

288
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,962
Do you think
I'll fall for such a petty trick?

289
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:14,757
I couldn't care less about your strategy.
Get lost.

290
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,099
Assemblyman Ko will be interested in this.

291
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,313
How did you…

292
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:33,609
Prof. Kim asked if you'd be willing
to take me with that document.

293
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:39,073
Well, to the point that she'd offer this?

294
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:48,666
Jin played a smart move.

295
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,838
He made you go after Seung-jae,

296
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,550
then he'll sit back and comfort him.

297
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:05,600
I wasn't thinking.

298
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:08,728
He got the best of me.

299
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,658
You're after the culprit.

300
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:27,997
It had no fingerprints.

301
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:34,921
Width, 13 cm, length, 30 cm.
They're for a shoe size of 275 mm.

302
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:54,857
Someone who could stab the stomach at once
would have to be a doctor or a nurse.

303
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:57,735
-Or…
-You'd have to know your anatomy.

304
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,487
It was for organ trafficking.

305
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,614
Like a history of organ trading.

306
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,878
The real culprit
must've wiped the fingerprints.

307
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,672
Why didn't he destroy this?

308
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:19,882
Why do you think Ki Du-seong gave me those

309
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,676
instead of pointing to the culprit?

310
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,347
Your gut feelings could be wrong.

311
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:28,557
It means

312
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:31,894
there is someone who instigated my death
behind the real culprit.

313
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,063
Sorry?

314
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:34,981
QUESTIONNAIRE

315
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,899
I CONFIRM EVERYTHING AS THE TRUTH

316
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,234
Byeol.

317
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,111
Sol!

318
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:44,198
Is she asleep?

319
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,079
Mom, get up.

320
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:53,040
Stop avoiding me.

321
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,295
You're avoiding me
because of the notarized document, right?

322
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:07,096
You know who Ko Hyeong-su is.

323
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,516
And that he approached Byeol's dad
to shut Dan's mouth, right?

324
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,647
-You knew.
-So what if I did?

325
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:21,068
He was about to lose his organs
because of his gambling debt.

326
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:22,320
So I begged her

327
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:25,406
to help me out just that one time.

328
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,407
I did that…

329
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:30,703
because I didn't know
what that would mean for her.

330
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,166
So why are you doing this to me?

331
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,168
Why are you doing this to me?

332
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,233
I heard you were assigned
to Prosecutor Jin.

333
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:02,151
Yes.

334
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,737
Don't bring Seung-jae up. What about Choi?

335
00:24:08,324 --> 00:24:09,950
He deleted the photo of the toy.

336
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,204
Which means he's emotionally shaken.

337
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:16,916
Keep knocking on his door
until he opens up his heart.

338
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,461
I'll look for a lead
to publication of suspected crimes

339
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:21,712
next to Prosecutor Jin.

340
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:27,802
How did it go at the law firm? Doing okay?

341
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,766
Fired? You got fired? Over what?

342
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,976
Because of Ye-seul?

343
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,271
Where's Ji-ho? Is he okay?

344
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:40,648
I'm not okay.

345
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:45,319
You were there for a few days.
Did you hear anything on their strategy?

346
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:50,199
Did they ask you anything?

347
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:55,413
In return, there is something
we want to hear from you.

348
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:58,082
They wanted me to say
that Ye-seul was dating Joon-hwi.

349
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,041
MUST FIND EVIDENCE!

350
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:04,046
Their argument is that
Ye-seul was two-timing him with me.

351
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,132
They'll try to prove that to the jurors.

352
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:10,136
And they'll want to do that through you,
people I study with every day.

353
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:13,806
It'd be a jackpot
if they get it out of his roommate, Ji-ho.

354
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,850
Then they shouldn't have fired him.

355
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,935
If they hold him down,
it'd look like a deal.

356
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,353
Right.

357
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:21,230
The credibility plummets, too.

358
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,773
That's false witness anyway.

359
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,024
You're fired because…

360
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,776
I don't know if I'll say yes or no.

361
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,902
Hey, Ji-ho.

362
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,864
Didn't you catch Ko Yeong-chang
at Ye-seul's dorm

363
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:30,990
and make him sign a note?

364
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,158
Don't answer that.

365
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,535
Is there anything suspicious
in your text with her?

366
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,037
I need to shut him up. Stop talking.

367
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,667
1ST PRETRIAL HEARING

368
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,710
Starting now,

369
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,963
we will begin the pretrial hearing
of the jury trial

370
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,257
for case number 2020-GH311.

371
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,217
Your Honor.

372
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:54,388
May I request that the prosecution
do something before we begin?

373
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,725
I hope you won't play dirty

374
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:01,020
and emphasize that I'm currently
getting tried for murder charges

375
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,522
to the jurors of this jury trial.

376
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:06,108
Play dirty? What do you think of us?

377
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:07,151
Cut it out.

378
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,278
We won't do that.

379
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,199
Please begin.

380
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,202
This trial ends in a day.

381
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,370
Can you reduce the number of witnesses?

382
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,080
We selected only the ones we need.

383
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:21,790
Then let's do it over two days--

384
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,709
The jurors may get contaminated.

385
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:26,670
Are you suggesting
we'll try to bribe the jurors?

386
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:29,173
No, not you, prosecutors.

387
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,925
I meant the victim's father.

388
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:33,928
He put pressure on attorneys
to get her locked up,

389
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,429
so I ended up sitting here.

390
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:37,806
Who knows what he'll do to the jurors?

391
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,807
Defense counsel.

392
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,476
Please begin.

393
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:46,148
He can't be tried in this state.

394
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:47,650
Exactly.

395
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,902
That's why I want to show them
my situation!

396
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,153
Keep it down.

397
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,534
It was about time

398
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,037
I needed to bring up something big.

399
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:03,123
Then she brought a present from you,
Prof. Kim.

400
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,501
How could I turn her down?

401
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,878
I had no choice but to take her.

402
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:13,717
The abolition of defamation
by publicly alleging facts

403
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,845
and claiming punitive damages
through a civil case?

404
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,767
It may not be as big
as the Lee Man-ho Act,

405
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,143
but it'll be a big issue.

406
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,145
I can draw attention, too.

407
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,440
If you want attention,
you should have a press conference, too.

408
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,403
If you do it
on the day of the Bad FaMa jury trial,

409
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,821
it'll be the best timing.

410
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,990
MAKE SIMPLE COPIES ON YOUR OWN

411
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,157
Prof. Kim.

412
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,327
About the abolishment
of causing defamation by facts.

413
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,622
I don't think you should hand over
your important and hard work

414
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:45,249
to a man like Ko Hyeong-su.

415
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,835
I don't have to do the internship,
so if it was for--

416
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,420
Why would she do that for you?

417
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,589
She wouldn't give it up for you.

418
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,215
Exactly. Why would you do that?

419
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:55,384
I'm sure she has a plan.

420
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,386
Just go do your internship.

421
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:58,846
Prof. Kim.

422
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,931
You record my lectures, right?

423
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,016
What? Of course.

424
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,727
Why did you give that bill
to Assemblyman Ko?

425
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,271
What about the time
when Lee Man-ho came in?

426
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:14,612
I need to blow up this issue
so that the media will stay away

427
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,489
from reporting on his case.

428
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:21,660
The contents look
very meticulous and thorough.

429
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:23,037
It looks excellent.

430
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:28,500
Right, do you know a website
called Bad FaMa?

431
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:33,005
I heard it's a website that exposes
parents who don't pay child support.

432
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,675
Why do you ask?

433
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:40,721
I heard
the defamation suit is a jury trial.

434
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,473
When's the trial?

435
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,310
It's on the same day
as Yeong-chang's trial.

436
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,229
Is that so?

437
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:51,732
QUESTIONNAIRE

438
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:55,444
There are 41 candidates who expressed
their interest in becoming a juror.

439
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,530
Among them,
40 people sent back the questionnaires.

440
00:28:58,614 --> 00:28:59,531
You'll find information

441
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:03,035
such as their gender, age, job,
education, family relations,

442
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,912
and other basic information.

443
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,330
Supplemental questionnaire…

444
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:10,584
Come on.
You should be the most invested in this.

445
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:12,503
-That's not helpful.
-What are you saying?

446
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,381
About half of the ruling
is decided from the jury selection.

447
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,466
The battle here is the most furious.

448
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,052
To find jurors
who'll rule in Ye-seul's favor…

449
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,220
Give it a good try.

450
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,262
Hey.

451
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:23,806
Prof. Yang--

452
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,975
Prof. Yang.

453
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,187
What's with him?

454
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,607
He volunteered as an attorney
to turn this into a jury case.

455
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,028
How can they give this to us
two days ago, not even two weeks?

456
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,699
It's in our hands now,
so we'll make good use of this.

457
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:43,867
This might be better for her.

458
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,160
If we got this two weeks ago,

459
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,956
Ko's side would've run background checks
and had more information than us.

460
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,002
You're right. I wouldn't put it past
Ko Hyeong-su to bribe the jurors.

461
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,004
Getting favorable jurors is important,

462
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,381
but will the jurors like
Prof. Yang's style?

463
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,717
You're right.

464
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,054
The prosecution brought a star prosecutor
who won every single jury trial she had.

465
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:07,891
She captures the jurors with her charms.
Her name even means "juror," Bae Sim-won.

466
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,895
COURT

467
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,899
Don't try to teach the jurors.

468
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,777
You can't press on them
or push them like your students.

469
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,615
And that face.
Don't make that face before the jurors.

470
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:28,078
Don't. You have to present yourself
looking very sharp.

471
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,665
Jury trials are different
from criminal trials.

472
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,208
To get on their good side--

473
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,961
I'm not going to do that.
Facts and legal principles--

474
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:37,546
That's not all.

475
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,882
Are you going to ruin Ye-seul's trial?

476
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,550
In order to persuade the jurors

477
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,136
who have good ethics
but minimal legal principles,

478
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,722
your impression and attitude matter.

479
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:51,143
The more you seem likable,
the easier it is to persuade them.

480
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:54,813
That's why Prosecutor Bae
is good at jury trials.

481
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,316
She's your biggest enemy.

482
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,942
So was Jin Hyeong-u.

483
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:02,279
But you never turned him down.
Back in the training institution--

484
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:03,864
You turned me down coldly.

485
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,077
Long time no see.
It's great to see you, my friend.

486
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,328
Sure, nice to see you.

487
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,038
He turned me down ages ago.

488
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:13,373
I wouldn't hold a grudge to this day…

489
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,125
No, I would. I liked you that much.

490
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,919
You look the same, Jong-hoon.

491
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,715
But this fight isn't that hard.
I can leave my grudge out of this.

492
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,551
A fight in a courtroom?
You mean a dispute.

493
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,804
We'll have to see if it's hard or not.

494
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,598
You're all here.

495
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:30,933
Hey, Prosecutor Jin.

496
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,187
You heard that Prosecutor Ha's mother
passed away this morning, right?

497
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,397
I did.
And that you'll be covering for him.

498
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:40,984
It's my first time at a jury trial,
so I'll learn a lot.

499
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,697
She's the prosecutor
for the jury trial today.

500
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:49,535
These are probationary officers
from Hankuk Law School.

501
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:51,203
Nice to meet you. Learn a lot.

502
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:55,290
You probably don't know
because you're only doing trials.

503
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,919
This is the guy whom the defendant
two-timed the victim with.

504
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:04,383
Special Attorney Yang Jong-hoon
better be ready for this trial.

505
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,721
May I have a word with you?

506
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,146
The hearing will continue.

507
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,524
There was zero possibility that
it was an injection instead of drugs.

508
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,235
Did you say
the needle stabbed his stomach?

509
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,487
There was no record
in the first autopsy report.

510
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,197
That's why I disagreed,

511
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,241
to summon and check with the examiner.

512
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,702
Sadly, he couldn't be reached.

513
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,704
That's why that autopsy report was used,

514
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,622
which could've left out the information.

515
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:37,875
The examiner
who conducted the autopsy again

516
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,377
also did not see
a needle mark on his stomach.

517
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,796
He wouldn't care
if he came to tamper with the case.

518
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:47,426
Even if he did, he couldn't have
seen anything after the first autopsy.

519
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,387
Yu Seung-jae…

520
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,765
won't speak as you wish he would.

521
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,895
Do whatever you want.

522
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,942
BILL ABOLISHING DEFAMATION BY FACTS

523
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,028
This is doubly annoying.

524
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,696
Why are we putting on a show?

525
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,823
He's doing this
on the day of his son's trial.

526
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,658
Bad FaMa's trial is today, too.

527
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:14,077
That's why this feels even worse.

528
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:17,080
Not only is he making use
of the proposal from Prof. Kim.

529
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,665
He's also slyly using Bad FaMa.

530
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,585
Bad FaMa might be using
this bill proposal instead.

531
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:22,920
What?

532
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:26,548
It abolishes defamation by facts
then offers claiming punitive damage, too.

533
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,842
Prof. Kim worked very hard on this one.

534
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:31,470
Why do you think
she handed over such great work to him?

535
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:33,222
Then her plan was…

536
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,724
Bad FaMa will benefit from this, too.

537
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,769
A strong political figure
is swaying the media, too.

538
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,812
Prof. Kim came up with a good plan.

539
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,440
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

540
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,025
ABOLISHING DEFAMATION BY FACTS

541
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,151
Hey.

542
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,820
Prosecutor Jin? All of a sudden?

543
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:52,324
Yes, the investigating prosecutor
just lost his mother.

544
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,409
Anyway, that sly man.

545
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,454
The only thing he told us
was to come and sit at his trial,

546
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,498
and it was Ye-seul's trial.

547
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,626
Wait.

548
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,462
Prof. Yang also found out about it
just now?

549
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,466
I'll call you back.

550
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,093
Mom.

551
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,429
What is this? What happened?

552
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:18,016
I slipped on a staircase
while handing out flyers.

553
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:19,810
I'm fine.

554
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,436
Why didn't you tell me?

555
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,772
You came here to be a juror like this?

556
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,358
They said I'll get 60,000 won
just for showing up.

557
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:31,613
I can't even make 50,000 won
for handing out flyers all day.

558
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:34,199
That's odd.
I didn't see your questionnaire.

559
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:41,248
I forgot to turn that in.

560
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,166
Is it too late to hand that in?

561
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,590
I was busy, so I forgot to turn it in.
I'm sorry.

562
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,181
I'm so nervous.
I should've taken a calming pill.

563
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,266
What if I get dropped?

564
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,768
It'd be great if you do it,
but this is done randomly.

565
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,438
If you don't make it,
watch Ye-seul's trial.

566
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,939
I really want to make it.

567
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,065
Of course he should.

568
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,652
He stopped me from defending her
to be a juror.

569
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,322
If you look so desperate,

570
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,240
there's a chance they'll drop you.

571
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,576
-So try to look indifferent.
-Okay.

572
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,828
Don't say or do anything to stand out.

573
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,456
Prof. Kim, I have to talk to you.

574
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,961
And don't appear to be
strongly opinionated.

575
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,464
Try to remain uncertain and vague.

576
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,965
Once you get selected,

577
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,385
you can show your claws
during the deliberation.

578
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,303
Okay?

579
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:37,387
I see.

580
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:39,723
Did you all get your numbers?
Did I miss anyone?

581
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,808
Me! Over here! Coming!

582
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,101
I should run. Okay.

583
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,269
I hope he gets dropped.

584
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,480
You can do it!

585
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,443
I brought my contract,

586
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,861
so let's wait here,

587
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,113
and if he gets dropped,
let's join the counsel.

588
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:57,157
You said she won't be found innocent.

589
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,825
You saw the reporters out there.

590
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:02,746
Assemblyman Ko is interested in this case,
and so should I.

591
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:03,830
My gosh.

592
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,917
If you handed over that awesome bill to Ko

593
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,919
to use it in Bad FaMa's favor
for the trial…

594
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,755
I think it's really wrong.

595
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,800
Assemblyman Ko is trying to use

596
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,469
Bad FaMa's trial
to raise his approval ratings,

597
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,554
but you're using him for Bad FaMa's trial,

598
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,515
so how are you different from him?

599
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,185
You should be different
from a guy like Ko Hyeong-su.

600
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,270
I should be.

601
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,023
It has started.

602
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:31,858
Speaking the truth

603
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,237
must be protected
under our freedom of speech.

604
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,530
PRESS CONFERENCE

605
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,573
It is unconstitutional

606
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,785
to criminally punish a person

607
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:44,121
who has spoken the truth

608
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:48,417
to protect the reputation of someone
built upon falsehood.

609
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,711
Article 307.1 of the Criminal Code

610
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,423
and Article 70.1
of the Act on Information Protection

611
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:58,009
can punish individuals
for publicizing facts.

612
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,179
I wish to abolish
defamation by alleging facts

613
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,433
and put an end to this unfair suffering

614
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,311
as the victims
are turned into perpetrators.

615
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:10,939
Once this bill passes,

616
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:13,525
defamation cases like Bad FaMa's,

617
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,694
held today as a jury trial,

618
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:19,781
will no longer be subject
to criminal penalties.

619
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,828
It's different from the deal we made!

620
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,038
Darn it.

621
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,832
Man.

622
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,918
-I will stop this.
-I came to find my son here.

623
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:32,919
Questions, please.

624
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,964
I believe a related bill
has been proposed already.

625
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,382
But it's me.

626
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,426
I'm not just proposing this.

627
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,804
I will make sure it passes,
just like the Lee Man-ho Act.

628
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:43,930
PRESS CONFERENCE

629
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:48,602
Eleven years ago,
you called me an asshole, judge.

630
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,103
You must be relieved

631
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,898
the criminal statutory limitations
and the civil statute of limitations

632
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:53,982
have expired.

633
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,068
But I'll make sure these people
who are within the statutory limitations

634
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:00,572
are punished,
and I'll file for compensation, too.

635
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,824
Look, that's not the attitude of a thief,
is it?

636
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:04,868
I'm showing the bitterness of the law.

637
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,244
After Lee Man-ho's release,

638
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:07,954
I came to know

639
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,707
that he is preparing to sue

640
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,835
those who have criticized him
for defamation.

641
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,463
I was appalled.

642
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:22,385
If he sincerely reflected on his actions
and wanted to atone for his crimes,

643
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,556
how could he do anything like this
as a human?

644
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,058
-Damn it!
-I wish to have

645
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:31,770
this bill passed as soon as possible
because of Lee Man-ho.

646
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:35,398
When you call a wicked man wicked,

647
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:39,152
it would be absurd for anyone
to be charged criminally.

648
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,119
Don't you think Lee Man-ho
will sue you for defamation?

649
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,997
All I did was state the truth.

650
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:52,707
I must

651
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,168
pass this bill before he does that.

652
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,003
Even if he sues me,

653
00:38:57,087 --> 00:39:00,715
I won't back down
and will, rather, face it gladly.

654
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,885
I will show Lee Man-ho, that wicked man,

655
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,764
what justice looks like.

656
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,230
Where are you going?

657
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,940
Oh, well…

658
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,860
You aren't on your way to the court,
are you?

659
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:22,612
Will you come with us?

660
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:23,989
Why would I go there?

661
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:27,325
It's already shameful,
so why are you two going?

662
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,955
Assemblyman Ko and I worked hard
to make sure the trial stays quiet.

663
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:37,043
Let's go watch it quietly.

664
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:42,966
People are already saying
Hankuk Law School is the hotbed of crime.

665
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,759
Only if they're both found guilty.

666
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:48,597
If they're all innocent,
this will be an amazingly valuable lesson.

667
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:54,352
So you're insisting on going there?

668
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,022
Assemblyman Ko is at the court, too.

669
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,191
Come with us.

670
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,369
COURT

671
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:09,289
And now, we will begin
the jury selection process.

672
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,876
If a juror candidate
makes a false statement

673
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:15,212
in the selection process,

674
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:19,549
you may be fined up to two million won
according to Article 60

675
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:23,553
of the Act on Citizen Participation
in Criminal Trials.

676
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,891
Now, please take a look at the screen.

677
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:34,940
Once you are seated
in the jury seat on the day of the trial,

678
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:39,111
judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel
will ask you many questions.

679
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:41,780
IN SESSION

680
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:44,282
That's the end of my internship today.

681
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,201
It took a toll on my heart.

682
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,830
His darned press interview
began to trend on the Internet,

683
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:52,666
and it drew people's attention
to Bad FaMa's trial, but…

684
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,836
And he successfully made people
forget his son's trial.

685
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,170
Is this locked?

686
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,674
This session isn't open to the public.
You can't come in.

687
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:07,222
Why are you so curious?

688
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:09,808
Prof. Yang will do a good job.

689
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:12,978
I heard Prosecutor Bae Sim-won
or someone is invincible.

690
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,647
I hope we only get jurors
who'd rule in Ye-seul's favor.

691
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:19,860
I hope he makes use of the selection
we came up with after a thorough analysis.

692
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:22,487
A civil servant in his 50s

693
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:25,490
with a 28-year-old job-seeking son,
the same age as Yeong-chang.

694
00:41:25,574 --> 00:41:26,700
We should dismiss him.

695
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,952
He'll be more empathetic
toward Ko Yeong-chang.

696
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:31,538
He has a 26-year-old daughter
who's a flight attendant.

697
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,166
Aren't dads more concerned
about their daughter than their son?

698
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,792
Yes, you might be right.

699
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:37,335
QUESTION 1: OCCUPATION

700
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:39,713
Let's keep him here.

701
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:42,883
An OB-GYN doctor couple in their 50s.

702
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:44,468
They have a 21-year-old daughter.

703
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:47,846
They'd be in our favor.

704
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:49,014
QUESTIONNAIRE

705
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,517
Joon-hwi, where should we sit?

706
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:55,979
I mean, we came with Prosecutor Jin.

707
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:59,816
You're working for the prosecutor
so you want to sit there? Go ahead.

708
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,568
It's not that we will. If we can--

709
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:02,986
You do that.

710
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,739
-Where's Ye-seul?
-She's here. I should go.

711
00:42:07,616 --> 00:42:08,617
Hey, two-timer.

712
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:11,870
It wouldn't help her
if you're seen with her.

713
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:12,954
I can go, right?

714
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:14,706
Just go be with Jin Hyeong-u.

715
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,793
Come on, I didn't mean
I absolutely want to do that.

716
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:31,973
Ye-seul.

717
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:33,683
Hey.

718
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,607
Aren't you doing your internship?
Are you allowed to be here?

719
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:46,947
Let me get you coffee.

720
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,157
No, I'll get it myself.

721
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,793
She shouldn't wear heels, right?

722
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:03,004
Be thankful that she's not wearing
red lipstick and mascara.

723
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:04,005
Have you seen Sol A?

724
00:43:04,673 --> 00:43:05,799
What about me?

725
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:07,300
It's about Bad FaMa.

726
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:08,593
What about Bad FaMa?

727
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,011
Where's Ye-seul?

728
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:12,389
Over there.

729
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:21,523
-Hello.
-Hello.

730
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:22,440
Hey.

731
00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:25,151
Good luck on your internships.

732
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,446
When you have time,
you should come and watch the trials.

733
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,364
Okay.

734
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:32,284
How many interns are here from our school?

735
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,494
-A total of seven, ma'am.
-I see.

736
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:37,706
So what's your internship like?

737
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:38,790
EXEMPTIONS

738
00:43:38,874 --> 00:43:41,918
Do any of these exemptions apply to you?

739
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:44,421
How old are you?

740
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:46,506
I'm 74.

741
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,759
You don't have to do this
if you're over 70.

742
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:53,221
It'll be really tough for you to sit there

743
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:54,806
all day long.

744
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,141
All day long?

745
00:43:56,224 --> 00:43:57,726
Yes, all day long.

746
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:01,187
Yes, sir.

747
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,731
I can't do it.

748
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:03,940
All right.

749
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:06,026
How do I become this juror or whatever?

750
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:11,156
I'm not kidding. How do I become one?

751
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:13,408
You have to raise your chances.

752
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:17,912
My 7-year-old daughter

753
00:44:17,996 --> 00:44:20,081
has a grade 1 disability
due to brain lesions,

754
00:44:20,165 --> 00:44:22,167
and she is unable to move on her own.

755
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,003
-I asked my mother to look after her--
-Goodness.

756
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:27,297
You should go be with your daughter.

757
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,675
Excuse me, Candidate 37, please be quiet.

758
00:44:30,759 --> 00:44:31,843
Yes, okay.

759
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:34,054
DEFENSE COUNSEL

760
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:36,139
Make sure you get Candidate 37!

761
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:45,273
INFORMATION ON JURY CANDIDATES

IN SESSION

767
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,303
Don't be disappointed
if you don't get chosen at first.

768
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:21,518
Do you know anyone who has suffered
or caused grievous bodily harm?

769
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:26,648
Her fiancé's mother was hit by a car
then became paraplegic.

770
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:29,442
It's grievous bodily harm.
The prosecution will choose her.

771
00:45:30,443 --> 00:45:31,361
Let's avoid her.

772
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:33,279
My boyfriend's mother was hit by a car.

773
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,031
We have much to do for the wedding,

774
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:38,410
but he makes me do everything
using his mother as an excuse.

775
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:41,913
If her future mother-in-law is disabled,
she'll be more annoyed.

776
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,416
"Why did she get into an accident?"

777
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:45,709
She's on our side.

778
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:46,960
I see.

779
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:50,880
His mother must be heartbroken
for taking up her son's time.

780
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:51,881
Sorry?

781
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,176
My nephew fought with a thief

782
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,595
then was imprisoned
for making him lose his sight.

783
00:45:57,679 --> 00:45:59,889
If he tried to stop a thief
from coming in,

784
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:02,142
he might think imprisonment was unfair.

785
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:04,269
He probably claimed self-defense.

786
00:46:04,352 --> 00:46:07,230
-Do you think his punishment is unfair?
-One second.

787
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:10,942
He said the investigation was fair.

788
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,404
He should be punished
if he made him lose his sight.

789
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:17,615
But imprisonment doesn't seem fair
since it was a thief,

790
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,033
so I think probation sounds fair.

791
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:21,703
You're right.
Then he won't agree with self-defense.

792
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:25,206
It might've been different
if it were his son.

793
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,583
Ye-seul is a stranger.

794
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:27,917
QUESTIONNAIRE

795
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:33,339
Among assault, injury, fraud,
sexual assault, murder,

796
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,300
and attempted murder,

797
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:38,470
which crime do you believe
is not punished harshly enough?

798
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:41,055
It's sexual assault, isn't it?

799
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:42,682
She's right. It's rape.

800
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,019
Look, the question asked
what she thinks of criminal punishment.

801
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:48,897
She said it's too light
then put "rape" in brackets, too.

802
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:53,818
Please!

803
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:55,487
Please make it.

804
00:46:59,908 --> 00:47:00,950
It's not light.

805
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:04,579
Criminal punishment for sexual assault
is as severe as that of murder.

806
00:47:04,662 --> 00:47:07,874
Trespassing upon a residence and rape
get you 8 to 13 years in prison

807
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:09,959
and murder gets you 10 to 16 years.

808
00:47:11,336 --> 00:47:12,962
I think he studied a bit of law.

809
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,759
"How good are you at persuading others
at meetings and work

810
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:19,427
to agree with your opinions?"

811
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:20,512
He said he's very good.

812
00:47:22,514 --> 00:47:24,307
He's a wild card.

813
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,643
What do you think
has the weakest punishment?

814
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:28,102
Assault and injury, of course.

815
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:30,063
And it's not indicted upon objection.

816
00:47:30,855 --> 00:47:33,024
You don't get punished
once you settle the case.

817
00:47:33,107 --> 00:47:34,275
What makes no sense is

818
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:36,778
how domestic violence
can't be indicted upon objection.

819
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:40,532
JURY SELECTION BOX

820
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:45,411
Defense counsel, any questions?

821
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,830
No, Your Honor.

822
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:48,122
PROSECUTION

823
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:52,752
The prosecution and the defense counsel
will now make requests

824
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,755
to have candidates evaded
for reasons and no reasons.

825
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,423
APPLICATION FOR CHALLENGE FOR REASONS

826
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,884
PROSECUTION

827
00:47:59,968 --> 00:48:01,427
APPLICATION FOR CHALLENGE

828
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:04,055
2, 18, 24 TO BE EVADED

829
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:17,944
The number 2, number 18,

830
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:23,324
and number 24 candidates
are dismissed from their candidacy.

831
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:31,416
JURY SELECTION BOX

832
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:36,671
-Number 38.
-Yes.

833
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:39,799
-Number 5.
-Yes.

834
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,094
Number 37.

835
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,430
Yes! I'm right here.

836
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,061
Number 37, you seem to have hurt your leg.
Will you be all right?

837
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:54,188
There's not a problem.

838
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,741
I have a question
for candidates 5, 37, and 38.

839
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:06,451
Let's say

840
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:09,996
my girlfriend cheated on me
while she was dating me,

841
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,206
then I asked her to break up with me.

842
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:15,168
But she couldn't accept it
and ended up causing grievous damage

843
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:17,670
while she continuously pestered me.

844
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:22,050
Should I request
to have her severely punished?

845
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:23,593
Or should I ask for mercy?

846
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:27,013
If you were once in love with her,
you should ask for mercy.

847
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:29,557
What are you talking about?

848
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:34,020
By the way,
how did you end up dating a girl like her?

849
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:37,690
Don't worry.

850
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,901
You won't have to ask
for a severe punishment.

851
00:49:39,984 --> 00:49:43,529
The law will make sure
she gets punished for what she did.

852
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,615
Isn't that right?

853
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:49,494
Exactly. A man needs to date a good woman.

854
00:49:49,577 --> 00:49:52,497
I also think what she did
is too cruel to plead for mercy.

855
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,207
Yes, that's exactly what I said.

856
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,751
Okay, please maintain order.

857
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,253
Defense counsel, questions?

858
00:49:59,337 --> 00:50:00,505
I don't have any.

859
00:50:01,506 --> 00:50:04,175
And I will continue to ask no questions.

860
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:16,771
Candidates 5, 7, 11, 37, 38,

861
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:21,484
46, 58, and 76

862
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,319
are chosen as the jury.

863
00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:28,449
In case one of the jurors

864
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:32,286
is unable to carry out their duty
due to sudden illnesses and so on,

865
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,872
we will select a reserve juror.

866
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:37,208
According to Article 31.4

867
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:39,877
of the Act on Citizen Participation
in Criminal Trials,

868
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:43,464
I will not disclose
who the reserve juror is.

869
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:47,010
The selection process is concluded.

870
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:49,512
Drink some.

871
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:53,808
Your trial will begin soon.

872
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:55,643
You'll have a tough time in there.

873
00:50:56,477 --> 00:50:57,937
Brace yourself.

874
00:51:07,488 --> 00:51:10,992
It's not your fault
that Ko Yeong-chang ended up like this.

875
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,830
You had to be examined for rape
because of him.

876
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:18,249
Just remember that.

877
00:51:23,588 --> 00:51:26,674
The prosecutor offered to suspend
his indictment.

878
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:30,636
Don't try to stop me.

879
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,889
I don't know about you,
but I can at least talk.

880
00:51:32,972 --> 00:51:35,016
I examined Ye-seul
against the president's order

881
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,684
and even came here as a witness.

882
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:37,769
Go ahead.

883
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:44,192
It wasn't easy for me
to appear here as a witness.

884
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:49,739
If you can be found innocent
without an account from his witness,

885
00:51:50,948 --> 00:51:52,575
I don't want him to stand there.

886
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,536
-Ju-yeong.
-I want to shut his mouth

887
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,163
and get his indictment suspended.

888
00:51:59,123 --> 00:52:00,166
Don't mind her.

889
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:02,043
She's just frustrated, that's all.

890
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:05,838
I heard you're a certified
digital forensic examiner.

891
00:52:07,048 --> 00:52:08,132
I am.

892
00:52:09,842 --> 00:52:13,471
Could I find out the hour
in which my client had seen this video?

893
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:15,348
Until the hearing ends.

894
00:52:17,183 --> 00:52:19,393
Professor,
please don't let him be a witness…

895
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:32,266
JEON YE-SEUL'S JURY TRIAL BEGINS

896
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:44,695
Please.

897
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,741
Dear members of the jury,

898
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:53,453
in accordance
with Article 27.4 of the Constitution,

899
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,831
we hold to the presumption of innocence.

900
00:52:56,623 --> 00:53:00,169
Which means the defendant of this trial
is presumed to be innocent

901
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:02,171
until she is found guilty.

902
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:06,633
Therefore, the defendant has
no obligation to prove her innocence.

903
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:09,511
The prosecutors must prove
she's guilty as charged

904
00:53:09,595 --> 00:53:12,848
only to the extent
that will not arouse reasonable suspicion.

905
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:16,435
What the heck is he saying?

906
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:21,023
I request the members of the jury
to rule on her case

907
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,860
solely on the evidence presented
and investigated in this court

908
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:27,696
according to the Principle of Adjudication
Based on Evidence,

909
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:29,823
Article 307 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

910
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,701
You must rule on her
solely on the evidence…

911
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:34,369
BAD FAMA'S JURY TRIAL BEGINS

912
00:53:34,453 --> 00:53:36,163
…presented and accepted in this court.

913
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:46,423
Man, this is as good as a closed trial.

914
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:48,258
It's Ko Hyeong-su's power.

915
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:49,676
Everyone is at Bad FaMa's.

916
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,261
The defendant, Jeon Ye-seul,

917
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:54,890
had been dating the victim
for three years.

918
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:59,561
They both aspired to get accepted
to Hankuk Law School in the year 2020,

919
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:03,065
but only the defendant was accepted,
not the victim.

920
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:05,025
After her enrollment,

921
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,945
the defendant did not have enough time
to meet with the victim

922
00:54:08,028 --> 00:54:09,655
due to the murderous amount of studies.

923
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:12,407
She had something going on
with a guy in her study group.

924
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:14,159
Doesn't that mean she two-timed him?

925
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:21,917
The victim, Ko Yeong-chang, found out
she had been two-timing him.

926
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,962
On December 5th, 2020, around 9:00 p.m.,

927
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:27,965
he asked her to break up with him

928
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:30,092
in the back
of the Hankuk Law School building,

929
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:33,136
but the defendant
refused to accept their breakup.

930
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:37,349
The victim, who was drunk,
called her filthy

931
00:54:38,016 --> 00:54:42,020
then tried to delete a video of them
since he wanted to break up.

932
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,357
Then the defendant assaulted the victim
in a fit of anger.

933
00:54:46,692 --> 00:54:49,611
The victim hit his head on the ground
and was grievously injured.

934
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:51,738
Goodness. Unbelievable.

935
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:58,620
Of course, the defendant probably
did not devise a plan to cause harm.

936
00:54:59,705 --> 00:55:01,373
If only they hadn't grown apart

937
00:55:01,456 --> 00:55:04,418
after the acceptance and rejection
into the school…

938
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,921
They were so deep in love
that they would've been married by now,

939
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:12,592
so much so that they agreed to film
a video of their private moment together

940
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:13,760
and cherish it forever.

941
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:22,477
The victim barely escaped death
from a fatal brain injury

942
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:23,979
and became paraplegic.

943
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,066
Therefore, we applied
Article 258 of the Criminal Code

944
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,236
and indicted her
for causing grievous bodily harm.

945
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:35,907
What she said isn't her charge
but a big fat lie! A lie!

946
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:36,992
JUROR

947
00:55:39,244 --> 00:55:41,330
GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM

948
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:45,417
If it were fun enough to make me laugh,
I would've called it a novel.

949
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,127
But it was pretty lousy.

950
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:50,505
-Defense counsel.
-I accept the warning.

951
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,436
Before I came into the trial,

952
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:07,689
my colleague gave me a good nagging.

953
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,068
She said I have to get on your good side.

954
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:16,490
She suggested that
if you don't find me likable,

955
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,451
my client would suffer or something.

956
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:24,081
-Is that the case?
-No.

957
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,252
Since I was sitting across from you,

958
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,922
I could see your confusion

959
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,300
when the judge informed you
of the presumption of innocence

960
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:37,969
and ruling solely
on the evidence presented here.

961
00:56:39,638 --> 00:56:42,516
To put it plainly,
the presumption of innocence is this.

962
00:56:43,642 --> 00:56:45,394
You may remember me from the news

963
00:56:45,477 --> 00:56:48,814
as a defendant on trial
in the law school murder case.

964
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,944
However, I made a special request
to the judiciary

965
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:56,738
to take up her case as an attorney.

966
00:56:56,822 --> 00:57:01,284
They did not hold to any prejudice
and presumed I was innocent

967
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:04,538
because I haven't been found guilty
at my trial

968
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,708
and accepted my request.

969
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,293
They presented

970
00:57:10,377 --> 00:57:14,256
that a defendant shouldn't be treated
as a criminal.

971
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,680
If any of your family or friends
suffered from grievous bodily harm,

972
00:57:21,763 --> 00:57:24,015
would you blindly judge
against the defendant

973
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:26,143
just because she's charged with that?

974
00:57:27,853 --> 00:57:30,355
Or since a person's life is at stake,

975
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:33,525
would you try to make a fair judgment
apart from your personal feelings,

976
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:35,277
solely grounded on the evidence?

977
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:39,656
If you just nodded,

978
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,368
you understood what it means
to rule only on the evidence presented.

979
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:48,081
There are no jurors who are advantageous
or disadvantageous to the defendant.

980
00:57:48,749 --> 00:57:52,169
There is only advantageous
or disadvantageous evidence.

981
00:57:52,753 --> 00:57:55,964
We just need you to make a decision
solely on the evidence.

982
00:57:57,924 --> 00:58:02,012
Even if you know anybody who suffered
from domestic violence or dating abuse,

983
00:58:02,095 --> 00:58:04,222
please do not show
any pity or sympathy for her.

984
00:58:07,809 --> 00:58:09,311
The fact of the incident is this.

985
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,063
The defendant
was in an abusive relationship.

986
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:13,231
The accident happened

987
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:16,526
as she tried to stop the victim
from spreading their spy cam sex video.

988
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,405
We claim self-defense in accordance
with Article 21 of the Criminal Code.

989
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,576
CRIMINAL CODE ARTICLE 21: SELF-DEFENSE

990
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:33,418
Is this really his first time
at a jury trial?

991
00:58:33,502 --> 00:58:35,128
It's his first time as counsel.

992
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,214
PROSECUTION

993
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:41,134
Look at how he turned
all of our hard all-nighters into nothing.

994
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,428
But I really want to give credit
to Attorney Yang.

995
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,557
He had the jury and the judges
completely under control.

996
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:50,060
Did you see the prosecutors
and Ko's attorneys?

997
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:52,062
Especially how Prosecutor Jin looked grim.

998
00:58:56,316 --> 00:58:58,401
-Let's go for lunch.
-Yes, sir.

999
00:58:59,611 --> 00:59:01,112
I'll be testifying later.

1000
00:59:01,196 --> 00:59:03,990
There's no need to sit with him
and cause a misunderstanding.

1001
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,033
Let's go.

1002
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,376
-Hello?
-Go.

1003
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,964
What did you say?

1004
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:25,053
YOUR CASE IS TRANSFERRED
TO THE PROSECUTION

1005
00:59:25,136 --> 00:59:27,472
Prosecutor Jin's case
isn't transferred yet, right?

1006
00:59:27,556 --> 00:59:29,391
It got transferred to be indicted.

1007
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:31,977
You surprised me.

1008
00:59:33,854 --> 00:59:34,688
Okay.

1009
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:37,399
So what? They'll acquit in that case.

1010
00:59:37,482 --> 00:59:38,775
That's why you should…

1011
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:40,485
What?

1012
00:59:40,569 --> 00:59:43,822
You just put a straw in my drink
then expect me to betray Prosecutor Jin?

1013
00:59:43,905 --> 00:59:45,448
You did that to my dad.

1014
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:49,119
What happened to your dad is…

1015
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:56,501
Fine, I honestly had no idea
that the toy my son loves so much

1016
00:59:56,585 --> 00:59:58,628
was made by your father.

1017
00:59:58,712 --> 01:00:00,589
-If I had known--
-You know that now.

1018
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:03,008
So testify that he slipped it to you.

1019
01:00:03,091 --> 01:00:04,259
I can't!

1020
01:00:06,511 --> 01:00:07,721
I can't do it.

1021
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,891
What if my career as a reporter ends?
Will you take responsibility?

1022
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:13,643
Let the living live on.

1023
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:16,438
I'll give you something more interesting.

1024
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,943
-What do you think about this?
-Let's talk about it later.

1025
01:00:22,027 --> 01:00:23,236
All right, everyone.

1026
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,948
-Say something.
-We're in front of the sacred court.

1027
01:00:27,032 --> 01:00:29,618
We shouldn't make a fuss here.
Let's do this later.

1028
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:30,619
-One second!
-Mr. Ko!

1029
01:00:30,702 --> 01:00:32,412
You want to write a piece on Ko?

1030
01:00:34,247 --> 01:00:36,583
I'll help you report huge exclusive news,
Mr. Choi.

1031
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,003
What?

1032
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:45,759
It's been received very well.

1033
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:49,262
They're more excited than the time
when you passed the Lee Man-ho Act.

1034
01:00:51,306 --> 01:00:52,307
What about Yeong-chang?

1035
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:54,976
Attorney Song told you not to worry.

1036
01:00:55,602 --> 01:00:56,811
Tell him to end it soon.

1037
01:00:56,895 --> 01:00:59,189
I'll be at Bad FaMa's court after lunch.

1038
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:21,336
-Damn you.
-Hey, you!

1039
01:01:22,963 --> 01:01:25,298
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

1040
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,676
You can't do this to me!

1041
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:28,760
Let go…

1042
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:33,348
That's not enough to kill him.

1043
01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:34,349
Damn it.

1044
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,895
-Choke him harder!
-Stay away.

1045
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,651
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

1046
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,319
PROSECUTION

1047
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,206
Is the defense counsel not here yet?

1048
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:02,168
Don't come closer.

1049
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:07,424
Kill him.

1050
01:02:26,586 --> 01:02:32,578
Subtitle translation by Eun Sook Youn

1051
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,001
How this ended up in my hands…

1052
01:02:43,084 --> 01:02:44,878
I thought she looked familiar.

1053
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,796
-I never forget a face.
-Tell me!

1054
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,799
For what reason did he make you do that?

1055
01:02:49,883 --> 01:02:51,509
Shouldn't you be suspicious of it?

1056
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:54,137
Why do you think
Prosecutor Jin attended Ye-seul's trial?

1057
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:55,305
By chance?

1058
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:59,142
Actually, the one you stabbed
in the back is not me.

1059
01:03:00,018 --> 01:03:01,061
My apologies.

1060
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,937
The victim wanted to be here,
so I brought him.

1061
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:05,899
I'll gladly be called a rapist.

1062
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,902
Are you saying you were raped
though you actually had sex with him?

1063
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,321
I resign.

1064
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,156
I can no longer represent Ms. Jeon.
