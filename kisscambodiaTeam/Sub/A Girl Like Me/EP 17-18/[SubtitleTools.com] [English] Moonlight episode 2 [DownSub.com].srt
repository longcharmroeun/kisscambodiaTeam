Our deputy editor wants me

14
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,090
to talk to you about
the new book contract.

It's 2070 though.

No.

29

I'm truly sorry, Mr Zhou Chuan.

30
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,030
For talking to you like this.

If I don't see you today, I need to...

Scram!

34
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,990
Hello, is this management department?

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,350
Mr Zhou, I'm really not a con artist.

36
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,750
I can explain.

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

38

you're disturbing the residents.

Is there any misunderstanding?

I'm here for a business talk.

46

Do you still remember me?

56

We met during your visit to
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

57
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,990
Indeed.

58
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,040
You even embarrassed me
in front of everyone.

59

I know this girl. Let her go.

60

Thank you, Ms Gu.

62

I thought you're smart.

63
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,010
As a girl, you should remain decent.

64
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,810
Since Zhou Chuan refuses to show himself,
you won't get to see him.

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,149
You should get going.

66
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,920
Had you signed the new book contract
with Xin Dun Books earlier,

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,590
you'd have been living in peace, right?

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,640
You're full of perseverance indeed.

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,820
You came to find me right after
being transferred from Beijing.

70
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,840
How much pressure does Xin Dun Books

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,920
put on you when it comes to the KPIs?

72
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,870
I know.

73
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,180
You refuse to sign
the contract with Xin Dun Books

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,170
because you want to
see if there's any company

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,150
who can offer you a higher price.

76
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,850
But I'd say Xin Dun Books
offers the best conditions.

77
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,320
Does it?

78
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,550
When I signed
the Oriental Beauty with you guys,

79
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,110
I really didn't feel that way.

80
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,110
This time, we don't plan to set
a minimum number of printed copies.

81
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,400
Five million yuan.

82
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,510
To buy the full copyright of the book.

83
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,950
Well, that can save me a lot of trouble.

84
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,400
But I'm afraid I will repeat
Jiang Yu Cheng's mistake.

85
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,290
If you were to reject me because of this,

86
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,550
that'd be so irrational of you.

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,120

Mr Zhou Chuan, why don't you

105

have a listen to the contract conditions

106
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,740

Mr Zhou Chuan, are you listening?

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,190
Turn to the first page of the contract.

Read out the amount.

-Sure.

Monstress said the same thing just now.

What a pity.

I went to meet Mr Zhou Chuan.

134
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,430
But he's very dissatisfied
with our contract.

135
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,290
Could we increase
the minimum number of printed copies?

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,130
Do you know what is
a minimum number of printed copies?

137
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,230
A minimum number of
printed copies is a figure

138
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,670
given by the circulation department

139
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,160
after a market analysis based on
the author's previous sales.

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,540
No one can simply change it.

141

Well, I've got something on.

The minimum amount is
three thousand copies.

Not more than that.

147

But the editors in charge...

148

What do the editors know?

149
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,990

how many copies can an author sell.

157

He's a new author.

What do we do if we don't sell them out?

Paste them on the wall?

162

Hello, Mr Liang.

173

I'm Chu Li from the second section.

174
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,200
And I'd like to ask you to increase

175

Mr Zhou Chuan's new book.

If I remember correctly,

179
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,680
I've decided on his minimum number
of printed copies long ago.

If that's the case,
why are you here to find me?

182

Are you doubtful about my decision?

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,120
Or do you think you did

184

better homework than me?

185

Listen.

Zhou Chuan's minimum number of
printed copies cannot be changed.

to hand the contract to him
and have it thrown at my face.

Is it because you're
not good at negotiating?

How many

239
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,030

think we should give him?

240
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,820
One hundred thousand.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
The first royalty for an author

242
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,030
is determined by the minimum
number of printed copies.

243
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,600
If he manages to receive a royalty of 15%,

244
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,650
that's impressive enough.

245

The figure he receives

246
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,590

three to five thousand yuan.

261

262
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
thirty thousand yuan
for his first payment.

263

And we increased it
to forty thousand yuan.

264

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,790
You're not worth my time.

334
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,120
Take it away.

335
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,320
All right, I'm hanging up.

336
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,280
Rest early.

337
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,360
Bye-bye.

338
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,530
Bye-bye. Miss you.

339
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,660
[Lass.]

340
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,970
[Dad]

341
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,600
[I've transferred you some money.
Get yourself a new phone.]

342
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,620
[You're all alone out there.
Take good care of yourself.]

343
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,330
[Don't be so hard on yourself.]

344
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,349
Auntie Zhang.

345
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,280
You can't come to clean for this month?

346
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,500
Sure, get well soon.

347
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,690
Got it.

348
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,000
Morning, Er Gou.

349
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,000
Stop barking.

350
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,390
[Er Gou.]

351
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,760
Stop barking.

352
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,420
Your house is not here.

353
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,310
Let's go. It's the one behind here.

354
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,120
Er Gou.

355
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,790
It's really you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

356
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,670
Mr Zhou Chuan.

357
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm sorry for keep bothering you.

358
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,600
You're forgiven. Leave now.

359
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,710
Come, Er Gou.

360
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,510
Don't ever eat food given by strangers.

361
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,490
Mr Zhou Chuan.

362
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,370
These are the meat buns I bought

363
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,170
from the hometown shop
you recommended online.

364
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,390
Mr Zhou Chuan.

365
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,780
Could we have a talk?

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,990
No need.

367
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,370
Er Gou and I have been on a diet.

368
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,040
We're not eating them.

369
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,970
Mr Zhou Chuan.

370
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,970
Is your hand all right?

371
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,850
It's okay.

372
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,780
Mr Zhou Chuan.

373
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,720
Could I have a minute of your time

374
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,920
to talk about your new novel
and the figure on the contract?

375
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
They're all negotiable.

376
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,610
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

377
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,650
Have a seat.

378
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,750
You're Mr Zhou Chuan?

379
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,250
And now you're calling me that.

380
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,230
Mr Zhou Chuan.

381
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,410
That was ignorant of me.

382
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,520
Mr Zhou Chuan, please pardon me.

383
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,980
Cut it out.

384
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,180
You have only two minutes.

385
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,130
I...

386
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,360
Sir.

387
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,390
It's bad for health to drink coffee
in the morning on an empty stomach.

388
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,380
Have some bun first.

389
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,610
Thanks.

390
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,690
But I'd like to remind you

391
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,980
that these buns don't worth as much as
the royalty of hundreds of thousands yuan.

392
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,490
Though the minimum number of
printed copies is forty thousand,

393
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,610
it's the highest figure
Yuan Yue Publishing House

394
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,890
has had from the past two years.

395
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,720
Our company is very sincere

396
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,910
to you. The sun and the moon
are the witnesses.

397
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,330
Then you go ask the sun and the moon

398
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,650
if I deserve to be
humiliated by these figures.

399
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,650
The sun and the moon are the witnesses?

400
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,400
What have I done to deserve this?

401
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,410
Mr Zhou Chuan.

402
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,540
We're not humiliating you.

403
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,570
I guarantee.

404
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,890
If you sign the contract with us,

405
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,330
I will definitely take care of
the publication of your book.

406
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,580
We can even make it two hundred thousand,

407
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,530
not to mention one hundred thousand.

408
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,350
That's an empty promise.

409
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,120
You could say whatever you want.

410
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,770
Time's up.

411
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,570
Thank you for your buns.

412
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,400
Though mine isn't some cheap coffee.

413
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,230
Mr Zhou Chuan.

414
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,590
If I remember correctly,

415
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,450
your Oriental Beauty

416
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,330
has had three printings.

417
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,360
Are you not confident

418
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,090
with Book of Luo He?

419
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,210
Are you trying to provoke me?

420
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,000
Of course I'm confident with my work.

421
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,670
Me too.

422
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,230
It's just that Yuan Yue Publishing House
doesn't deserve it.

423
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,970
In fact, you care not only

424
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,350
the minimum number of printed copies.

425
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,990
Otherwise, you'd have signed
the contract with Xin Dun Books.

426
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,810
Cut it out.

427
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,180
Please leave.

428
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,190
[Time Is Like A Song]

429
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,330
Yuan Yue Books is where Mr Zhou Gu Xuan

430
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,930
created his sales miracle.

431
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,730
Don't you want to surpass
your father in his battlefield

432
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,290
and become the new miracle?

433
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,890
I admit

434
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,630
that Yuan Yue Publishing House's
conditions are of average.

435
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,760
On the surface, you seem to be unwilling.

436
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,050
But you've listened to
the contract contents for times.

437
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,330
Actually, you're kind of

438
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,980
interested in working with
Yuan Yue Books, right?

439
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,710
You're a newbie, aren't you?

440
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,300
You're so full of yourself.

441
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,070
Yes, I'm a newbie.

442
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,890
Naturally, I'm no match for

443
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,330
those amazing editors.

444
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,530
And you might find
what I'm saying all empty talk.

445
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,440
But what I know is that,

446
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,750
if I don't manage to sign the contract
and publish your book,

447
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,570
there's no way I can stay at
the Yuan Yue Publishing House.

448
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,330
So, compared to those amazing editors,

449
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,080
I am more determined.

450
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,950
Please, Mr Zhou Chuan.

451
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,170

Are you done talking?

454
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,300

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm leaving.

462

Let me give you a hand.

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,450
Sure. Thank you.

464
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,170
Okay.

465
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,080
-Let me do it from here.
-Sure.

466
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,710
Here.

-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

468
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,080
Is this your bookstore?

469
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,760
Please come in if you want to buy books.

470
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,330
Can't I have a tour?

471
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,620
Well, help yourself.

472
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,450
Someone wants to buy the right
to The Disappearing Zoo.

473
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,940
Your bookstore is doing not bad.

474
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,280
Thank you. Please take a seat.

475
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,020
Let's get down to business.

476
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,130
The agreement says that

477
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,520
Xin Dun Books owns the right to
The Disappearing Series for ten years.

478
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,010
And now Mr Li Yu has eyes for
The Disappearing Zoo,

479
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,330
and wants to make it into a movie.

480
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,140
It's a very good opportunity.

481
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,650
What about you?

482
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,050
What's your role in it?

483
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,610
If you agree to sell the right,

484
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,650
I will have a meeting with the director,

485
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,580
the producers, and you.

486
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,220
The original author must join it.

487
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,860
That's the only request from the director.

488
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,900
Then no need.

489
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,380
I'm not selling the right.

490
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,470
Do you have to avoid me?

491
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,610
We're talking about Li Yu.

492
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,300
There are many authors
who want to work with him.

493
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm not avoiding you.

494
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,370
I just want to have
nothing to do with you.

495
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,280
You don't always come across
this kind of opportunity, Jiang Yu Cheng.

496
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,930
Do you want to hide here
running the bookstore forever?

497
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,550
Did I get Mr Zhou Chuan wrong?

498
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,970
How should I persuade him tomorrow?

561

You've known her for three years.

562
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,220
You fight all the time.
But you're never apart.

563
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,120
As if you're in a relationship.

564
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,180
We're not in a relationship.

565
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,760
We're purely netizens.

566
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,080
Yes.

567
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,590

568
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,760

playing with your phone.

You met the netizen today,
and it's a sad ending?

572
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,880
Not at all.

573
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,880
It's just that...

574
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,740

After all kinds of coincidences,

576
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,830
she's now my editor.

577
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,660
This morning, she came to
my place with the buns.

578
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,720
And then she asked me to sign
a publishing contract

579
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,940
that offers only forty thousand
printed copies and a royalty of 9%.

580
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,540
The thing is,

581
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:49,180
I drove her away in
a very malicious manner.

582
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,730
I drove her away.

583
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,160
She doesn't know you're Mr Fox anyway.

584
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
What are you panicking about?

585
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,280
Shouldn't I be panicking about it?

586
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,540
I drove her away without
even considering her feelings.

587
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,070
What if she finds out the truth

588
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,030
and write a book out of anger called

589
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,490
"Let's Talk About Sir Chuan
That You All Used to Love."

590
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,640
And it becomes the top-selling title on
every online bookstore and website.

591
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,900
Then I...

592
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,840
What are you laughing about?

593
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,940
What should I do now?

594
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,780
What are you saying? Just sign it.

595
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,540
Would you sign a contract that
offers forty thousand printed copies?

596
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,530
Let me be honest with you.

597
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,460
Considering the market situation,

598
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,670
that's a decent offer
from the publishing house.

599
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,100
As long as you can get it sold,

600
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,780
you will receive the royalty
and that from the second printing.

601
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,020
Also, aren't you negotiating about
the rights to the comic and game?

602
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,550
So what are you discontent about?

603
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,580
I'm discontent about
the amount of royalty.

604
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,270
It's not enough to pay for Er Gou's food.

605
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,380
Okay.

606
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,010
You do know what I want.

607
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,300
I do.

608
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,470
Someday, you're going to be
an author at the top of the pyramid.

609
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,700
And surpass your father.

610
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,770
All the more reason why you should
sign the contract with Yuan Yue Books.

611
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,960
Isn't that where he created the miracle?

612

Now is the beginning.

613
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,100
Why did you and her say the same thing?

614
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,860
Are you working in
collusion with each other?

615
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,770
We have never met before.
How can we be doing that?

616

into signing the contract?

662
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,090
Huh?

663
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,010
How many times have I told you?

664
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,920
Mr Nian Nian's next instalment

665
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,950
is about the reunion between
the male and female protagonists

666
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,410
after a long time apart.

667
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,310
Mr Nian Nian specifically asked you

668
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,920
to come up with illustrations
that are radiantly sorrowful.

669
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,830
Look at your work.

670
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,700
Tell me. What is this?

671
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,750
I only find it radiant.
Where's the sense of sorrow?

672
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,190
Deputy Editor Miao.

673
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,960
I gave it a thought.

674
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,740
I really have no idea
what radiantly sorrowful means.

675
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,810
So I...

676
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,110
Radiantly sorrowful...

677
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,550
Can you

678
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,070
figure out a solution first
when facing some difficulty?

679
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,990
Have the curls turned you into an idiot?

680
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,770
Stay still!

681
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,130
Tell me. What kind of attitude is this?

682
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,680
What kind of gesture is this, huh?

683
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,510
You're not happy because I scolded you.

684
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,750
-So you gave me middle finger.
-No.

685
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,390
You're giving your leader a middle finger.

686
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,800
She just tried to push her glasses up.

687
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,440
Right, Ah Xiang?

688
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,230
What pushing the glasses up?

689
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,970
Why did you come in so late?

690
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,600
I...

691
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,170
I went to Mr Zhou Chuan's place
this morning to sign the contract.

692
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,260
Have you signed it?

693
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,620
We're almost there.

694
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,510
When we're ready to sign the contract,

695
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,680
Mr Zhou Chuan couldn't find the seal.

696
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,840
But we can sign it
once he's found the seal.

697
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,520
Well, Chu Li,

698
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,880
I'm afraid the seal is lost forever.

699
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,090
He's rejected you.

700
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,820
Why do I feel that Mr Zhou Chuan
has lost the seal for real?

701
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,240
Miao.

702
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,010
Chu Li is a newbie.

703
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,430
You had the contract with you

704
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,150
for more than two weeks, but you
didn't get Mr Zhou Chuan sign it.

705
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,370
How can you expect her
to do so in a few days?

706
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,360
Chu Li, here's the thing.

707
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,350
You don't have to stay out of
the office for the whole morning.

708
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,700
You need to improve
your work efficiency. Got it?

709
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,950
Mr Zhou Chuan isn't the only author
under Yuan Yue Publishing House.

710
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,110
And that isn't your only task.

711
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,920
Got it, Chief Editor Yu.

712
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,390
I won't be late for work tomorrow.

713
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,550
Anyway, we need to pick up the pace.

714
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,730
The Marketing Department
people came today.

715
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,120
They said they need
the result by next week.

716
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,960

Your illustrations are
actually very interesting.

732
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,880
You purposely leave
the facial expressions out

748
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,730
And now she's

749

We're of the same mind.

761

Not to mention the seal,

762

Well, I just received the announcement.

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,090
An author is visiting us at 2 p.m.

793
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,150
One of you will go tidy up the library.

Chu Li shall see to it, then.

You see, each of us has to
do our own work.

796

And Xiao Niao needs to finish up

Have you reached Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

800
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,740
Mr Jiang said that, before the meeting,

801
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,480
he'd like to know more about
our opinions about his novels.

802
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,480
Though he asked for a simple document,

803
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,610
I want to make him a detailed
PowerPoint presentation.

Indeed.

more than five times.

816

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,130
how can you communicate with Mr Jiang

823
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,100
without understanding the contents?

824
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,190
Don't you worry.

825
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,280
I'll memorise all the contents.

826
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,950
Xiao Niao.

827
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,950
Did you find Mr Jiang's Jiangnan Circuit

828
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,280
a good read?

829
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,260
I read it when I was in high school.

830
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,010
But it's been a long time.
I don't remember it well.

831
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,590
Jiangnan Circuit is Mr Kou Wei's work.

832
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,210
Xiao Niao.

833
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,980
It's not that I'm not willing to help you.

834
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,430
But since Miao asked
you to contact Mr Jiang,

835
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,260
it's your job to understand his works.

836
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,160
That's the way to
show respect for the author.

837
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,020
I'm really sorry.

838
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,780
I can't help you with it.

839
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:20,840
[Little Monkey]

840
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,100
[Mr Zhou Chuan.]

841
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,540
[Can I come to your place this afternoon?]

842
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,880
Fine. You just want to
see me for the seal, don't you?

843
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,920
[Chu Li]
[Zhou Chuan]

844
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,540
[The seal. Come here at once.]
