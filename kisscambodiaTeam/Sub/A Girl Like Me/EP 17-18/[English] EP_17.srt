<i>Episode 17</i>

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,280
Engagement?

37
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,790
Yes. Count Cheng’an said so.

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,310
I dare not ask more.

39
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,360
By the way, Your Grace,

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,150
do you remember

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,680
the servant by Count Rong’s side

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,030
in Rong’s mansion

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,870
back then?

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,470
The one

45
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,590
who was glib and loyal.

46
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,800
Yes, I do.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
Why do you bring him up?

48
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,240
Today in Count Cheng’an’s mansion,

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,470
an old butler

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,360
looked exactly like that servant.

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,910
Strangely,

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,560
he didn’t seem to recognize me at all.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,800
Is that so?

54
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,400
Perhaps we are old.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,000
He didn’t remember your look.

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,680
These two are the best in our shop,

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,840
but you are still not satisfied.

58
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,630
Though I like them,

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,960
I don’t know which one I should buy.

60
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,750
Certainly, this one is good.

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,280
As the saying goes,

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,710
you get what you pay for.

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
I’m telling you a secret.

64
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,360
This is a limited edition.

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,360
Limited edition?

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,870
Exactly.

67
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,630
I’ll take this one!

68
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,190
Sure.

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,590
Your taste is bad, isn’t it?

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,680
Last time, we fancied the same one.

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,190
Since my taste is bad,

72
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,710
you are no better than me.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,190
Things have changed.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,150
Moreover,
you guessed it right last time.

75
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,310
I know nothing about it.

76
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,310
You can boast as you please.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,750
Boast?

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,630
Sir, tell her. Do I know these things?

79
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,240
Of course you know.

80
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,710
You are an expert.

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
In that case,

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,590
sir, did you lie to me just now?

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
That’s not true.

84
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,470
Well... They have their own merits.

85
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,840
They have their own merits.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,630
Look.

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
The gloss of this plate

88
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,510
is not so bright as that one,

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,120
but it’s more natural, isn’t it?

90
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,390
Moreover, take a close look.

91
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,040
Isn’t this one more translucent?

92
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,040
It must be the superb glass

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,920
imported from foreign countries.

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,390
The boss is unaware of its rarity,

95
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
so he priced it wrongly.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Really?

97
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,870
Why bother lying to you?

98
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,800
I’ll take it if you don’t.

99
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,160
Sir, I’ll take this set.

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes, miss.

101
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,800
Have a check.

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,070
If it’s fine,

103
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,680
I’ll deliver it to your mansion.

104
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,630
Have a check?

105
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,360
Easy peasy. Four words.

106
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,480
Look. Listen. Compare. Touch.

107
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,390
First, look.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,070
Look at its appearance carefully.

109
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,310
The shape. Gloss. Pattern.

110
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,800
If there are any visible defects.

111
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,630
Second, listen.

112
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,750
Knock it.

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,000
Is the sound good?

114
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,190
It sounds good.

115
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,000
That means it’s a good plate.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Next, compare.

117
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
You two are so intimate.

118
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,120
Are you picking dowries?

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,190
We are picking dowries,

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,750
but I will not marry him.

121
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,270
Nor will I marry her.

122
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,800
What do you mean by that?

123
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,430
Am I not good enough for you?

124
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,630
So what if you are?

125
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,560
Will you marry me?

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,270
You...

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,830
You rogue!

128
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,830
Shameless!

129
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,310
Why did I have such a dream?

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Count Cheng’an!

131
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,680
Will he get in danger?

132
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,160
Your Grace.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Why do you look so pale?

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,830
Do you feel unwell?

135
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,920
Let me take you there and have a rest.

136
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,240
I’m fine.

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,040
I’m gonna supervise Ban Heng’s training,

138
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,390
lest he’ll slack off again and run away.

139
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,510
No worries, Your Grace.

140
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,430
I will not allow him to run away.

141
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,950
Your Grace! Your Grace!

142
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,190
Your Grace!

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,120
Your Grace! Bad news!

144
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,680
Something happened
in Count Cheng’an’s Mansion!

145
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,870
What happened there?

146
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,000
It seems someone died there!

147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,870
Someone died?

148
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,240
Your Grace!

149
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,830
Young Master.

150
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,720
Where is my sister going?

151
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,360
Someone died in Cheng’an’s Mansion.

152
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,560
Someone died...!

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,070
No!

154
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,190
If Count Cheng’an is really dead,

155
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,510
my sister will be known

156
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,560
for predestined widowhood!

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,950
It’s my fault.

158
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,870
It’s my fault.

159
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,360
I should’ve reminded you of this.

160
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
Who is your murderer?

161
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,560
I swear I’ll avenge your death.

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,510
Your Grace.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,630
Tell me.

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Who on earth killed him?

165
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
Yesterday, Butler Rong was impacted

166
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,310
by an uncontrollable carriage.

167
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,950
He had died before the physician came.

168
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,390
Hua.

169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,390
I...

170
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,120
Come with me.

171
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,150
Hua.

172
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,150
What’s on your mind?

173
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,440
Why don’t you talk to me?

174
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,360
We are done from now on.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
If you don’t love me,

176
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,910
why do you come here?

177
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,240
If you don’t worry about me,

178
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,960
why are you shedding tears?

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,120
I...

180
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,510
You wished us

181
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,630
to be frank to each other,

182
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,480
didn’t you?

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,720
But now,

184
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,670
why don’t you be frank and tell me?

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
I dreamed my family was confiscated.

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,870
I don’t want you dead.

187
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,480
Dream?

188
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,360
Yes.

189
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,840
I’ve been having these weird dreams,

190
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,150
the break-off of my engagement,

191
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,030
the blindness of Xie Qilin,

192
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,120
and the death of my grandmother.

193
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,390
I dreamed all of these things.

194
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,360
More terribly,

195
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,390
all these dreams have come true.

196
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,910
So,

197
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,720
you dreamed I got killed.

198
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,150
That’s why you come here?

199
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
You deliberately refused me,

200
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,240
for you feared I’d get implicated?

201
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,390
I’ve been all alone.

202
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
Not until I met you,

203
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,270
did I know there’d be
another way to live.

204
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,630
Hua, as long as I can be with you,

205
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,440
I don’t fear death.

206
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,390
If my family really falls...

207
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,360
You have me.

208
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,390
I won’t let that happen.

209
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,240
Hua.

210
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,870
Rest assured.

211
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
From now on,

212
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
I’ll guard you all the time,

213
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
and the whole Ban family.

214
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,120
Because you all are my family.

215
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,870
I will never allow any harm
to my family.

216
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Thank you.

217
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,670
Hua. Hua.

218
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,550
Go get a physician!

219
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,750
Hua.

220
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,630
Hua.

221
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,750
Hua, you woke up.

222
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,150
The physician said you were weak
due to anxiety.

223
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,600
And you had a cold.

224
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,910
You need some medicine and a good rest.

225
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,030
I’m going home.

226
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,030
Okay, take the medicine

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,440
and I’ll send you home.

228
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,480
No bother.

229
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,750
Be good and take the medicine.

230
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,270
Why are you laughing?

231
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,080
I know you wanna stay with me.

232
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,750
What do you mean?

233
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,200
If you don’t,

234
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,320
why do you refuse to take the medicine?

235
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,550
You don’t wanna recover too soon,

236
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,960
so you can stay longer with me.

237
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,150
You bookworm.

238
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,790
You’re good at coaxing.

239
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,550
Have you arranged Butler Rong’s funeral?

240
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,790
Yes, as you required, Young Master.

241
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,720
But I suspected

242
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,790
there’s something fishy about his death.

243
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,200
Investigate and figure out the truth.

244
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,630
Report to me any time.

245
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,550
Yes.

246
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,390
Well...

247
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,000
How is Her Grace now?

248
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,960
She’s fine.

249
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,270
She just needs some more rest.

250
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,000
Should I prepare
some chicken soup for her?

251
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,480
Darling.

252
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,200
Count Cheng’an is supposed to
come and propose.

253
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,270
When he comes,

254
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,360
what betrothal presents
should I ask from him?

255
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,630
The matchmaker hasn’t come yet.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Now are you thinking about the dowry?

257
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,510
I can’t marry my daughter to him
for nothing.

258
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,440
Since Hua was born,

259
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,440
I’ve been thinking to be father-in-law

260
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
and put on airs.

261
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
Now my dream is about to come true!

262
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,200
The dowry should be
the first consideration.

263
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,440
Besides what we’ve prepared for Hua,

264
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,390
we need four chefs,

265
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,910
and eight or ten embroiderers

266
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,030
from the south.

267
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,150
Eight or ten?

268
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,200
To match with Hua,

269
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
we should make more outfits for him.

270
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,030
Hua gets used to her own bed.

271
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
A new bed should be customized

272
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,360
and delivered to her.

273
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,960
So many things?

274
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,480
We can have him marry into our family,

275
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,670
lest we move all the things there.

276
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,670
That’s a good idea.

277
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,390
Yeah.

278
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,840
Hua doesn’t have to leave home!

279
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,550
Right!

280
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,000
The thing is that,

281
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,600
will she be reluctant to marry

282
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,750
for fear of implicating him?

283
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,270
You brat.

284
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,550
Dreams aren’t necessarily true.

285
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,390
She dreamed our family was confiscated.

286
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,960
Now we got promoted.

287
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
She’s a Princess.

288
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,870
I’m the Prime Minister.

289
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,200
Father. Mother.

290
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,910
Hua, you are back.

291
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,000
Hua.

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,510
You look radiant.

293
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,630
Count Cheng’an
has taken good care of you.

294
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,870
It’s my honor to care for Hua.

295
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,670
Rocky. Take Ban Hua back to her room.

296
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,240
Yes.

297
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,030
Why should I go back?

298
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,600
Your Grace.

299
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,720
-I’ve learnt new massage skills.
-Go back.

300
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,240
I can help you cure the cold.

301
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
Yes, go back for a rest.

302
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,960
Greetings. Mr. Ban. Mrs. Ban.

303
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,480
Today I come to see you

304
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,120
for the promise I made
to Princess Royal.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
Please allow me

306
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
to marry Ban Hua.

307
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,880
Count Cheng’an.

308
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,480
You and I are on good terms,

309
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,000
but it concerns my daughter’s happiness

310
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,830
in the future.

311
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,240
I need to discuss it with my wife.

312
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,920
Right?

313
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,960
Father. You didn’t say so just now.

314
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,880
No one sees you as dumb.

315
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,590
If I can have your approval,

316
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,680
I promise I’ll love her all my life,

317
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,790
and never betray her.

318
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,400
If I break my word,

319
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,830
I shall have a miserable
and lonely life,

320
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,440
and my fame shall be ruined.

321
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,310
You bet so big?

322
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,680
Count Cheng’an.

323
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,640
Ban Hua doesn’t love books.

324
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,400
You two share no hobby.

325
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,790
Once married,

326
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,270
you’ll be together for decades.

327
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,510
Have you made up your mind?

328
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,830
Rest assured, Mrs. Ban.

329
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
She is no ordinary girl.

330
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,960
I won’t treat her

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
in an ordinary way.

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,070
As for what she likes,

333
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,830
I’ll learn to appreciate and understand.

334
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,720
As for what she doesn’t like,

335
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
I’ll never push her.

336
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,000
Some decades

337
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,510
is far too short for us.

338
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,480
If there’d be afterlife,

339
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,680
I’d still marry her as my wife.

340
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,720
You make me want to marry you.

341
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Darling, so your decision is...

342
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,750
My wife and I...

343
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
have agreed.

344
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,550
As for Ban Hua,

345
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,920
it depends on you.

346
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
Thanks for your kindness.

347
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,440
Count Cheng’an.

348
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,920
My sister is a handful.

349
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,030
You may pay more attention to her.

350
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Go to see her.

351
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,510
Have a good talk with her.

352
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,960
Go ahead. Have a good talk.

353
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,440
Sure.

354
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,480
Du Jiu.

355
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,480
Do you think it will work?

356
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,070
Sir, you prepared it wholeheartedly.

357
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,070
I believe

358
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,510
Her Grace will not turn you down.

359
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
What if she says no?

360
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,030
Then we can try other ways.

It’s wonderful.

Your Grace, what is it for

370
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,960
to invite me here
for your zither playing?

371
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Your Grace. Are you all right?

372
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,070
Why is your face flushing red?

373
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,640
Do you get infected by me
and have a cold?

374
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,550
I’m fine, Hua.

375
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,310
It’s too hot in the room, maybe.

376
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,480
Let’s get some air on the balcony.

377
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,110
You picked a good room.

378
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,070
Look.

379
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,240
From the balcony,

380
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,480
the best night view here can be seen.

381
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,680
Hua.

382
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,350
Today, I actually...

383
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,270
I asked you here...

384
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,480
To tell you...

385
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
That...

386
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,790
We may...

387
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,200
We may get...

388
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,750
Have you got it?

389
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,680
Your Grace.

390
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,640
What are you talking about?

391
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,350
Hua.

392
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,270
Marry me.

393
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,830
What are you doing?

394
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,400
Young Master. What brings you here?

395
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,160
It’s a big moment for my sister.

396
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,110
How can I miss it?

397
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
But,

398
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,510
I haven’t had enough

399
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,350
of being single.

400
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,160
As long as you agree to marry me,

401
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,510
the wedding day is up to you.

402
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,480
What if I wanna be single all my life?

403
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,000
Well,

404
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,550
can you allow me

405
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,110
to be by your side all my life?

406
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,440
It’ll be too hard for you, won’t it?

407
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,440
Certainly not.

408
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,030
Being with you,

409
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,400
I can’t be happier.

410
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,550
How could it be hard?

411
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,480
Then could you tell me

412
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,350
since when did you fall for me?

413
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,030
I’m quite curious.

414
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,000
I...

415
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,590
You can’t even answer this,
and you want to marry me?

416
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
You mistook me.

417
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,440
I think,

418
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
I fell for you

419
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
at the autumn hunting.

420
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,680
When you took advantage of me
in the bush?

421
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,590
No.

422
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,110
I mean the time

423
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,510
when I got drunk

424
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,000
and shot the arrow with you.

425
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,680
Then it came to me that

426
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,720
it should be the skating.

427
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,590
I’ve been into you unknowingly.

428
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,790
So, you’ve been into me

429
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,830
since then.

430
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,350
That explains.

431
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,960
You helped my family over and over.

432
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,480
Yes.

433
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,960
Then I get along well with your parents,

434
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,830
and your brother.

435
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,680
From them, I feel the long-gone warmth.

436
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,270
I got to know

437
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,400
you are the one of my life.

438
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,880
Count Cheng’an

439
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,920
looks shy and gentle,

440
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,350
yet he’s so good at love words.

441
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,270
Scholars are indeed different.

442
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah.

443
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,640
I suppose

444
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,590
my sister has got his virgin

445
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,400
when she was in his mansion.

446
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
No. No. No.

447
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,830
Let me ask you, Your Grace.

448
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,270
If my family

449
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,640
gets in great disaster,

450
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,720
what will you do?

451
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,640
I will definitely stand out

452
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,030
and guard your family.

453
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,920
If I die accidentally,

454
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,310
what will you do?

455
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,200
I’ll protect all your families,

456
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,310
and keep you in my mind
for the time to come.

457
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,830
Count Cheng’an.

458
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
You are really silly.

459
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,110
Why do you say so, Hua?

460
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,680
If you die,

461
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,590
I’ll definitely remarry.

462
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,790
For the sake that

463
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,880
you’re simple-minded,

464
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,030
I may agree to marry you.

465
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
What’s wrong with you?

466
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
I’ve agreed, haven’t I?

467
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,680
Great! Hua.

468
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
I thought you’d turn me down.

469
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,720
I could barely breathe.

470
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,160
You are sincere to me.

471
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,880
How can I turn you down?

472
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
You scholars are so silly.

473
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,270
Du Jiu.

474
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,030
Get me the love knots.

475
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,200
On my way, Young Master.

476
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

477
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,200
Cheng.

478
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,750
We’re here to back you up.

479
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,640

until death do us apart.

490
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,830
No worries, Your Grace.

502
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,790
Thanks to Your Majesty’s blessing.

503
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,550
That’s great.

504
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,160
The Ban family acts wild,

505
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,200
but they do show respect to me

506
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,590
when it comes to my request.

507
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,440
Thanks to Your Majesty’s efforts.

508
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,240
Prime Minister said
if it weren’t for your matchmaking,

509
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,790
they wouldn’t even allow me
to go to their mansion.

510
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,680
Don’t take it to heart.

511
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,030
My cousin is

512
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,440
just stubborn.

513
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,960
My kindness to them has paid off.

514
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,310
Finally,
what I promised my aunt is fulfilled.

515
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,110
By the way,

516
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,350
have you got any clue

517
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,550
about Princess Royal’s murderer?

518
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,640
Your Majesty.

519
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,200
I’ve ordered
to investigate it separately.

520
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,070
No exact information for now.

521
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,160
Prime Minister Ban will be your family.

522
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,480
You must get it to the bottom

523
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,310
and uphold justice for them.

524
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,480
I’ll thoroughly investigate it

525
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,920
and find out the murderer
as soon as possible.

526
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,830
Young Master.

527
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,640
Why can you never parry this strike?

528
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,550
I bear no grudge with you.

529
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,200
Why trying to kill me with every blow?

530
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,270
You even strike harder.

531
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,350
That’s the way of sword training.

532
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,750
If you don’t try all out,

533
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,160
how can you do better?

534
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
That doesn’t make sense.

535
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,680
Come. Let’s sit down and talk.

536
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,920
Are you sitting?

537
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,110
Do you have guts to slack off?

538
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,830
Hua.

539
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,480
We haven’t talked for long.

540
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,350
Let’s have a word or two.

541
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Then continue the training.

542
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
A word or two?

543
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,880
First word.

544
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,440
I think

545
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,830
you agreed to marry him too soon.

546
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
You want me to marry him

547
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
all the time, don’t you?

548
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes, that’s true.

549
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,310
But you should make the process harder.

550
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,510
The harder you make it,
the more he loves you.

551
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,110
Isn’t it hard enough?

552
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,550
Never enough.

553
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,350
I’m a man.

554
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,550
I know what men are thinking.

555
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,110
Too late. I’ve agreed.

556
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,550
I think another man

557
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,030
is needed to meddle in it.

558
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,590
Shi Jin is a good choice.

559
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,310
He’s been admiring you.

560
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,550
No.

561
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,310
He could be the man in black.
We must be on guard.

562
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,270
How so?

563
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,200
I can’t talk with you.

564
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,480
Softy.

565
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,790
Continue.

566
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,750
Yes.

567
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,480
Listen, make it harder day by day.

568
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,790
No worries, Your Grace.

569
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
I’ll never forget this.

570
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,200
Softy.

571
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,400
No wonder

572
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
I can’t parry the last strike of yours.

573
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,110
You make the blow harder and harder?

574
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,310
Of course. Or how can you do better?

575
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,200
I’m going to Count Cheng’an.

576
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,550
Hua. Have some more talk with me.

577
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,960
Have some more...

578
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,350
Young Master, shall we?

579
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,350
<i>Noodles</i>

580
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,680
<i>Noodles</i>
Hua, this is the restaurant.

581
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,350
<i>Noodles</i>

582
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,110
<i>Noodles</i>
Is this the West Noodles Restaurant?

583
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,830
<i>Noodles</i>

584
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,830
<i>Noodles</i>
Do you think it’s too average?

585
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,880
No.

586
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,510
It’s said that

587
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,200
their noodles are very tasty,

588
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,720
usually sold out before noon.

589
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,550
Have you come here before?

590
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,110
I passed by, but didn’t try it.

591
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,720
Sir, two bowls of plain noodles.

592
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,480
Sure.

593
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,000
The noodles are simple but so delicious.

594
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,270
He didn’t lie to me.

595
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,350
Who?

596
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,750
Softy.

597
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
She told me that

598
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,880
the noodles here were very delicious.

599
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,510
Back then,

600
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,550
I didn’t really have a chance

601
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,830
to dine in such a noodles restaurant.

602
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,680
If I knew it earlier,

603
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,550
I’d be a regular here.

604
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,820
<i>Noodles</i>

605
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,160
<i>Noodles</i>
Any other delicacies here?

606
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,270
Yes, vegetarian dumplings.

607
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,550
Wait for me.

608
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
How come you are here, Your Grace?

609
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,480
Lord Shi.

610
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,110
Are you here for noodles?

611
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Seems I’m too late

612
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,270
to honor my promise.

613
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,750
The noodles are really tasty.

614
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,240
Lord Shi.

615
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,720
Your Grace.

616
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,000
Hua. Dumplings are ordered,

617
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,830
and will be served soon.

618
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,680
You called her name, Your Grace.

619
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Isn’t it too rude...?

620
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,110
You mistake it, Shi.

621
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,440
I asked him to call my name.

622
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,880
You don’t know it, Shi.

623
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,680
I’ve engaged with her.

624
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,350
What’s wrong with the address?

625
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,760
Is it true, Your Grace?

626
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,440
Yes, Lord Shi.

627
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,360
I’ve agreed to marry him.

628
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,510
Sir, pack up the dumplings for me.

629
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,480
Yes, sir.

630
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,710
Your Grace.

631
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,840
Lord Shi. It’s going to rain.

632
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,920
Hurry and go for a shelter
from the rain.

633
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:51,540
<i>Noodles</i>

634
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,550
Shi.

635
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,480
How did you get drenched?

636
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,110
Go get changed.

637
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,280
Feixian.

638
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,590
Count Cheng’an is
no longer your concern.

639
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,030
Shi Jin. Could it be...

640
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,110
You’ve known the woman he will marry?

641
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Ask no more about it.

642
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,800
How can I not ask?

643
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,480
He’ll marry another woman.

644
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,880
My heart hurts like being stabbed.

645
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,110
Who is the woman?

646
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,630
How did she

647
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,190
force him to marry her?

648
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,670
Why do you think

649
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,000
she forced him to marry her?

650
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,070
What if Count Cheng’an really loves her?

651
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,550
What else would you say?

652
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,190
But in the whole capital,

653
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,230
only I deserve to marry him.

654
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,710
Shi Jin. Tell me the truth,

655
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,280
so that I can give up.

656
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,320
Give up

657
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,150
or you’ll retaliate?

658
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,960
You’ve underestimated me.

659
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,110
I’ll take back what I want

660
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,070
with my own hands.

661
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,480
People in Daye will know

662
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,030
I am

663
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,960
the only perfect match for him.

664
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,760
Miss Shi.

665
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,400
Greetings, Miss Shi.

666
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,320
Miss Shi.

667
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,960
Greetings.

668
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,550
Miss Shi.

669
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,880
Miss Shi.

670
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,190
Who do you think

671
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,550
is the fiancée of Count Cheng’an?

672
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,110
Shouldn’t it be Miss Feixian?

673
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,030
I’ve asked all the nobles
in the capital,

674
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,110
but no one knows it.

675
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,110
It’s weird. Isn’t she of noble blood?

676
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,190
Don’t make wild guess.

677
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,000
When Count Cheng’an comes,

678
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,440
we can ask him about it.

679
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,110
What will you ask him?

680
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,800
Your Grace?

681
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,190
If I remember it correctly,

682
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,630
Your Grace isn’t invited
for this poetry party.

683
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,710
Are Your Grace interested in poems?

684
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,550
I’m not interested.

685
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,480
Count Cheng’an insisted,

686
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,510
so I come here.

687
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,920
Thanks for your invitation, Miss Shi.

688
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,360
I come with my fiancée
without prior notice.

689
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,880
Please pardon me, ladies.
