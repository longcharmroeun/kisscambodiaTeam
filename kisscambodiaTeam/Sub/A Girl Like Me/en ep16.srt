1
00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:02,039
So you're saying you ran out

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:03,119
when the power went down just now.

3
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:04,239
Yes. That's right. It was me.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,239
So why did you run
when the security guards called you?

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,119
Mr. Xu.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,920
If you hadn't asked about it,

7
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:13,359
I would've never told you.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,560
I've been keeping this to myself
for a long time now.

9
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:17,200
From the first day they saw me,

10
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,760
those two security guards

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,200
were after my beautiful look

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,879
and body.

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,200
One time,
they even pushed me to the ground.

14
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,043
Lei Na saw it too,
but she didn't do anything.

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,159
So I could only run when I saw them.

16
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,399
Mr. Xu, if you are a fair man,

17
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,479
you should fire them immediately.

18
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,920
But if you want to cover for them,

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,479
it's all right. I can bear with it.

20
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,599
But I can only do nothing
but run when I see them.

21
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,560
Mr. Xu, I found the helmet.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,560
The helmet.

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,240
Rest well.

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,519
Why do the three of you look

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,279
as if you just got away with something?

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,440
=Love Crossed=

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,580
=Episode 16=

28
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,679
-Mr. Xu!
-Mr. Xu!

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,280
Someone ran out earlier, right?

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes!

31
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,280
We chased after that person
for a long way!

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
Especially me.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,480
I hurt my arm too.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,159
Mr. Xu, would this count
as a workplace injury?

35
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,920
It would be great
if we could get a raise.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
Trying to get a raise, right?

37
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,560
Both of you...

38
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,760
You couldn't keep them in. You couldn't
catch the person who sneaked out.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
And you even had the wrong person.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,280
What did you do right?

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
All I see are mistakes.

42
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,079
Actually, Mr. Xu...

43
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,400
We're fine without a raise.

44
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
We're strong and healthy, you see.

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,959
That's right, Mr. Xu.

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,159
My arm is just fine.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,217
I'll just put a band-aid on it.

48
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,360
Away with the both of you!

49
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,400
Yes, sir!

50
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,400
Mr. Xu,

51
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,799
why didn't you fire them?

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,959
We can't let more people

53
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,679
know about the Bay House.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,760
Besides, you're one I'd like to fire
more than them.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,799
Well, the helmet

56
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,840
was a moment of carelessness.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,079
But I noticed something
even more important!

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
Lu Xiao and Jiang Kele

59
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,425
were wearing couple outfits earlier,
did you see that?

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Say, don't you think

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,240
it's thanks to my quick-thinking

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,960
and my super speedy motorbike

63
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,439
that we got out of this?

64
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm telling you,

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
if we got caught, we'd be done for.

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,960
You don't know how scary it was.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,240
Last time,

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
when I was caught by Lei Na,

69
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,559
they almost injected me with poison.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,319
But thankfully,

71
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,960
she didn't know how to use it,
so it all went to waste.

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,040
I know.

73
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,040
You do?

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,599
Did they try to inject you too?

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,319
No, they didn't.

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,960
But I was interrogated in the pool once.

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,920
Oh, I got it now.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,279
You sneaked out last time

79
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,760
to see your mother too, didn't you?

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Then along the way, you kissed me.

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,399
They found out, and you were caught
and taken back here.

82
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,920
So that means I saved you twice.

83
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,439
Twice!

84
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,319
Thank you.

85
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,119
What was that?

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,240
Thank you.

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,999
I can't hear you.

88
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:30,920
Never mind then.

89
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,040
Thank you.

90
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,360
See.

91
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,879
Wouldn't it be great
if you had just been honest?

92
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,439
If you had been honest with me sooner,

93
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,399
I could have taken you out
through the tunnel.

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,960
You could go to any places

95
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,480
whenever you wanted.

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,559
Well, who would have known
that there was a secret tunnel?

97
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm sure even Xu Guanghan himself
doesn't know about it.

98
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,319
That's true.

99
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,879
You've been staying here all the time.

100
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
Of course you wouldn't know about it.

101
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,319
But that's all right.

102
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,640
You have me now.

103
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,119
I'll arrange

104
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,439
our future escapades.

105
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,800
I was just "almost" caught today.

106
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,920
Do you have
to look down on me like that?

107
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,640
No, I'm not.

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,559
I just want to make
a pinky promise with you.

109
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,620
(Crush On Love)

110
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,279
When will we be able to meet again?

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,159
Will you come to find me
at the Bay House again?

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,119
If you want to see me, come outside.

113
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,760
Then... I'll see you tomorrow night.

114
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,559
What are you doing here late at night
with the lights off?

115
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,240
Did you think the power went out again?

116
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,800
Here. I'm giving this back to you.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
Thank you for today.

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,279
You're welcome.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,640
You went out because you had
something important to do,

120
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:42,760
right?

121
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:44,599
So you've sneaked out of this place too?

122
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
You know about that tunnel too?

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
When did you find out about it?

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,279
Recently.

125
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,279
Did Jiang Kele tell you about it?

126
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,960
Why did she tell you about it first
and not me?

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,159
Because I had something important to do.

128
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,119
That's why I went out.

129
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:07,879
But don't worry.

130
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,119
She and I are just friends.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,960
I trust you.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,480
As for that tunnel...

133
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,360
A secret between us.

134
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,760
Where did you get this motorbike?

135
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,399
I just bought it.

136
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,920
You're home late. Where did you go?

137
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,159
On a ride!

138
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:41,319
What about you?

139
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,240
I... I...

140
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,599
I worked overtime.

141
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,719
Okay, I can't hold it in anymore.
I'll talk first.

142
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,040
I made up with Lu Xiao.

143
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
He promised me that he would go with me

144
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,959
to see his mother.

145
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,279
Then I won't hide this from you either.

146
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,519
Xu Nian and I made a promise.

147
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,040
We'll go on dates in the outside world.

148
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,159
I want to show him
the outside world before having him

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
make the decision.

150
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,680
But he never came.

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, I know what happened.

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,199
What happened?

153
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,159
Here,

154
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,199
why don't we find a place
to get a drink and talk?

155
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll get the car.

156
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,199
Wait.

157
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,959
Come with me on my motorbike.
We'll take a ride.

158
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,320
Your new motorbike?

159
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,120
Brand new!

160
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,680
Let's go.

161
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,159
Morning, Kele.

162
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,680
Morning.

163
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,599
Here for work, eh?

164
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,519
Don't talk to me!

165
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,240
What's gotten into you today?

166
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,360
You seem unfriendly towards us.

167
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,920
Don't both of you know?

168
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,040
Why did you chase after me
when I went out to buy candles

169
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,000
last night?

170
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh, that.

171
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,599
Mr. Xu already gave us a scolding.

172
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,240
I promise I won't mistake you
for someone else again.

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Before this, I thought both of you

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,719
might have bad eyesight too.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,920
But now?

176
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,560
I can't tell if that's the case

177
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,560
or if you guys are after my beauty.

178
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,680
No, no, of course not!

179
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,719
Absolutely not!

180
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,120
I swear. Both of us

181
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,079
do not have any sort of
intentions towards you.

182
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,399
Right. I swear to the heavens!

183
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,199
Never mind.
I wouldn't know even if you broke it.

184
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,120
Only the heavens would know.

185
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,920
Anyway,

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
I've reported the damages you caused me

187
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,120
to Mr. Xu.

188
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
You'd better

189
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
watch how you treat me from now on.

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,240
Please come in, Ms. Jiang!

191
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,079
What was that?

192
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,959
Sorry!

193
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,120
Why didn't you knock?

194
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,639
I... I thought you would get
used to it by now.

195
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,560
Well, I'd still like some privacy.

196
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,279
Sorry. My bad.

197
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,959
I came to tell you

198
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,360
that we'll make our move tonight.

199
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,759
One, two,

200
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
Two, two.

202
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,079
Seven, eight.

203
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:45,920
Stop.

204
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,159
Luo Ke,

205
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,159
why is your body so stiff today?

206
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,320
Su Lie, help him stretch his body.

207
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,880
Stretch? That's painful!

208
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
I don't want to do it!

209
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,279
What is it? Tell me.

210
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,000
I have something important
to do tonight.

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,040
I have to go out.

212
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,040
If anything happens,

213
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,399
cover for me.

214
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,440
Okay. I'll go out after you come back.

215
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,959
Cover for me then.

216
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,360
Okay. No problem.

217
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,440
Change.

218
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh my god.

219
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,399
Hurry. Hurry.

220
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:36,959
Hang on.

221
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,240
Pass it over.

222
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
Why are you so slow today?

223
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,719
Must be because of the stretch earlier.

224
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
I haven't recovered from it yet.

225
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,240
Maybe you'll feel better
after playing a few rounds.

226
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,079
Get the food out. Faster.

227
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,159
I'm already doing that.

228
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,759
Hang on, hang on.

229
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
The plate is over there.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,839
Oh, just cut the vegetables.

231
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,159
They've been playing for over an hour

232
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,120
and they're still playing it.

233
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,480
I can't stand it any longer.

234
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm going to get them
back to their rooms right now.

235
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,719
No, you can't be violent.

236
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,719
But they...

237
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,880
Leave it to me.

238
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:20,759
Hurry, hurry.

239
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,880
It's counting down.

240
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,560
Get the plate over here.

241
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,719
Hurry up.

242
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,120
Xu Nian, what are you doing?

243
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,279
We were just about
to complete that level.

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,040
Playing games, huh?
Have you learned the dance?

245
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,920
We practiced together
this afternoon, didn't we?

246
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
Right. We stretched together too.

247
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,599
There are still a few moves

248
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,279
you guys haven't perfected yet.

249
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,240
-I...
-That's enough.

250
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,639
Come with me. We're going to practice.

251
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,159
Hurry up.

252
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,920
Come on.

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,079
Let's go.

254
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,120
Do you want to give it a try?

255
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,800

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,320
Su Lie, why did you stop?

271
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
I still think it's weird
that it's just the three of us here.

272
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,240
He's right. Why isn't Lu Xiao here
getting his moves checked too?

273
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,759
Do you want to check his moves?

274
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,079
Go and get him then.

275
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,599
Su Lie, why don't you go?

276
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,480
I think you should go, Luo Ke.

277
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,719
I think it's better that you go.

278
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,120
I think

279
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,599
we're good with just the three of us.

280
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,599
Right.

281
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,719
Su Lie, count the beats.

282
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,719
Five, six, seven, eight.

283
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

284
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Over here, Lu Xiao.

285
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,639
Can I help you?

286
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,959
We're here to visit a patient.

287
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,599
Name?

288
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,399
I'm Jiang Kele.

289
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Not your name.

290
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
I'm Li Zhenyu.

291
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,120
I meant the name of the patient.

292
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,199
Jiang Wenyue.

293
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,599
Jiang Wenyue.

294
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,759
She's in the ICU.

295
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,959
How is her condition?

296
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,199
Not well.

297
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:21,880
She was resuscitated again this morning.

298
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,440
I don't think she can hold on
for much longer.

299
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,040
Where is the ICU? I want to visit her.

300
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,159
It is past the visiting hours.

301
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,320
Come again tomorrow.

302
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
No, I mean...
She doesn't have much time left

303
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,000
and you won't let him see her?

304
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,880
Then why are you wasting our time
with all those questions?

305
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,159
If I hadn't wasted your time,

306
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,040
how would I have known that
you were here to visit an ICU patient?

307
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
I went through
a lot of difficulties just to get here.

309
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
Could you please let me see her?

310
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,719
Just one glance.

311
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,800
Not even a single glance.

312
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,320
Do you have any sense of compassion?

313
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,079
I'm telling you,

314
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,240
if you're the reason

315
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,079
that a son couldn't even

316
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,040
see his mother in her final moments,

317
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,320
I'll have you pay for it!

318
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,800
The rules are put in place
for ICU patients

319
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,560
for the sake of their welfare.

320
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,880
You are only allowed
to visit for two hours each day.

321
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,159
From 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.

322
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,240
It's way past that time now.

323
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,399
The patient needs to get rest.

324
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,519
You can come again tomorrow.

325
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,599
What if we have to see her today?

326
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,079
Then I'm afraid
I'll have to call security.

327
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,800
Never mind.

328
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,199
We should go.

329
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,199
Thank you.

330
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I'm sorry, Lu Xiao.

331
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,840
It's my fault for not checking
the visiting hours ahead.

332
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,519
It's my fault that we ended
wasting this trip.

333
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,759
Kele, it's fine.

334
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm grateful that you're here with me.

335
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,279
We'll just think of this as a chance
to get familiar with the route.

336
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,320
Then let's go back now.

337
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,639
Xu Nian is still waiting for you.

338
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,600
We'll come again tomorrow.

339
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:35,879
But we have rehearsals tomorrow.

340
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:36,920
I might not be able to come out.

341
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,879
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

342
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,239
I'll think of a way for sure.

343
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,320
Don't give up. We are the best.

344
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,040
We can do it!

345
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:38,700
(Crush On Love)

346
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,700
(General Manager Room)

347
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm sorry I'm late again!

348
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,399
I know.

349
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Kele told me

350
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,759
that you were held up.

351
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,200
But I was late again.

352
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,279
We never fixed the time

353
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,840
of our dates.

354
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,399
Did you run all the way here again?

355
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,279
Yes. I didn't want to keep you waiting.

356
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,960
Take this card.

357
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,879
You can use it to grab a ride.

358
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:24,757
(iPass)

359
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,320
That way, you won't have
to run all the way here anymore.

360
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,720
Xu Nian, are you asleep?

361
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,600
We got too excited from dance practice,

362
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,560
and now we can't sleep.

363
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
We finally got the hang
of the hardest moves.

364
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
Come out and see them.

365
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,479
Yes, come out now.

366
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,519
Or we'll forget them again tomorrow.

367
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,479
He might be asleep.

368
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,080
We'll know when we get inside.

369
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,960
What are you guys trying to do?
Dancing so late at night?

370
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,800
Do you really love dancing that much?

371
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,479
Then why don't I have you guys
dance until the morning?

372
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:58,519
No, no, no. That's okay.

373
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,600
We'll dance tomorrow.

374
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,359
Sorry to bother you, Xu Nian.
Good night!

375
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,519
We'll be going then, bye!

376
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,279
They won't notice you with this on.

377
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,560
Do you want that?

378
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,680
I gave you a card, right?

379
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Use it to buy whatever you want.

380
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,600
You can get anything you want.

381
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
Give me the bag. Go on now.

382
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,519
A serving of popcorn, please.

383
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,119
Thank you.

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,999
You bought it?

385
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,320
Here, try some.

386
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,399
How is it?

387
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,159
Tasty.

388
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,119
What are they doing?

389
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,040
They're feeding their "boyfriends".

390
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,519
Boyfriends?

391
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,600
Where are they? I don't see them.

392
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,999
You might be one of their "boyfriends".

393
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:00,519
Or Lu Xiao, Luo Ke, and Su Lie.

394
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,279
This is your game, Love Boys.

395
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,399
These girls can choose

396
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,519
from any one of you

397
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,720
to have date, go shopping, have a meal,
and watch a movie with them.

398
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,840
Anything.

399
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,239
I understand.

400
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,600
It's just like how we were before.

401
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,440
So that's how it looks like

402
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,639
in real life.

403
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,639
They're different from us.

404
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,399
There is no real human being
behind their games.

405
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,840
True. You're the only one
who got the one-on-one service.

406
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,879
We met and fell in love with each other
through this game,

407
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,080
and that's how

408
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,519
we got to where we are now.

409
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,320
Holding hands
and strolling along the streets.

410
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,119
But for them?

411
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,639
They won't have anything to speak for
at the end of the day.

412
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,239
It's just a game.

413
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,920
Is it necessary to expect so much?

414
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,600
At least, they're happy right now.

415
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,519
They seem to be enjoying themselves.

416
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,519
Isn't that enough?

417
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Don't you think you're fooling yourself?

418
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,440
If this game never existed,

419
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
those young women

420
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,960
would be able to look for a partner
in their real lives.

421
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,479
They'll try to understand each other

422
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,279
and learn how to compromise
and how to change for the better.

423
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,040
And they'll be able to acquire
true love and happiness.

424
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,440
A real lover, Xu Nian.

425
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,680
Not a virtual character.

426
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Yes, you have a good point.

427
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,479
But,

428
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,600
these girls couldn't

429
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,800
find a partner in real life.

430
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,080
And that's why they ended up
playing the game?

431
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,119
To find a partner,

432
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,399
a companion,

433
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,960
to love, to understand
and to rely on each other

434
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,119
among this sea of people.

435
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,680
Isn't that something
everyone has to go through in life?

436
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,359
But them?

437
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,440
They're addicted to the game.

438
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,960
They've given all their time and money

439
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,159
to a bunch of data.

440
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,879
That'll only make them
grow further and further away

441
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,359
from reality.

442
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,600
Only one end awaits them at the end,

443
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,560
a life of loneliness.

444
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,040
Qianya. Look.

445
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:51,127
Some people might really
want to find true love

446
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,479
and a partner in real life.

447
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,759
But there are those

448
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,119
who are happy to stay
in their happy world inside the game.

449
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:56,239
As long as

450
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,639
they aren't hurting anyone,

451
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,560
it's their right to choose

452
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,960
to do what they love.

453
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,680
Isn't that right?

454
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,040
Well, then do you know

455
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
just how many couples and families

456
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,119
have been torn apart in real life

457
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,639
because of this game?

458
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,040
I've never been in love
with anyone before,

459
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,639
but I've read a lot of books.

460
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,279
In the books, it's written

461
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,239
that cracks of a relationship
and marriage

462
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,279
begin to appear for internal reasons.

463
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,680
Perhaps we shouldn't place the blame

464
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
for such a complicated phenomenon

465
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,920
onto a game, hm?

466
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,759
That's because you've been
staying inside the Bay House

467
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,399
for over 20 years!

468
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,960
You've never been outside!

469
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:26,119
Everything you know

470
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,440
are from books!

471
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
But things are different in real life,

472
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,720
Xu Nian.

473
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,159
Are... Are you angry?

474
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,440
No, I'm not!

475
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,600
I just think that you're just
the same as Xu Guanghan.

476
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,279
You twist words and use false logic!

477
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:37,960
Qianya...

478
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,800
Don't touch me! Eat your popcorn!

479
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,360
(iPass)

480
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,700
(Xu Guanghan)
(Guan Qianya)

481
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,820
(Xu Guanghan and Guan Qianya
meet in a debate on live-stream.)

482
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,399
(It's true that there is nothing)

483
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,920
(for me to say in this situation.)

484
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,359
(Given all of your intelligence,)

485
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,759
(I think it might be better)

486
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,840
(for me to show it to you.)

487
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,479
(Guan Qianya, women's last hope,)

488
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,639
(and the leader of the opposition
against Y4.)

489
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,879
(Based on the video,)

490
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,560
(it's safe for me to say)

491
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,200
(that Guan Qianya)

492
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,200
(is a heavily addicted player
of Love Boys herself, isn't she?)

493
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,519
It's so hard to change
someone else's mindset.

494
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
Did I rush into things?

495
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,560
Maybe I should've given him more time.

496
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,519
It was only his second time
coming outside, after all.

497
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,800
To find a partner,

498
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,080
a companion,

499
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,680
to love, to understand
and to rely on each other

500
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,920
among this sea of people.

501
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,119
Isn't that something
everyone has to go through in life?

502
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,080
But them?

503
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,159
They're addicted to the game.

504
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,519
They've given all their time and money

00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,999
to a bunch of data.

506
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,960
That'll only make them
grow further and further away

507
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,600

Aunty.

516
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,560
How did you get in here?

517
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,279
Didn't I change the door
and the password?

518
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,680
Let me tell you something.

519
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,479
Your password is super easy to guess.

520
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:03,040
It could only be four numbers!

521
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,560
Your birthday, your father's birthday,

522
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,279
your mother's birthday or my birthday!

523
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,680
But I didn't use any of those this time.

524
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,720
Yes, you didn't.

525
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,560
So I was especially careful this time.

526
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,960
I entered the date of "her" birthday.

527
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,080
And it just...

528
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,359
Slowly opened.

529
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,399
It was amazing!

530
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,680
I never thought

531
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:25,080
that you were such a pure-hearted man.

532
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,040
She had already left the entertainment
business for so many years.

533
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,200
And she married off to another country.

534
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,359
She formed a new family in Canada.

535
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,920
And you still can't let her go.

536
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,639
Aunty,

537
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,159
I must clarify something with you.

538
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,560
I didn't use her birthday
as my password

539
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,239
because I couldn't let her go.

540
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,320
It's because

541
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,960
I thought no one knows her birthday.

542
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,800
How did you know about her birthday?

543
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,239
Don't forget.

544
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,920
She almost became your wife back then.

545
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,479
We went out for meals
and went shopping together.

546
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,999
We did our nails and lashes too.

547
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:56,159
We were such good friends back then.

548
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,879
So both of you

549
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,119
did so many boring things together.

550
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:03,920
These may sound boring

551
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,479
to all of you men,

552
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,680
but to us women,

553
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,840
these are precious moments
of companionship.

554
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,840
Perhaps...

555
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,399
She thought

556
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,399
I was the only closest family you had.

557
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,040
And that's why
she tried to butter me up.

558
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,759
That woman did everything she could

559
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,320
just to get what she wanted.

560
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,999
How many times have I told you this?

561
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,960
Mind your words.

562
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:30,840
Be kind.

563
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,119
If you could have
changed your personality,

564
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,399
she and Qi Chuan wouldn't have left you.

565
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,320
I spent so much time and energy
making them into who they were.

566
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,879
Did they just leave?

567
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,560
No. They betrayed me.

568
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,639
I take back what I said earlier.

569
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,399
If you could've been kinder to them,

570
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,320
they wouldn't have betrayed you.

571
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,279
Is it my fault that they betrayed me?

572
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,479
They betrayed me

573
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,680
because their moral code's gone awry.

574
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
But losing them

575
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,479
is your loss.

576
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,200
It's their loss!

577
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,399
Look at Ge Yilan.

578
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:05,279
She could've been a megastar.

579
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,080
But she ran off to Canada

580
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,639
and became a housewife.

581
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,600
And Qi Chuan?

582
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,800
He doesn't even have enough songs

583
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,519
to open a musical concert
to earn some money.

584
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,119
How could that be?

585
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,320
I was

586
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,999
going to buy a ticket for his concert
to go and see him.

587
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,279
Don't waste your money.

588
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:24,840
He saved me a seat.

589
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,920
You can have it.

590
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,239
But I advise you

591
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,560
not to go and listen
to him singing that one song on loop.

592
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,639
Well, you'd better remember

593
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,040
to save me a ticket
for Y4's concert too.

594
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,359
Y4's concert?

595
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:42,639
You never attended any of their
previous concerts when I invited you.

596
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:44,119
Why are you asking for a ticket now?

597
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,560
It's different now.

598
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,159
The previous concerts

599
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,119
aren't fun at all.

600
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,279
Those were all projections. Fake.

601
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,920
But it's different this time.

602
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,279
They said I'll get to see
and touch them.

603
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,600
Actually, I'm really happy.

604
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,119
You changed.

605
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,960
Have you really figured it out?

606
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,840
That you'll put the four of them
under the sunlight again?

607
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,279
Don't worry.

608
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,879
All will be revealed

609
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,759
at the concert.

610
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,440
He didn't come yesterday.

611
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,040
Is he not coming
to practice today either?

612
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,720
You're actually badmouthing Lu Xiao.

613
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,519
I wouldn't dare say it to his face,

614
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,879
but behind his back...

615
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,320
Let's go.

616
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,279
Let's go.

617
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,639
Lu Xiao, are you ready?

618
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,840
What's wrong?

619
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,040
I think I have a fever.

620
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,560
A fever?

621
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:03,999
You're burning up.

622
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,759
How did you catch a fever?

623
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,399
Was it because of last night?

624
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,239
Last night?

625
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:13,320
Could it be that he couldn't sleep
because we were too loud?

626
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,560
That doesn't have anything to do
with catching a fever, right?

627
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,440
What are you guys doing?

628
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,519
-We...
-We...

629
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,320
Are you all right?

630
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,399
He has a fever. He needs to rest.

631
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,320
Let's go outside.

632
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:34,960
