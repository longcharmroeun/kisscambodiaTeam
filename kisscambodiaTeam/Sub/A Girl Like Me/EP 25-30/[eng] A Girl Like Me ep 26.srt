00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,790
The little brat! Gamble again!

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,070
I’ll have his hide.

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,640
Where’s he?

39
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,150
Upstairs.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
Your Grace, wait for me here.

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Place your bet.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,430
Come on. Place your bet.

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
Whether Count Cheng’an is

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,470
the love child of His Majesty?

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,960
Let’s start from one tael.
No waiting after the set time.

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,400
Place your bet. Come on.

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,750
Whether Count Cheng’an is
the love child of His Majesty?

Stop.

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,310
How dare you

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
distort the royal family in public

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,150
and set up a gamble about it?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,590
Who are you?

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,630
Don’t you know it’s my turf?

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,030
Though gambling isn’t prohibited,

57
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,310
you shouldn’t speak such nonsense.

58
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,910
Are you preaching at me?

59
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,000
Just go home.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,150
Don’t disturb us.

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,190
Exactly. Go home.

62
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,960
-Right.
-What?

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,750
-Go back.
-Go home.

64
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,430
How dare you abuse my man?

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,240
I’m really blind.

66
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,590
I didn’t know

67
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,800
Princess Fule and Count Cheng’an
are here.

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,910
I was just joking.

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,000
Please don’t get angry with me.

70
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I heard everything.

71
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,560
You said Count Cheng’an is a toy boy.

72
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,310
Look at me.

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,430
I just envy Count Cheng’an
for his youth.

74
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
That’s why I used improper words.

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,630
-Improper words.
-Cut the crap.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,360
Let’s resolve this matter

77
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,310
as per gambling rules.

78
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,520
If I win,

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
remove the gambling table.

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,080
If there is still chat

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
about Count Cheng’an from you,

82
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,030
don’t blame me for not being nice.

83
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,120
Well…

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
What if you lose?

85
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,190
If I lose,

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I’ll never inquire into your gambling.

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,840
All his money is yours.

88
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,630
What do you think?

89
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,400
Hua.

90
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,240
It’s my private affair. You need not...

91
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,190
Your business is mine.

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,000
Relax.

93
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,150

101
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,510
I was too ignorant to identify you.

102
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,190
Your Grace.

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,750
Please stop rolling dices.

104
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,310
Mercy on me.

105
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,190
Well, this table...

106
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,830
I’m gonna remove it.

107
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,070
I dare not take Count Cheng’an as a bet.

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,240
That’s more like it.

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
I’ve never thought you have such knack.

110
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,950
Not practicing for a long time,

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,870
I’m a little rusty on it.

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,800
You underestimated my sister.

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,070
She once was famous
for her gambling skills,

114
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,240
the legendary master
in the circle of gambling.

115
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,480
-Ban Heng.
-It hurts.

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,950
Are you looking for trouble again?

117
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,310
Haven’t I told you not
to gamble anymore?

118
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Don’t blame me.

119
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,160
It’s Zhou Changxiao.

120
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Where’s he?

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,070
It hurts.

122
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,750
Remember what I’ve told you?

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,510
Yes.

124
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Losing money in gamble
is easier.

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Listen up.

126
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,870
Life is like a gamble.

127
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,390
You shouldn’t take it too seriously.

128
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,240
Losing money drives you to gamble again

129
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,720
and seek justice.

130
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,510
But forget advancing and retreating.

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Then you’ll lose totally.

132
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,950
I got it.

133
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,430
That’ll be fine.

134
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,510
Go home by yourself.

135
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,430
I send His Grace home.

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
You’ll go to his home again?

137
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,680
Is it Okay?

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,390
You wanna get beaten?

139
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,120
All right. Hua, let’s go.

140
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,480
Hua.

141
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,560
Thank you.

142
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,600
What you said to Heng just now

143
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,870
is also said to me, right?

144
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,950
Is it so obvious?

145
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,600
But you’re right.

146
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,040
Taking life for gambling,

147
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,950
I’ll lose more.

148
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,390
I should’ve moved forward.

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,510
Now, you know it.

150
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,360
It’s worth it.

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,120
It’s my pleasure to have you around me.

152
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,630
Actually,

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,310
His Majesty asking us to
get married at the Moon Palace

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
is to make it up to you.

155
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,510
The rumor’s going around.

156
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,920
There will be many conflicts
in the court.

157
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,310
Rest assured.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,070
I’ll take care of it.

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
Well, let’s go home.

160
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,720
Why do I send you home again?

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,920
Because

162
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,120
without you

163
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,270
I can’t do anything right.

164
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,950
I heard Rong Xia was here.

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Father,

166
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,950
you look better today.

167
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,000
Brother, what you said is improper.

168
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,360
It will be not bad

169
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,000
if he does not make father feel worse.

170
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,630
Why could he cure father’s disease?

171
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,390
Father, haven’t you heard

172
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,480
everyone in the capital said

173
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,630
Count Cheng’an is your love child?

174
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Count Cheng’an neither clarifies it

175
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,120
nor minds it at all.

176
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,630
How despicable!

177
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,750
Nonsense!

178
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Right. I also thought it’s nonsense.

179
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,830
Get out.

180
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,190
Get out of my face.

181
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Your Majesty, you...

182
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,310
Father, did I say anything wrong again?

183
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,510
Get out.

184
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,000
Your Majesty, Luo is straightforward,

185
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,190
but it’s for your good.

186
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,120
The rumor’s going around in the capital.

187
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
It’s not a good thing.

188
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,870
You’re Empress.

189
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,840
How could you believe such rumor?

190
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,670
Of course, I don’t believe it.

191
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,150
Rumor is more fearful than a tiger.

192
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,870
It’d be better if he were my son.

193
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,000
I would be better than now.

194
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,870
No so many worries, either.

195
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,630
Why are you kneeling here?

196
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,080
What you said also makes sense.

197
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,910
If I had a brother like Rong Xia,

198
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,870
he should inherit the throne.

199
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,200
Zhang.

200
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,300
<i>Ding You</i>

201
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,240
Mr. Xie. Count Cheng’an met His Majesty
with a dagger.

202
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,000
Now, the rumor of bastard gets out.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
I’m afraid...

204
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,440
Clearly, it’s time to settle it.

205
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,120
Tell me your scheme.

206
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,480
Tell the followers that

207
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,360
Prince Luo ordered

208
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,120
to kill Rong Xia.

209
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,840
It’s all your fault.

210
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,200
Look.

211
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,240
It’s going to rain.

212
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,750
How should I go home?

213
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,670
If you can’t,

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
why not stay here?

215
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,270
I don’t think your father will mind.

216
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,030
I feel

217
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,960
there must be a catch.

218
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,630
Catch? Why do you say so?

219
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,870
Look.

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,630
You’re knowledgeable.

221
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,510
How couldn’t you know
it would rain today?

222
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,270
You’ve planned it, right?

223
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,910
Hua, you get me wrong.

224
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,670
The weather is not cooperating.

225
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,200
I have no other way.

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,790
All right. I now trust you.

227
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,960
Now?

228
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,000
I swear I didn’t lie to you.

229
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,790
A little salt. A little sugar as well.

230
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,150
Du Jiu.

231
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,720
What on earth does it mean?

232
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,750
It means...

233
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,550
Sir, it’s hard to say.

234
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,240
You tried to keep princess here

235
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,840
just to make her breakfast.

236
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
You’re...

237
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,750
You’re really the model of Daye.

238
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,790
That’s really touching.

239
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,390
Sir, look out.

240
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,390
Du Jiu.

241
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,360
Go to protect Hua.

242
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240
Nothing can happen to her.

243
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,000
Sir.

244
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,720
Obviously, they come at you.

245
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,120
If I’m not with you, what would you do?

246
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,750
Go.

247
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,910
Be cautious.

248
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,240
I won’t get killed so easily.

249
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,270
I wonder

250
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,910
what rewards Xie Chongjin promised

251
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,600
to get a dozen of you here.

252
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,080
We get paid to kill you.

253
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,870
It’s none of your business.

254
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,790
Get ready to die.

255
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Go.

256
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Your Grace.

257
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,960
Your... Highness.

258
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,030
Feixian, I miss you.

259
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,270
Feixian.

260
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,030
Am I on your mind?

261
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,720
You’re drunk.

262
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,480
I wish

263
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,600
I could show you my heart.

264
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,030
I know.

265
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,360
But if you still have affections
for Rong Xia…

266
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,150
Your Highness.

267
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,120
In my heart, there are no others

268
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,510
but you.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
You mean it?

270
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,910
Even if I kill him, is it okay with you?

271
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,000
Kill him.

272
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,720
Hua.

273
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,270
If you get to hurt him,

274
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,030
you have to get my permission.

275
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:21,960
Go.

276
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,840
Hua.

277
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,440
Leave him alive.

278
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,670
Get out of my face,
if you don’t want to die.

279
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,240
You’re just a woman.

280
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,510
How dare you brag?

281
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,750
Go.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,750
Back off.

283
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,070
Hua.

284
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,960
I’m busy today

285
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,480
and have no time to play with you.

286
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,160
Kill him.

287
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,070
Don’t try to hurt him.

288
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,030
Sir.

289
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,680
Sir.

290
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,920
Hua. You got hurt.

291
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,310
What do I usually tell you?

292
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,680
Don’t just read.

293
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
Practice martial arts more.

294
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,510
If you had listened to me,

295
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,440
it wouldn’t end like this, would it?

296
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
You’re right.

297
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,160
It’s my fault.

298
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,960
If it were not for my powerful martial art,

299
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,350
if I hadn’t come in time,

300
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,240
your...

301
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,750
Hua.

302
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,640
Your life...

303
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,270
Hua.

304
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,510
Hua.

305
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,510
Hua.

306
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,310
Miss.

307
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,240
Where are you going in heavy rain?

308
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,640
Well,

309
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,550
Feixian is afraid of thunder
from childhood.

310
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,830
She has no one around her now.

311
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,960
I’m going to accompany her.

312
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,480
I’ll go with you.

313
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,200
No, stay here.

314
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,640
She does not want to be disturbed.

315
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,640
I’ll go by myself.

316
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,590
I’m off.

317
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,070
Miss, be careful on the way.

318
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:42,960
Feixian?

319
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,480
Wanyu...

320
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,680
Jiang Luo. You’re shameless.

321
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,030
Xie Wanyu, are you insane?

322
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,590
It’s between me and Feixian.

323
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,110
Stay out of our business!

324
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,510
As long as it involves Feixian,

325
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,270
I’ll step in.

326
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,480
I’ll call somebody if you don’t leave.

327
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,790
Feixian, go now.

328
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,070
Don’t worry about me.

329
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
Wanyu, it’s true love between us.

330
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,240
Please don’t stop us
from being together, alright?

331
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,510
You told me

332
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,480
you didn’t love His Highness

333
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,000
and you loved Count Cheng’an.

334
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,480
Was it a lie?

335
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,960
Did you cheat me?

336
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Right. I cheated you.

337
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Because I know,

338
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,640
His Highness is your husband

339
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,640
and I shouldn’t love him.

340
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,720
But, love is not based on

341
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,510
the order of arrival.

342
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,480
Wanyu, forgive me.

343
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,720
You’re a cheap crook.

344
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,720
I will

345
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,310
never forgive you.

346
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,270
If I can’t get your forgiveness,

347
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,590
I only have to die.

348
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,750
Feixian...

349
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,350
Xie Wanyu.

350
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,550
For the sake of your brother,

351
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,720
get out.

352
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
If something happens to Feixian,

353
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,030
I’ll make you pay for that.

354
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,030
Wanyu.

355
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,750
Feixian.

356
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,510
It’s a long night.

357
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,350
Let’s continue.

358
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,030
But,

359
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,510
Wanyu is your legal wife.

360
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,640
It’s just a title.

361
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
I only have you on my mind.

362
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,920
Shi Feixian, I treat you sincerely.

363
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,720
But you cheated me.

364
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Seems

365
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
there’s nothing in the capital

366
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,590
worth my cherishing.

Her Grace is in a coma
because of excessive loss of blood.

369
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,110
In the normal sense,

370
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,030
she could wake up soon.

371
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,160
But why hasn’t she?

372
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,920
I have no idea.

373
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,000
I got it.

374
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,440
Thank you.

375
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,510
Thanks for your help.

376
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,640
You’re welcome.

377
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,480
It’s my bounden duty to cure her.

378
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,110
Goodbye.

379
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,720
Hua. It’s my fault.

380
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,310
I never thought a rumor

381
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,830
led to the danger.

382
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,590
I’m sorry.

383
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,100
Hua.

384
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,240
-Hua.
-Hua, I’m coming to see you.

385
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,790
-Hua.
-Hua.

386
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,680
Hua.

387
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,160
Hua.

388
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,550
What happened to you?

389
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,920
You never got hurt since childhood.

390
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,880
Why did you get hurt like this?

391
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
My baby girl.

392
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,240
Mr. Ban, I’m sorry.

393
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,070
I didn’t take good care of her.

394
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,000
Your Grace.

395
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,000
-Don’t blame yourself.
-Hua.

396
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,160
The priority is to

397
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,880
find out the manipulator.

398
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,510
Hua.

399
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,270
I’ll absolutely

400
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,510
find out the person.

401
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,110
Once the person is identified,
I’ll kill him.

402
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,070
Where’s Ban Heng?

403
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
Ban Hua is severely hurt.

404
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,590
Why hasn’t he come?

405
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,750
Your Majesty. He went out yesterday

406
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,160
to prepare wedding gifts for Her Grace.

407
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,960
I’ll get him back immediately.

408
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,790
Hurry up.

409
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,920
What have we done wrong?

410
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,480
Why is Hua’s marriage so difficult?

411
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,160
My baby girl.

412
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,070
It hurts.

413
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,750
It’s me. Ouch.

414
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,790
How come it’s you?

415
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
What are you doing here?

416
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,240
Ban Heng,

417
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,160
are these made by yourself?

418
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,880
You bet.

419
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,920
I only have one sibling.

420
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,400
I definitely want her
to have the best proposal.

421
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,030
But, Count Cheng’an is a bookworm

422
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,480
and can’t get the point.

423
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
So, everything depends on me.

424
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,590
You’re very kind to your sister.

425
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,110
Certainly.

426
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,440
She is my sister.

427
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,680
Don’t your siblings treat you well?

428
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,240
My eldest brother is kind to me,

429
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,750
just because of my identity.

430
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,960
In the end,

431
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,440
I’m still alone.

432
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,070
Nobody cares about me.

433
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,350
Xie Wanyu, you mustn’t cry here.

434
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,310
A master said

435
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,830
this is a good place.

436
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
If you cry,

437
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,030
it will bring bad luck.

438
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,440
Stop crying.

439
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,720
Why… Why did you

440
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,680
get wet?

441
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,310
It’s raining heavily.
What’s the fuss about?

442
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,550
Why didn’t anyone

443
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,550
hold an umbrella for you?

444
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,310
Stop it.

445
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,550
Fine.

446
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,000
You’re lucky.

447
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,440
I prepare this for my sister.

448
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,720
But it’s the time for you.

449
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,030
Go get changed. Don’t get cold.

450
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,110
Or I’ll be in trouble.

451
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,270
Don’t get me wrong.

452
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,790
I’m just afraid you’ll die of illness.

453
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,000
Then I’ll commit a serious crime.

454
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,550
Otherwise, I wouldn’t care about you.

455
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,750
Thank you.

456
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,480
It is quite baffling.

457
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,030
Have you changed yet?

458
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,110
Why does it take so long?

459
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Does it look good?

460
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,270
Err...

461
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,070
Not too bad.

462
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,750
Not bad.

463
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,240
Thank you.

464
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,030
The wedding gown

465
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,920
looks terrific.

466
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,960
Don’t be pretentious.

467
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,350
Though the gown is

468
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,200
not bad,

469
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,590
compared with your wedding gown,

470
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,400
this one is a little inferior.

471
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,720
We even dare not embroider a phoenix.

472
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,550
With phoenix, so what?

473
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,310
If I could choose,

474
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,750
I’d rather marry a true love.

475
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,550
It would be better than now.

476
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,270
A lonely life in the deep palace.

477
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,400
Stop quoting poems.

478
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,510
I don’t understand.

479
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,960
All in all, Jiang Luo is bad for you.

480
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,070
Then find a new one.

481
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,640
Why do you look so sad?

482
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
How is it possible? He’s a prince.

483
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,880
So what?

484
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
He has nothing different
from ordinary people.

485
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,640
You’re just fear of making

486
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,550
you father and brother unhappy.

487
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,880
It’s you who get married.

488
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,750
Why do you be so obedient to them?

489
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,790
Is it possible that

490
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,270
others can give Prince Luo
a baby for you?

491
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,030
Ban Heng!

492
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,550
Sorry. Out to lunch.

493
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,000
Come on. Don’t think too much about it.

494
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,310
Just get by. No big deal.

495
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,310
Just eat well, sleep well.

496
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,720
Take good care of yourself.

497
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,510
After Jiang Luo dies,

498
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,480
you can remarry.

499
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,750
It’ll stop raining soon.

500
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,270
Why not get some sleep?

501
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,240
I’ll tell you when it stops raining.

502
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,460
<i>Poems about Mountains and the Moon</i>

503
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:22,240
Well, here you are.

504
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,380
<i>Poems about Mountains and the Moon</i>
You’ll like it.

505
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,460
<i>Poems about Mountains and the Moon</i>

506
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,110
And these flowers help you sleep.

507
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,000
I put them here.

508
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,380
<i>Poems about Mountains and the Moon</i>

509
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,640
Have a good sleep.

510
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,880
What’s up?

511
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,720
What’s the matter?

512
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,030
Nothing.

513
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,830
It’s just a nightmare.

514
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,790
Nightmare...

515
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,160
Look at you.

516
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,790
I haven’t eaten my chicken in the dream.

517
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
How will you pay for my loss?

518
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,510
Well,

519
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,440
take this.

520
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,880
Bracelet?

521
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,350
Why did you give it to me?

522
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,920
I can’t trade it for chicken.

523
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,590
You can.

524
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,110
What did you say?

525
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,880
Nothing.

526
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,240
Seems it stops raining.

527
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,070
Let’s go.

528
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,110
You may leave first.

529
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,830
If we go back together,

530
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,000
your fame probably will be ruined.

531
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,400
Your bracelet.

532
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,110
It’s yours now.

533
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,200
I don’t like to owe favors.

534
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,510
I’ve kept it since I was a kid.

535
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,640
Keep it for me.

536
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,550
When I divorce with Jiang Luo,

537
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,720
I’ll get it back.

538
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,310
Divorce?

539
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,270
You finally figure it out.

540
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,830
Then, I go get changed.

541
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,070
Bang Heng, after a night of thinking,

542
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,000
I figure it out I should live for myself

543
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,720
rather than for others.

544
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,880
Like Ban Hua,

545
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,670
I want to take control
of my own destiny.

546
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,760
Miss, don’t worry.

547
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,320
You’re in poor health.

548
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,070
You can be pregnant
after some careful treatment.

549
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,190
My lady is not somebody

550
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,630
but the wife of Prince Luo.

551
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,920
Bi’er, stop it.

552
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,360
Wanyu is the wife of Prince Luo.

553
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,000
I’m not blathering.

554
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,710
Prince Luo has stayed here
for several days.

555
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,230
A new baby

556
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,920
can be expected soon.

557
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,030
Go get the medicine with the physician.

558
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,360
Pay attention to it.

559
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,440
Don’t worry.

560
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,710
Your Highness.

561
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,510
Rong Xia.

562
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,070
You just came in time.

563
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,110
I followed Wu Daozi and imitated

564
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,400
the Portrait of Flower-wearing Maid.

565
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,230
-Your Highness.
-Have a look.

566
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,760
Have you heard dozens of martial artists

567
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,920
sneaked into my home and

568
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,510
tried to kill me?

569
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,280
Is it true?

570
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,400
Where is the chief minister
of the Court of Judicial Review?

571
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,630
He should track down the manipulator.

572
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,320
Manipulator?

573
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,320
I have a suspect.

574
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,230
I came to ask

575
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,190
if you get ready for taking over Daye.

576
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,480
Rong Xia.

577
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,230
Father will long live.

578
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,110
Let’s change the subject.

579
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,190
His Majesty once asked me

580
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,510
to assist you in reforming
the governmental abuses.

581
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,030
Now, His Majesty is in poor health.

582
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,360
And assassins came to kill me.

583
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,190
Who do you think the manipulator is?

584
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,510
I...

585
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,230
You know it very well.

586
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,590
Prince Luo is at the same age as yours.

587
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,030
How could he be willing
to be your servant?

588
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,150
After Duke Jingting was assassinated,

589
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,110
I found out that

590
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,000
Prince Luo has close relations with
men of the world.

591
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,400
Those who tried to kill me

592
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,920
were men of the world as well.

593
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,800
Rong Xia.

594
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,360
There must be some misunderstanding.

595
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,230
Luo...

596
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,000
Luo is not like that.

597
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Though I exercise royal functions,

598
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,880
Father is still living.

599
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,630
You’d better discuss with him
about this matter.

600
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,400
You’re kind-hearted,

601
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,710
but others may not be.

602
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,440
Rong Xia.

603
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
I only like planting flowers.

604
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,280
Why do you bother to force me?

605
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,630
Since it is so,

606
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,670
you can pretend I never came here.

607
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,440
Count Cheng’an.

608
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,710
I’ve been waiting for you
for a long time.

609
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
It’s only half a day.

610
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,710
Is Mr. Xie eager to check

611
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,150
whether I’m still alive?

612
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,150
You’re smart.

613
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,440
So, you should know

614
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,960
it’s not my purpose to kill you.

615
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,400
Either Luo or you,
what’s the difference?

616
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,710
My heart aches for

617
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,480
what happened to you.

618
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,710
So, I’m here to work with you

619
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,030
to break the ice.

620
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,440
We don’t share the same belief.

621
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,150
Shi Feixian has come back.

622
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,000
Now, she lives in the courtyard
of Prince Luo.

623
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,960
It turns out you’re afraid of losing

624
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,480
your position.

625
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,190
So, you ask me to join hands with you?

626
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,280
Rong Xia, given the current situation,

627
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,710
this is the best choice.

628
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,920
Master, I’m getting confused.

629
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,400
Isn’t Xie Chongjin following Prince Luo?

630
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,320
Why does he want to join hands with you?

631
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,630
Didn’t he send the assassins to kill you?

632
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,150
Either Luo or him,
that’s no difference.

633
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,480
Shi Feixian is an obstacle for them

634
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,320
and also the soft spot of Prince Luo.

635
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,920
He wanted to use me to kill Shi Feixian.

636
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,440
What’s your plan?

637
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,800
Let’s take a drastic measure.

638
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,030
What a good-for-nothing!

639
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,670
When Hua needs you the most,

640
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,440
where have you been?

641
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:20,840
Hua.

642
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,960
I haven’t been out for a long time.

643
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,670
What happened to you?

644
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,550
Open your eyes and look at me.

645
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,960
If you keep sleeping,

646
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,030
you’ll miss your wedding day.

647
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,710
Your marriage is hard-won.

648
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,840
Go for it.

649
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,670
Shut up.

650
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,800
Nobody treats you as a mute.

651
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,150
Stop making noise.

652
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,630
Physician Yu said

653
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,230
she’s physically recovered.

654
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,510
She just doesn’t want to wake up.

655
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,000
So, she’s been in a coma.

656
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,400
Rest assured. Mr. and Mrs. Ban.

657
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,630
If she doesn’t wake up in one day,

658
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,480
I’ll keep her for one day.

659
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:14,280
If she doesn’t wake up
in one or two decades,

660
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,590
I’ll keep her for one or two decades.
