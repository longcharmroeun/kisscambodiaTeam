36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,020
Young Master.

37
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,100
Go home.

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,780
Young Master, will we really go back?

39
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,380
Won’t you talk to Her Grace again?

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,180
Maybe I was too abrupt.

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,780
I did that without asking her first.

42
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,380
So the thing went like this.

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,700
Now I can’t face Hua.

44
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,700
Princess. Princess is coming for you.

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,860
Will you leave without saying anything?

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,580
The man I love

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,180
can’t crawfish like this.

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,700
Hua.

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,700
I thought too much during the day,

50
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,740
so I refused your proposal.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,660
It makes you sad.

52
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,340
But now I feel regret.

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,420
So are you still willing to marry me?

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,740
I…

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,060
I can refuse you.

56
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,620
But you can’t refuse me.

57
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,300
Go. Don’t look.

58
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,260
Mom is so cool.

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,060
Otherwise, the fireworks I bought

60
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,060
would be wasted.

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Anyway,

62
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,580
what did you say?

63
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,140
I just told your sister

64
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,420
things happened between your dad and I.

65
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,980
What did you say to the girl?

66
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,260
Yeah, what is it?

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Just things happened between us.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,980
What kind of mother you are!

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,820
I, Rong Xia, promise,

70
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,380
I won’t separate with Hua in this life.

71
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
I, Ban Hua,

72
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,180
also promise,

73
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,580
I will do the same.

74
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,900
With such fine view,

75
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,260
there should be some phrases.

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,180
Nature draws without ink.

77
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,260
Rain plays songs with bamboos.

78
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,180
Fireworks are still there
but people have changed.

79
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,020
It’s just a few months.

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,860
I can’t enjoy the fireworks

81
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,900
like before any longer.

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,300
Yes.

I…

88
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
You just ignore your brother.

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,020
Do you forget

90
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,500
I helped you to get him back?

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,100
Mr. Du, can you tell me

92
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,780
who the girl you love is now?

93
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,140
Young Master Ban.

94
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,060
-What? It’s weird.
-Say it!

95
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,940
-You…
-Who is she?

96
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,100
Don’t follow me.

97
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,020
Please tell me.

98
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,540
You are all in couples.

99
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,940
I am the only one alone.

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,020
So sad.

101
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,980
Uh.

102
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,260
What’s going on?

103
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
Why did she come to my mind?

104
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,700
Hey. Son.

105
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,620
Do you want to get married too?

106
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,300
I don’t.

107
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,460
It’s happy to have fun alone.

108
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,980
I don’t need a wife to control me.

109
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,460
Have fun?

110
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,060
You have fun only when you have a wife.

111
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,380
-Yeah.
-No.

112
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,060
So stubborn.

113
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,020
The poems or something like that

114
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,180
fit you.

115
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,620
The flowers are good for sleep.

116
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,340
Have a good sleep. I’d put it here.

117
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,100
Miss, time to sleep.

118
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,740
Miss, time to sleep.

119
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,860
Miss.

120
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,740
Do you want to cook again?

121
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,860
The dishes are great.

122
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,340
But nobody understands it.

123
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,180
It’s still meaningless.

124
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,700
Miss.

125
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,540
Hua, you are still weak.

126
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,900
So you should take more rest.

127
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,180
But you are not here.

128
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,580
It’s boring for me alone.

129
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,100
OK. You’d promise me

130
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,220
you will be careful.

131
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,540
I will feel at ease in that case.

132
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,340
I promise.

133
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,540
Young Master, time for changing dresses.

134
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,620
Or it will be late for going to court.

135
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,820
Hua.

136
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Don’t go anywhere.

137
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,500
I will see you once I finish the work.

138
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,780
I won’t go anywhere.

139
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,620
I’m leaving.

140
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,540
See you.

141
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,180
Bye-bye.

142
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,180
Young Master,
here are clues and evidence.

143
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,380
His Grace’s assassination

144
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,740
is not as simple as what he said.

145
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,700
Things are different.

146
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,980
Du Jiu.

147
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,860
Make sure the Ban’s won’t get involved.

148
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,940
Find out the assassinators.

149
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,740
I won’t forgive them.

150
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,620
One more thing…

151
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,220
In general…

152
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,980
Princess…

153
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,860
Don’t let Count Cheng’an know my plan.

154
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,220
can’t get involved in it.

155
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,780
According to your order,

156
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
we have people pretending

157
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,740
to pay for killing officials.

158
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,940
Nobody took it
no matter how much we paid.

159
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,420
Fude House sent the secret letter

160
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,820
for the date in Qili Pavilion.

161
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,980

162
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,620
<i>Ban Hua Life Price Silver 5,000 taels</i>
Mine is 5,000 taels.

163
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
The prices are proper.

164
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,780
Softy.

165
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,700
Did you find

166
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,740
the list lacks of something?

167
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,540
Even I am on the list.

168
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,740
I don’t think so.

169
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,100
It’s the Xie’s.

170
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,940
Xie…

171
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,660
Do you mean Xie Chongjin did that?

172
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,900
Especially you,

173
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
don’t ever make His Grace know this.

174
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,300
<i>Ban Heng Life Price Silver 100 taels</i>

175
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,740
Why am I just 100 taels?

176
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,660
See? You didn’t practice more.

177
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,700
Now you know you are cheap?

178
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,020
No, something is wrong with it.

179
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,140
Look, Shi Jin is 2,000 taels.

180
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,940

Rong Xia is 3,000 taels.

181
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,860
Shi Jin is more skilled than Rong Xia.

182
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,460
Why is his price lower?

183
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,100
Seems

184
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,060
I have to say something hurting you.

185
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
It’s business.

186
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,100
There must be a buyer.

187
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,020
Heng.

188
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,380
I don’t think anyone wants your life.

189
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,980
Wanna increase your price?

190
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,340
Of course.

191
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,980
Take the action with me tonight.

192
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,380
Weird.

193
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,380
I feel a bit familiar.

194
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,500
Lower your voice.

195
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,860
It’s just an old man.

196
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,420
Don’t be so nervous.

197
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,020
His footstep is steady and powerful.

198
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,380
But it’s silent.

199
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,340
He must be a master.

200
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,780
Master?

201
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,060
Is he the one trying to kill His Grace?

202
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,980
Young Master.

203
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,780
You are just a woman.

204
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,420
How can you talk big like that?

205
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,500
Guys. Action!

206
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,340
That’s him.

207
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,020
He’s the head of the killers.

208
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,220
What are we waiting for? Go get him.

209
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,460
Mr. Shi. Why’re you in Xie’s Mansion?

210
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
I

211
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,420
saw you and I was worrying about you,

212
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,100
so I followed.

213
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,180
Mr. Shi, you are worrying too much.

214
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,900
We are fine.

215
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,620
What’s wrong with you, Mr. Shi?

216
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,100
If the matter of Shunzi
is still confusing you,

217
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,580
it’s unnecessary.

218
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,100
Because I know

219
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,940
it has nothing to do with you.

220
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,140
Thank you for your understanding.

221
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,980
But this is your boudoir.

222
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,340
It’s inconvenient for me to be here.

223
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,620
Martial artists neglect
the minor points.

224
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,780
Yes. And I’m with you.

225
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,020
You are not here alone.

226
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,860
That does make sense.

227
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,900
But there will be gossips.

228
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,300
I’m afraid it’ll distain Her Grace.

229
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,220
Mr. Shi, you must be joking, right?

230
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,420
Does she have any reputation?

231
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,540
How dare you!

232
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,620
Ouch! Ouch!

233
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,300
Mr. Shi is there.

234
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,540
The most important thing

235
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,460
is to find out the Fude House’s Den

236
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
and wipe it out.

237
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,420
But how?

238
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,580
Mr. Shi, do you have a way?

239
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,900
How about we pay someone to do it?

240
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,860
Then Mr. Shi can capture them

241
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,020
and ask for that.

242
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,980
The…

243
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,180
Hua.

244
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,100
My son-in-law is here for you.

245
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,820
Come on. This way.

246
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,300
Hurry.

247
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,820
Look.

248
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,300
I bring you my son-in-law.

249
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,300
Look. My son-in-law is visiting you.

250
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,900
I didn’t expect you to come so late.

251
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,860
Hua.

252
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,220
Young Master Ban is here too.

253
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,780
Heng, you are a man.

254
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,380
How can you sit on the girl’s bed?

255
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,140
Come on. Come here.

256
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,620
She’s not anybody else but my sister.

257
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,220
Hey, kid.

258
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,420
Come on. Sit here.

259
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,060
Leave it.

260
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,780
No. It’s comfortable here.

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,700
You don’t listen to me, right?

262
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,940
You little jerk!

263
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,100
There must be something
I can do with you.

264
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:30,940
Come down!

265
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,630
-Don’t drag, ouch!
-Come down!

266
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,060
Mr. Shi?

267
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,780
Why are you on my daughter’s bed?

268
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Offer your hands. Shi Jin.

269
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,500
And you.

270
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,220
And you.

271
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,860
Say it!

272
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,420
Why are you three

273
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,940
in Hua’s room?

274
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,780
Dad, I’ve said it just now.

275
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,300
We are discussing swordsmanship.

276
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,420
Mr. Shi, say it.

277
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,020
What are you doing on Hua’s bed?

278
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,020
Please forget me, Your Excellency.

279
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,260
We are frank and forthright.

280
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,940
Frank and forthright?

281
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,420
Frank and forthright?

282
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,740
Dad, Mr. Shi is not the one to blame.

283
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,900
I asked him to come.

284
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,380
My girl.

285
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,340
You have an engagement
to Count Cheng’an.

286
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,060
Now you let him be on your bed.

287
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,780
You…

288
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,500
Your Grace…

289
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,460
What’s going on?

290
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,580
I don’t know.

291
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,820
I really don’t know. Dad.

292
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,980
I know nothing about it.

293
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,420
Your Grace, I…

294
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,780
You little jerk! How dare you run away!

295
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,340
Come back. Come back!

296
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,260
Hua.

297
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,060
It’s my fault.

298
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,460
Please don’t blame Her Grace.

299
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,940
It’s my bad.

300
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,780
Your Grace, please don’t get mad.

301
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,860
I won’t get mad.

302
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,980
But you have to tell me

303
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,300
if you are investigating

304
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,060
the case of Fude House.

305
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,620
No.

306
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,660
Definitely not.

307
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,980
Hua.

308
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,740
Yes.

309
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,460
To be honest,

310
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,420
I’m investigating it too.

311
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,980
Under the circumstances,

312
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,620
let’s be frank

313
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,260
and exchange what we know

314
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,380
so that we can get rid of it early.

315
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,700
So,

316
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,260
you aren’t angry with me now?

317
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,220
If you dare do that again,

318
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,700
I will wait in your room every night

319
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
to see who dares to come.

320
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,580
I’d like

321
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,260
to do anything for you.

322
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,820
Young Master.

323
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,460
Say it!

324
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,380
Accountant Zhao Xiancai of Fude House

325
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,100
is take actions.

326
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Where is he?

327
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,620
It’s said all killers of Fude House

328
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,100
will gather Yuzhen House gradually

329
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,460
before tomorrow noon.

330
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,100
A group of killers

331
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,740
gather in the first teahouse openly.

332
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,780
They really get a nerve.

333
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,860
It’s under the blacklight.

334
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,940
Maybe we can only figure it out

335
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,380
after we see it in person.

336
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,860
Feixian.

337
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,300
Your Highness.

338
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,260
Sit down.

339
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,740
Thank you.

340
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,900
What are you sewing?

341
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,460
Can I take a look?

342
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,220
Thank you for your kindness.

343
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,220
I don’t have anything else

344
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,420
but making these things to repay you.

345
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,660
May you realize your ambition

346
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,180
and all your wishes come true.

347
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,500
You are so nice.

348
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,420
I will be with you tonight.

349
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Your Highness, I have something to say.

350
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
But I don’t know if I should.

351
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,340
Just say it frankly.

352
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,420
Only if I can do it,

353
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,260
I will promise you.

354
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,500
Your Highness.

355
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,300
Princess Wanyu is my friend for years

356
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
and we are like sisters.

357
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,780
I’m begging you

358
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,660
not to give her the cold shoulder
for me.

359
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,220
What do you mean by that?

360
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,260
Don’t you hope I

361
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,380
love you more?

362
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,140
I’ve felt sorry

363
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,700
for being loved by you.

364
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,820
How can I fight against her for love?

365
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
You

366
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,660
are too kind.

367
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,300
Don’t worry about Xie Wanyu.

368
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,620
I can say nothing more to her.

369
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,620
When the time is ripe,

370
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,660
I will surely divorce her.

371
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,420
At that time,

372
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,940
you can stay with me

373
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,620
in just ways.

374
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,540
Your Highness, please don’t.

375
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,940
I’ve felt lucky

376
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,180
and satisfied

377
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,220
since I can be with you

378
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,980
like now.

379
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,140
<i>Yuzhen House</i>

380
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,620
I’m a frequent visitor of Yuzhen House.

381
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,740
You investigate the case without me.

382
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,420
You are looking down upon me.

383
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,620
Today, I will show you my competence.

384
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,820
Thank you.

385
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,460
Young Master Ban

386
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,420
Young Master Ban is here. Go welcome.

387
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,220
-Please go ahead!
-Young Master Ban, sorry.

388
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,740
The last room was booked.

389
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,220
It’s OK. I can sit anywhere.

390
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,100
OK.

Stop looking.

393
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,020
So impolite.

394
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,660
My lord, one more.

395
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,980
-God!
-Who is he?

396
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,380
Young man, have a tea together?

398
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,780
<i>Fude</i>
Fude House?

399
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,340
I…

400
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,460
Did you get in the wrong room?

401
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,340
You came in suddenly without a word.

402
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,140
I’m afraid it’s impolite.

403
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,780
What’s going on?

404
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,820
You are asked

405
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
to practice at home.

406
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,220
Why did you come out for tea stealthily?

407
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,300
Yes, why did I come out for tea?

408
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,580
Everyone, I’m sorry

409
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,900
for disturbing.

410
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,180
I will treat you today’s tea.

411
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,900
Yes.

412
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,660
I have a lot of money.

413
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,740
All these for today are on my treat.

414
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,340
Let’s go.

415
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,660
Wait.

416
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
There are a lot of people.

417
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,700
Be careful.

418
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,860
Are you silly?

419
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,620
If Mr. Du weren’t there,

420
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,180
you could be dead, you know?

421
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
You are right.

422
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,700
I won’t do that again.

423
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,980
No, that’s not the key.

424
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,100
The key is I saw people of Fude House.

425
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,620
<i>Fude</i>

426
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,620
And their boss

427
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
seems to be the one we saw at the Xie’s.

428
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,740
It’s critical.

429
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,140
Did you see it clearly?

430
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,380
Of course.

431
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,380
Hua, since you asked so,

432
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,260
I feel it’s just

433
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,900
almost.

434
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,020
Zhao Xiancai was in Yuzhen House too.

435
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,740
So the one you saw

436
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,180
probably be the head of the killers.

437
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,340
So Yuzhen House must have something

438
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,260
to do with Fude House.

439
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,940
Mr. Shi, how about we assign more people

440
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,260
to take them down?

441
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,900
Don’t act rashly.

442
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,940
Maybe there is an ambush.

443
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,140
Yeah. We will capture them all.

444
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,820
Heng.

445
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,620
Why are you looking at me?

446
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,740
Fishing

447
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,140
always needs some bait.

448
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,220
Sir, anything wrong?

449
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,220
You look great.

450
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,140
But the pulse condition

451
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,820
is worse.

452
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,980
Will it affect giving birth?

453
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,020
According to the pulse condition,

454
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,100
it’s hard to be pregnant,

455
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,180
let alone giving birth.

456
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
What?

457
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,700
The tea is ready.

458
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,700
May I have a look?

459
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,180
OK.

460
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,820
Why is there Huanhua Plant in the tea?

461
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,300
Huanhua Plant?

462
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
That explains.

463
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,260
If a female take the herb often,

464
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,500
it will cause a lifelong infertility.

465
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,540
How bold you are!

466
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,180
You dare to poison me.

467
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,300
I dare not.

468
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,420
It’s Mr. Xie.

469
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,460
He said it’s for your health.

470
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,140
I have no idea.

471
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,100
Xie Chongjin

472
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,420
tried to do harm to me
for several times.

473
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,540
I can’t feel at ease

474
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,780
if I don’t take the revenge.

475
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,420
Who are you?

476
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,260
Even you three want to kill me?

477
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,780
Ban, open the door please!

478
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,700
Ban!

479
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,980
Ban. It’s terrible!

480
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,460
It’s a big trouble!

481
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,860
Blabbermouth, what do you want?

482
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Ban, my son Chongjin was assassinated.

483
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,700
It’s very dangerous.

484
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,580
Maybe it’s a life danger.

485
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
Your son is in trouble.

486
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,060
What does it to do with us?

487
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,740
Listen.

488
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,700
Don’t try to bother us again.

489
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,300
Ban, please don’t say that, OK?

490
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,820
I’m begging you for help.

491
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,940
I heard you have

492
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,220
a Physician Yu who is more skilled

493
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,460
than imperial physicians.

494
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,660
Please forgive me

495
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,580
and help my son.

496
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,380
Rocky, go get Mr. Yu.

497
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,220
Yes. Madam.

498
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,500
Thank you. Mrs. Ban.

499
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,420
Ban, look back,

500
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,500
I’m really sorry.

501
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
You are so generous.

502
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,780
Thank you very much.

503
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
We have a lot of troubles before.

504
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,540
Then let’s forget it.

505
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,620
Thank you.

506
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,700
Mr. Yu, please go quickly.

507
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,860
Mr. Yu, please go help him.

508
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,660
Mr. Yu, thank you. Please.

509
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,060
Thank you.

510
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,340
For the Xie family,

511
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,660
the second son got one eye blind.

512
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,340
Now the eldest son was assassinated.

513
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,100
Hope Mr. Yu can really help them.

514
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,540
So

515
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,140
man should always be kind.

516
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,540
Blabbermouth has been too mean

517
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
so he got his family luck away.

518
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Master is right.

519
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
It’s a big trouble.

520
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,460
Why don’t Heng and Hua come out?

521
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,580
Yes.

522
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,020
Young Master went out with Miss.

523
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,100
Go out?

524
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,820
Where are they?

525
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,500
They went for tea.

526
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,500
Tea?

527
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,260
<i>Yuzhen House</i>

528
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,700
Please follow me.

529
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,020
This way please.

530
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,260
Serve me the top tea here.

531
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,900
OK.

532
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,340
<i>Yuzhen House</i>
Sir, come in please.

533
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,700
What is this tea?

534
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,420
How dare you offer me such bad tea?

535
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,420
Young Master Ban.

536
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,100
This is the finest tea here.

537
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,780
Is Yuzhen House

538
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,700
a gangster inn

539
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,660
offering chaff for grain?

540
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,220
You even call this kind of tea

541
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,700
the finest tea?

542
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Go get your boss.

543
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,660
If you don’t make me satisfied today,

544
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,220
I will smash the plate

545
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,700
of your Yuzhen House.

546
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,420
Young Master Ban, please calm down.

547
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,300
I will go get our boss for you.

548
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,420
Hua,
did you recognize the head of killers?

549
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,060
Sir,

550
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,020
Ban Heng is looking for trouble
with a Young Master.

551
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,100
He wants to see you.

552
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,700
I’m afraid they have other purpose.

553
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,740
It doesn’t matter.

554
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,580
I will see him.

555
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,780
You go through the back door.

556
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,940
Yes.

557
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,940
Stop.

558
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,340
You have a dark forehead.

559
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,860
I’m afraid your life is in danger.

560
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,940
How about I tell you the fortune?

561
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,460
Young Master, sorry for our bad service.

562
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,260
This is the finest tea here.

563
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,580
Please try some more.

564
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,340
Don’t block my way. Get out of the way.

565
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Who are you?

566
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,220
It’s just a few days.

567
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,660
But you’ve forgotten me.

568
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,500
You came here yourself…

569
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,420
You think so?

570
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,140
How about we work with her?

571
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,300
Guys.

572
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,620
Find a chance to withdraw.

573
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,300
Action.

574
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,980
Wait.

575
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,500
I have silver.

576
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,620
Are you alright?

577
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,860
I’m fine.

578
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,580
It’s wronged for you

579
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,620
to work in Fude House.

580
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,220
How about confessing here?

581
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,540
If so I’ll allow you
to work in Ban’s Mansion.

582
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,980
Hua, are you OK?

583
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,900
Seems we can’t survive today.

584
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,060
If you can tell us Xie Chongjin’s plot,

585
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,260
I will let you go today.

586
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,060
I won’t eat my words.

587
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,980
Everything runs as per its own rules.

588
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,820
From now on,

589
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,860
no Fude House anymore.

590
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,380
Young Master, it’s poison.

591
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,460
They killed themselves

592
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,420
to protect their boss.

593
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,140
Your Highness, my father is guilty.

594
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,260
If I just get in like this,

595
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,260
it may ruin your fame.

596
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,820
Feixian, don’t worry about it.

597
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,540
I’m with you.

598
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,380
Nobody dares to make you in a pickle.

599
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,820
Your Highness.

600
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,100
Get a wing-room for Miss Shi.

601
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,700
She will live in the Mansion
from now on.

602
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,540
Serve her well.

603
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,060
If you are remiss,

604
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,300
I won’t forgive you.

605
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,900
Yes.

606
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,140
Your Highness,
Fude House has an accident.

607
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,220
Fude House has many masters.

608
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,300
What the accident would be?

609
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,260
None of the masters

610
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,140
in Fude House survives.

611
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,980
Who did that?

612
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,100
Count Cheng’an and Mr. Shi.

613
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,180
Why did they work together?

614
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,740
There are many problems
for the social force.

615
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,820
Where is Xie Chongjin?

616
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,260
He was assassinated.

617
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,300
Now he’s seriously injured
and nursed back to health.

618
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,300
Seriously injured?

619
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,180
He managed Fude House.

620
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,100
Everyone feels terror-stricken about it.

621
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,300
Now it’s destroyed.

622
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,540
And Xie Chongjin was assassinated.

623
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,660
Your Highness.

624
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,860
Count Cheng’an worked with Shi Jin.

625
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,900
They must have someone behind.

626
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,260
Do you mean

627
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
Crown Prince?

628
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,300
Fude House is a force for Xie Chongjin

629
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,020
and you can dispatch it.

630
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,460
But if His Highness wants to
crack you down,

631
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,860
he will surely take actions first

632
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,380
and wipe out Fude House.

633
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,500
Yes.

634
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,580
Feixian, you are right.

635
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,580
Crown Prince is the only one

636
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,420
who can dispatch both of them.

637
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,900
Yun, what’s wrong?

638
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,220
Miss, bad news.

639
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,500
Young Master Chongjin was assassinated
and got seriously injured last night.

640
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,740
What? Assassinated?

641
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,300
Where is Chongjin now?

642
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,780
He’s recovering at home.

643
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,060
Let’s go home and take a look.

644
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,220
Make way. I’ll go home.

645
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,700
Your Grace, we can’t let you go

646
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
without His Highness’s permission.

647
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,220
I’d say it again. Make way!

648
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,780
How dare you be so unbridled?

649
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,660
Back off.

650
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,300
Go down.

651
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,020
Wanyu.

652
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,300
Shi Feixian, I don’t need your help.

653
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,740
You misunderstood me.

654
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,700
I intended to see you

655
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,620
and we see this situation.

656
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
Save it.

657
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,940
I’m tired with such kind of words.

658
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,860
Wanyu.

659
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,300
Miss.

660
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,740
Wanyu, I know you are mad at me.

661
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,620
I don’t want to explain.

662
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,020
I’ve begged His Highness

663
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,940
for allowing you to go home.

664
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,100
He agreed.

665
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,620
Wanyu, trust or not,

666
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,900
I’ve always been caring about you.

667
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,820
Wanyu, just go home soon.

668
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,780
I heard your brother
was seriously injured.

669
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,660
Hope he could be fine.

670
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,260
Back off.

671
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,540
<i>Xie’s Mansion</i>

672
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,780
Please save my son.

673
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,980
Dad, Chongjin…

674
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,140
I don’t take it.

675
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,060
Chongjin.

676
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,780
-Why are you doing this to yourself?
-You…

677
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,300
You still need to take the medicine.

678
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,060
If the wound is infected,

679
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,500
it will be injurious to life.

680
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,540
I’d rather die.

681
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,300
Sir, how is my brother?

682
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,060
We stopped bleeding timely.

683
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,940
There is no danger of life.

684
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,980
But he can’t have children of his own.

685
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,460
You’d better enlighten him more.

686
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,780
Can’t have children?

687
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,860
You mean Xie Chongjin can’t
have children anymore?

688
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,660
Here is the thing, Hua.

689
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,300
I asked Zhou Changxiao to get a killer

690
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,260
to kill Xie Chongjin.

691
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,540
He just refused.

692
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,060
But when we took actions,

693
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,700
Xie Chongjin was assassinated.

694
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,220
Is it Zhou Changxiao paying for it

695
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,380
because he is unreconciled?

696
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,940
Zhou Changxiao isn’t that bold.

697
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,420
Look.

698
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,140
They didn’t kill Xie Chongjin

699
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,980
but make him unable to
have a baby anymore.

700
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,580
In my opinion,

701
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,020
it’s for love.

702
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,380
It makes sense.

703
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,460
I can’t believe Xie Chongjin is spoony.

704
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,900
Miss! Miss!

705
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,740
An eunuch from the Palace said

706
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,380
His Majesty wants to see you
and Count Rong.

707
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,780
Please go to the Palace immediately.

708
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,780
Your wedding is drawing near.

709
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,740
I got you

710
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,660
a superior house in the capital.

711
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,780
Take it as my gift for you.

712
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,300
Your Majesty, I can’t accept that.

713
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,420
It’s too big as a gift.

714
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,140
I give it to you,
so you only need to accept it.

715
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,820
That will make me happy.

716
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

717
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,420
Just tell me if you need anything.

718
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,340
Your wedding ceremony

719
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,940
must be big enough.

720
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I’m old.

721
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,340
I like happy things.

722
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

723
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.
