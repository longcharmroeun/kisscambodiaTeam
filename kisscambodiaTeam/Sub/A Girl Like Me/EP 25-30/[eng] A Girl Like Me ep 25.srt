36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,000
Even without Minister Shi,

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,120
you’re still sulking

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,240
as I heard, Count Cheng’an.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Why is that?

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
Prince Luo, if I understand correctly,

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,750
our appointment
is about something shady, right?

42
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,120
As secretive as it seems,

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,840
it’s just what you’re longing for.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Why don’t you cut to the chase,
Prince Luo?

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,960
You can sleep on it.

46
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,150
I’m sincerely trying to help you

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,310
and I’ve prepared everything

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
to bring justice to you

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
and your deceased family.

50
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,190
Hold on.

51
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,430
Where are you going?

52
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,030
I’m ordered

53
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,430
to make a delivery by His Highness.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,680
Really?

55
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,630
What is it?

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,430
For whom?

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,400
I...

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,750
I have no idea.

59
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,960
Show me what’s in the basket.

60
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,150
What are these for?

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,360
Please don’t make it difficult for me.

62
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,080
I really don’t know.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
You don’t know?

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,030
Guards!

65
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,590
Take him to the local authority.

66
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,240
Your Highness,

67
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,000
I’m asked to deliver it
to the courtyard.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,030
That’s all I know.

69
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,750
What are you doing?

70
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,750
I should ask you that.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,030
Who’s the slut

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,710
that you’re giving the jewels to?

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,870
I can give them to whoever I like.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,510
It’s none of your business.

75
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,160
You...

76
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,270
Please calm down, Your Highness!

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
She didn’t mean to annoy you.

78
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,560
Steward.

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,950
Yes, Your Highness.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,430
Put everything back.

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,310
Yes.

82
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,680
He’s crossed the line!

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,720
I can’t take this.

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
Don’t stir up more trouble,
Your Highness.

85
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,190
We don’t know who we’re against.

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
What if something goes wrong?

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,750
What’s there to be afraid of?

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
I’m bestowed to him

89
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,430
by His Majesty.

90
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,830
She should be afraid of me, if anything.

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
Find out

92
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,040
who he’s seeing behind my back.

93
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,190
Yes.

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,390
Feixian.

95
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

96
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,040
Feixian,

97
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,950
I’m so glad that you’re safe.

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,950
I thought

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,750
I could never see you again.

100
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,870
I’m fine, Your Highness.

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,830
Don’t worry.

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,720
Don’t call me Highness.
That’s for strangers.

103
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,870
Feixian,

104
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,630
you aren’t mad at me anymore?

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,240
Wanyu,

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
it was all my fault.

107
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,680
I didn’t mean those hurtful things

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,720
I spewed out in a rage that day.

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,800
When I was in exile to Xizhou,

110
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,390
all I could think of

111
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,040
was the days we spent together.

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,950
I realized

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,310
how much I missed you

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,160
after losing my family,

115
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,630
but I didn’t get to tell you that.

116
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,800
I’m so sorry.

117
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,240
Feixian,

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
thank you for forgiving me.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,950
All these years,

120
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,190
I’ve always regarded you as my sister.

121
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,390
After you left,

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
you don’t know

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
how much

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,680
I missed you day and night.

125
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,040
I didn’t think you’d
run into such a villain.

126
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,560
Luckily, you managed to escape

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
unharmed.

128
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I returned to the capital,

129
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,600
but I found Grandfather was dismissed

130
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,680
and Shi’s Mansion was sealed.

131
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,510
I didn’t know where to go.

132
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,800
Coincidently,

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,360
I met Prince Luo and he helped me.

134
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,830
Rest assured, Wanyu.

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,430
I won’t stay here for long.

136
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,360
Feixian. You could’ve written to me.

137
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
If I had known you returned,

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,800
I’d have found you a place
to settle down.

139
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,390
I used to treat you badly.

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,950
How could I ask you for help?

141
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,270
It’s all in the past.

142
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,800
It must be that Heaven was touched

143
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,270
by our sisterhood and have you here.

144
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,680
Feixian. Just be frank and tell me.

145
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,950
It doesn’t matter.

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,840
It’s very safe to stay here,

147
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,790
but...

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,870
You fear that

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,510
it could bother His Highness and me?

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Feixian.

151
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,630
I’m reluctant to say this,

152
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,910
but I don’t think

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
His Highness is good enough for you.

154
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,270
You don’t have to bear this.

155
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Wanyu. You know it

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,630
that I love Count Cheng’an.

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,030
But now,

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,720
where else can I go?

159
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,270
Don’t worry. Leave this to me.

160
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,820
I’ll help you out.

161
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,420
Your Grace.

162
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,220
Young Master was urgently summoned
to the palace.

163
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,260
What was so urgent?

164
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,420
The eunuch came and said

165
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,540
His Majesty felt unwell

166
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,220
and asked Young Master
to go to his bedroom

167
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,380
for important issues.

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,340
Would he do anything stupid?

169
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,780
Your Highness.

170
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,820
In Father’s bedroom,

171
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,740
all the people are mine except Wang De.

172
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,220
Count Cheng’an.

173
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,180
It’s the best time for your revenge.

174
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,220
You want to slay the emperor by my hand?

175
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,700
As for what you are investigating,

176
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,220
you can get revenge for your family

177
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,140
or you will get yourself doomed.

178
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,580
Don’t worry.

179
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,820
I’ll leave a way

180
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,980
for the Ban family and you.

181
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,140
I’m sure

182
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,860
you know what to do.

183
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,100
Your Majesty. Slowly.

184
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,540
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,500
Rong.

186
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,780
You come at the right time.

187
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,380
I have something to talk with you.

188
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,060
You may leave.

189
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,940
Come and sit.

190
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,300
Your Majesty.

191
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,500
Shi Chonghai and Yan Hui
gang up for their own gains.

192
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,740
They’re powerful and overwhelming.

193
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,460
Your Majesty, do you really not know it?

194
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,980
They both helped me ascend the throne.

195
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,860
That’s why I was misled by them.

196
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,780
They all helped you ascend the throne.

197
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,220
Why did Old General Ban and my father

198
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,620
get killed by poison?

199
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,500
Rong Xia!

200
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,900
Given your contributions to the state,

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,780
I’ll pretend that

202
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,820
you didn’t say anything.

203
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,220
Leave.

204
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,140
Unless

205
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,060
you tell me what happened back then,

206
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,580
I wouldn’t leave even if I’d die.

207
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,620
How bold!

208
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,060
If you insist,

209
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,900
don’t blame me
for ignoring our affections.

210
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,140
If you don’t tell me the truth,

211
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,740
how can I know your affections
are out of pity

212
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,740
or guilt?

213
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,740
Rong Xia!

214
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,860
I

215
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,020
only want the truth.

216
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,060
You want the truth?

217
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,620
Alright.

218
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,740
Let me tell you the truth.

219
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,300
Back then,

220
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,020
I was enthroned in danger

221
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,100
and many things were to be done.

222
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,260
Only with the joint support

223
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,220
by the four families,
Ban, Rong, Yan, Shi,

224
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,420
could I restore the court.

225
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,060
Unexpectedly, after three months,

226
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,460
Old General Ban was poisoned
at the banquet.

227
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,740
Your father also got killed by poison.

228
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,780
Even your brother got drown
for no reason.

229
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,540
I was resentful but unable
to do anything,

230
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,540
for I couldn’t find the culprit.

231
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,820
Not until Princess Royal took you
into the palace,

232
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,460
did I realize

233
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,660
it’s plotted
by Prime Ministers Yan and Shi.

234
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,180
You were not supposed to take me in.

235
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,940
You should have punished Yan Hui
and Shi Chonghai for justice!

236
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,820
You think I didn’t want to?

237
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,020
But people needed peace and stability.

238
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,060
I had to swallow it.

239
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,220
Do you know why

240
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,500
I keep you by my side?

241
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,500
Not only to avoid

242
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,620
Shi Chonghai and Yan Hui
from hurting you,

243
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,380
but also to pay

244
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,780
what I owed to your father

245
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,980
all to you.

246
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Your Majesty.

247
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,060
Why do you make it so emotional?

248
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,980
You keep me only to use me.

249
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,300
Use the blood debt of my family

250
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,260
to counterbalance Yan Hui
and Shi Chonghai.

251
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,420
It’s been over ten years.

252
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,540
My kindness to you cannot be fake,

253
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,780
can it?

254
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,020
True or fake, does it matter?

255
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,220
You had many choices to make,

256
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,140
yet you turned a blind eye to them,

257
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,100
and overindulged them

258
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,500
to control the state affairs,

259
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,820
hurt the people and endanger the state.

260
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,940
It’s outrageous.

261
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,020
Sorry,

262
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,780
but I cannot tolerate it.

263
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,340
What... What do you mean by that?

264
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,620
You want to kill me?

265
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,460
My kindness to you is always true.

266
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,740
I’ve given you everything

267
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,100
you wanted.

268
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,860
Everything?

269
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,060
Everything?

270
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,220
I want my parents alive.

271
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,220
I want all my family alive.

272
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,420
Sorry but I cannot be like you,

273
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,780
being blinded

274
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,060
by power.

275
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,740
Don’t!

276
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,100
You are...

277
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,740
From now on,

278
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,300
our bond is severed like this robe,

279
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,700
whether kindness or grudge.

280
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,500
We have no affections anymore.

281
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,940
Hua.

282
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,060
Thank you.

283
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,140
But

284
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,340
I didn’t do anything for you.

285
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,260
Actually,

286
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
your chicken soup awakened me.

287
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,820
That soup was very bitter.

288
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,860
It’s bitter indeed.

289
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,940
But after the bitterness,

290
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,700
there was some sweetness lingering on.

291
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,980
Hua, you are right.

292
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,100
I’m no longer alone.

293
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,460
I have you.

294
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,500
I’m glad

295
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,380
that you think so.

296
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,980
Rest assured. I promise.

297
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,740
In the future,

298
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,820
I’ll never let you worry about me.

299
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,980
Count.

300
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,580
You questioned His Majesty like that.

301
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,060
If he killed you

302
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,020
out of anger,

303
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,540
my sister would really
be a predestined widow.

304
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,260
His Majesty did that

305
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,900
because he felt guilty about the past.

306
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,340
Otherwise, how could he be so kind

307
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,140
to Count Cheng’an and our family
all the time?

308
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,660
Father.

309
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,180
Now that both the two families
have fallen,

310
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,540
you’re likely to
be Prime Minister again.

311
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,300
And more likely for Count Cheng’an.

312
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,540
We have made the decision.

313
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,780
We’ll resign and stay away
from the court,

314
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,060
leading a happy and carefree life.

315
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,420
To live better than them

316
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,020
is also a way of revenge.

317
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,220
I’m afraid

318
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
His Majesty

319
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,580
wouldn’t allow Count to leave.

320
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,100
Your Excellency. Madam.

321
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,940
Young Master. News from the palace.

322
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,220
His Majesty fainted.

323
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Why did he faint?

324
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,300
Don’t know.

325
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,060
Father, I’m going to inquire.

326
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,500
Count, be very careful

327
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,780
before I get back.

328

329
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,340
Your Majesty.

330
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,820
Come over.

331
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,660
Where is Rong Xia?

332
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,140
Your Majesty.

333
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,020
Give him some time.

334
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,420
Daye

335
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,820
cannot lose him.

336
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,860
Father.

337
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,740
I think Rong Xia must be too impulsive.

338
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,300
Hua, Father is right.

339
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,020
Now the state has no Prime Minister.

340
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,060
Rong Xia shouldn’t leave at this time.

341
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,820
Rong Xia.

342
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,660
Hua says you have something
to talk to me.

343
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,140
Your Highness.

344
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,660
This is Old General Ban’s Tiger Tally.

345
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,980
Rong Xia, what do you mean by this?

346
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,220
Your Highness,

347
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,060
please give it to His Majesty.

348
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,260
Tell him it’s found by you,

349
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,700
so that the court can be stabilized

350
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,540
and your position can be reinforced.

351
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,700
With you here,

352
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,260
why should I worry about the court?

353
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,020
Cousin Zhang.

354
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,300
We hand over the Tiger Tally,

355
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,660
because we mean to leave the court.

356
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,860
That won’t do.

357
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,980
Rong Xia, Father is sick.

358
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,140
The state needs you.

359
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,060
It’s our wish.

360
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,020
Please approve it, Your Highness.

361
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,300
Yes.

362
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,020
Your Majesty, the physician said
you just woke up

363
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,980
and needed more rest.

364
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,340
What are you looking for
in such a hurry?

365
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,420
I am

366
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,660
looking for the script

367
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,260
when I gave name for Rong.

368
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,220
Why are you looking for it?

369
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,980
I want him to know that

370
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,260
I’m sincere to him.

371
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,780
I don’t want him to leave me

372
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,140
or blame me.

373
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,620
Your Majesty, go back to rest.

374
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,820
I can help you look for it.

375
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,980
No, I’ll do it myself.

376
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,300
Why bother?

377
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,140
I found it.

378
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,620
I found it. I wrote this.

379
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,260
I... I gave him the name.

380
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,740
Your Highness.

381
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,060
How is His Majesty?

382
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,860
The physician diagnosed that

383
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,460
His Majesty has a serious fever

384
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,660
due to the cold,

385
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,420
but it gets serious

386
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,100
due to anxiety.

387
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,340
Can it be cured thoroughly?

388
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,620
It is mental disease.

389
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,300
It depends on if His Majesty

390
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,340
can open up his mind.

391
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
This is...?

392
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,660
The thing that troubles His Majesty.

393
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,660
<i>Rong Xia</i>

394
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,580
It’s personally written by His Majesty

395
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,460
and offered to your family.

396
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,420
Your Highness.

397
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,340
Could you please

398
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,540
tell me the origin

399
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,220
of it?

400
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,180
I clearly remember

401
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,260
it was at 11:00 PM
on the Start of Autumn.

402
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,300
His Majesty and I were about to sleep,

403
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,660
while Wang De brought us a message.

404
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,860
Your Majesty. Being blessed by you,

405
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,620
Mr. Rong got a son.
Mrs. Rong and the baby are both safe.

406
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Great!

407
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,020
Really?

408
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,300
I must give Rong and his wife

409
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,140
a big gift.

410
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,380
<i>Xia</i>

411
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,660
Your Majesty,
forgive me for my ignorance.

412
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,900
What’s the meaning of the name?

413
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,540
“Xia” means the defect on a jade.

414
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,140
People tend to see it as a defect.

415
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,300
“Rong” is his surname.

416
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,180
“Rong Xia” shows my...

417
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,660
His Majesty’s blessings to you.

418
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,780
Wish the child...

419
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,740
Wish the child might have shortcomings

420
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,300
and make mistakes,

421
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,740
but people would tolerate
and forgive him,

422
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,020
and give him a chance
to right the wrong.

423
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,500
Rong Xia, I know you’ve been

424
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,260
bearing a grudge.

425
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,980
I don’t expect your forgiveness.

426
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,700
But the court cannot lose you.

427
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,580
The people cannot lose you.

428
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,340
Father.

429
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,980
Rong Xia gave me this.

430
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,100
For you,

431
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
I’ve lost too much.

432
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,860
Go.

433
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,420
Summer Count Cheng’an to me.

434
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,220
Father.

435
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,700
For the sake of
his loyalty and devotion,

436
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,260
I beg you.

437
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,460
Please spare him.

438
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,060
My son.

439
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,740
Count Cheng’an found Tiger Tally for me

440
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,420
and settled what had been haunting me.

441
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,620
I would greatly reward him.

442
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,300
I’m going right now.

443
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,740
We’ve arrived, Count.

444
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,900
Count, if you still feel upset,

445
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,300
you may take a rest inside.

446
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
I’m not upset.

447
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,940
After so many years,
it comes to an end anyway.

448
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,180
Your Grace, Count.

449
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,940
I finally catch up with you.

450
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,220
His Majesty has an edict for you.

451
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,700
Please take it in person.

452
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,980
I’ve issued an edict that

453
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,860
Count Cheng’an and Ban Hua
will marry in Moon Palace

454
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,620
by the ritual for princes.

455
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,020
Father, what did you say?

456
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,860
Your Majesty, since the state was found,

457
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,140
no outsider has ever married
in the palace.

458
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,500
Is it improper to do this?

459
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
From today on, a precedent is set.

460
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,340
I’m the emperor. I have the final say.

461
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,940
What is improper?

462
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,740
Father, you have a point.

463
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,460
But according to books,

464
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
the emperor shall stick to rules,

465
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,620
which are passed from ages.

466
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,260
If it goes against rules, I think...

467
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,420
You bastard!

468
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,260
You barely read books,

469
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,460
yet you dare to talk
about rules with me?

470
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,060
Calm down, Father.

471
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,340
Listen up.

472
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,060
It’s my decision.
No one shall object it.

473
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,100
Your Majesty. Please calm down.

474
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,620
Count Cheng’an is
the pillar of the state.

475
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,060
And we watched Ban Hua growing up.

476
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,180
You may count on me

477
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,220
to make the schedule

478
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,140
and take care of their wedding.

479
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,100
I will not let them down. How is it?

480
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,780
Zhang!

481
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,180
Luo.

482
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,980
Zhang.

483
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,420
Luo.

484
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,100
Do you have anything

485
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
to talk with me?

486
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,300
Zhang. About what Father said,

487
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,260
do you just accept it?

488
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,860
Count Cheng’an is a subject.

489
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,220
How can he get married in Moon Palace?

490
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,140
I don’t feel it proper either.

491
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,740
But on second thought,

492
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,780
Hua is our cousin,

493
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,380
half a royal to some extent.

494
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,780
Rong Xia is loyal as well,

495
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,500
and has made many achievements.

496
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,380
So, Father’s decision is...

497
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,220
Zhang.

498
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,460
The other day,
Rong Xia threatened Father

499
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,220
with a dagger.

500
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,260
Have you forgotten it?

501
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,620
Luo. Don’t... Don’t talk nonsense.

502
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,140
We are in the palace.

503
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,260
You’ll put him in danger.

504
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
In danger?

505
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,740
He is a subject to us.

506
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,780
How can he break the rule?

507
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,660
What... What do you mean?

508
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
I really doubt if we are brothers

509
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,620
sharing the same blood

510
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,420
in our veins.

511
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,660
Zhang.

512
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,900
Father ordered him to resettle refugees.

513
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,660
Do you know it?

514
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,740
Now refugees are swarming
in the capital.

515
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,700
If His Majesty knows it,

516
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,540
he will surely be furious.

517
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,540
Do you understand what I mean?

518
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,300
I... I don’t quite understand.

519
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,940
You are hopeless.

520
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,980
Never mind. I can get another way
to deal with him.

521
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,420
Luo... Luo!

522
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,460
Don’t do anything stupid!

523
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,140
The 28th next month is said
to be a good day.

524
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,500
But what is it

525
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,740
to do with me?

526
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,860
Turns out

527
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,940
my own wedding is arranged by others.

528
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,260
And he is the emperor.

529
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,620
You cannot disobey him.

530
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,020
Don’t feel bad for it.

531
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,460
If you don’t like this wedding,

532
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,940
I’ll hold another one for you.

533
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,940
Really?

534
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,140
Don’t you think I’m melodramatic?

535
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,260
Of course not.

536
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,860
It only happens once in your life.

537
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,420
Of course you need to consider

538
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,740
how to have a grand wedding.

539
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,780
How could it be melodramatic?

540
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,780
Now that I decide to marry you,

541
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,380
I shall give you the best.

542
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,860
I will never let you feel upset.

543
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,500
Who said I could only marry once?

544
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,780
Many girls remarried in the capital.

Sir.

563
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,580
Two coins in cash.

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,300
Sure.

565
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,740
Just a wedding.

566
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,620
Where it will be held doesn’t matter.

567
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,460
A wedding ceremony in Moon Palace

568
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,860
is the one and only in the capital.

569
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,060
It’s good.

570
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,420
Thank you, Suyue.

571
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,900
The Shi family has fallen.

572
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,660
Those flatterers

573
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,580
were all gone.

574
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,340
You get implicated,

575
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,420
and can’t even have some hot tea.

576
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,340
Is Crown Prince cold to you?

577
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,060
He’s good as ever.

578
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,100
But Feixian is missing.

579
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,380
I’ve mentioned it to him several times,

580
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,660
but he refused by the excuse

581
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,540
of His Majesty’s sickness.

582
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,180
Since Crown Prince is good to you,

583
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,700
don’t worry about other issues,

584
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,540
lest your relationship is affected.

585
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
As for Feixian,

586
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,140
my friends at the border would help.

587
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,620
There will be a result anyway.

588
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,420
I never thought

589
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,260
the three of us

590
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,900
would end up like this.

591
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,020
We don’t know Feixian is alive or dead.

592
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,220
Your marriage is also delayed.

593
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,700
If Feixian can be found,

594
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,220
my marriage

595
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,300
is no hurry.

596
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,740
Jin.

597
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,180
Ban Hua is going to get married.

598
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,660
Do you still hold on it?

599
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,940
I’ve been on it for years.

600
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,980
I can’t let it go that easily.

601
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,820
Hurry.

602
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,980
Your...

603
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,540
<i>Yongsheng Casino</i>

604
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,220
<i>Good Fortune Yongsheng Casino</i>

605
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,620
Ban. Ban. Ban.

606
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,940
Who is it? Zhou Changxiao.

607
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,820
Why are you hugging me in public?

608
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,180
Ban, you finally come.

609
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,980
You have no idea

610
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,780
how skilled the new gamblers are.

611
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,300
They play dice like magic.

612
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,020
I’ve even lost my pants.

613
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,980
Ban.

614
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,420
You must help me win them back.

615
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,180
Stop.

616
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,740
I’ve promised my sister

617
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,900
not to play dice again.

618
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,740
Ban, it’s not about money.

619
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,260
It’s about dignity.

620
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,420
If you

621
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,420
don’t teach them a lesson today,

622
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,100
they will show no respect

623
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,140
to you and me.

624
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,420
It’s your dignity.

625
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,300
None of my business.

626
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,340
We’ve been friends for years.

627
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,780
How can you stand by?

628
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,500
Ban, just two rounds. Just two.

629
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,380
Not for money. Just to help me.

630
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,860
Alright.

631
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,860
Well... Let’s have a deal.

632
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,220
Only two rounds.

633
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,380
Yes. Just two.

634
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,460
Let’s go.

635
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Come on. Go.

636
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,980

Big or small. Buy and move hands off.

637
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,860

Big or small. Buy and move hands off.

638
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,660
Big! Big! Big!

639
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,060
One, two, three! Small!

640
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,420
<i>Big</i>

641
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,780
Wager on big again.

642
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,420

643
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,140
Big or small. Buy and move hands off.

<i>Big Small</i>
Big or small. Buy and move hands off.

645
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,900
<i>Big Small</i>
I’ll wager on small again.

646
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,420
<i>Big</i>
Big.

647
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,940
You wager on big? I wager on small.

648
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,820
<i>Small</i>
You wager on big? I wager on small.

649
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,500
One, two, three! Small!

00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,740

Come on. Silver.

653
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,100
Go on.

654
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,900
Fine. Big again.

655
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,540

656
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,940

Small! Small!

660
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,820
I listen to you. Big.

661
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,780
Come on. Sliver.

662
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,020
Small.

663
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,580
Go on. Come on.

664
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,020
The silver is all mine.

665
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,660
This is yours.

666
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,820
Gentleman.

667
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,340
You win every game.

668
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,740
You are in great luck, aren’t you?

669
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,700
Let me tell you, man.

670
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,180
I win every game

671
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,380
because of this.

672
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,580
What is it?

673
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,700
This is

674
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,900
the most popular amulet in the capital,

675
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,580
Count Cheng’an Amulet.

676
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,500
Can Count Cheng’an bring good luck?

677
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,780
Listen to me.

678
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,180
There’s news from the palace

679
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,860
that Count Cheng’an

680
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,700
is the emperor’s love child.

681
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,020
Love child?

682
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,220
Think about it.

683
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,420
He’s taken by the emperor
as a son at 20.

684
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,340
Shouldn’t we pray to him for good luck?

685
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,260
Yes. Pray.

686
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,220
Let’s pray.

687
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,780
Come on. Go on.

688
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:02,940
Go on. Go on.

689
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,940
Have... Have you heard about it?

690
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,100
Count... Count Cheng’an is going to
be Prime Minister.

691
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,660
All the court affairs

692
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,500
will be

693
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,460
in his charge.

694
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,940
That’s no big deal.

695
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,460
He’s His Majesty’s love child.

696
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,620
To be Prime Minister is nothing.

697
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,580
Even if His Majesty passes
the throne to him,

698
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,740
I won’t have a blink of eyes.

699
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,580
I heard that

700
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,420
the edict to pass him the throne
has been written

701
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,220
and hung behind the plaque in the hall.

702
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
What a coincidence.

703
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,540
I have a doll of Count Cheng’an

704
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,500
in Crown Prince’s wear.

705
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,260
It looks good.

706
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,260
Keep talking! Why do you stop?

707
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,820
Don’t you like gossiping?

708
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,780
Should I

709
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,460
sew up your mouth?

710
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,500
Forget it, Hua.

711
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Just some gossips.

712
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,220
Don’t lower yourself to their level.

713
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,620
Go. Go. Go.

714
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,100
I’m thick-skinned and get used to it.

715
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,860
But you are different.

716
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,900
Since we got together,

717
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,140
you’ve been bothered by gossips.

718
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,100
That’s annoying.

719
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
You are underestimating me.

720
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,820
I can be with you.

721
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,820
The gossips are nothing.

722
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,420
But I do think

723
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,420
this doll of me is pretty cute.

724
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,220
How about making another one for you

725
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,300
to be a pair?

726
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,180
Your Grace! Your Grace!

727
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,420
Bad news!

728
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,020
Young Master got detained in the casino.
