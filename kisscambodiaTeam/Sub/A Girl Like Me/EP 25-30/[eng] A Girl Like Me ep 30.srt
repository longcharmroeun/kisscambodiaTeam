Princess Fule, Count Rong.

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,630
Why are you here?

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,310
Mr. Shi, don’t be surprised.

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
His Majesty has allowed us

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
to get married.

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,560
We are specially invited here.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Congratulations.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Sorry for being rude.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,910
Please come in.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,630
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,630
Luo, there you are.

48
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,840
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,430
Pay my respects to you.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,750
You are exempt.

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,150
Father will be very pleased

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,680
to see you two so affectionate.

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,240
You are way more affectionate than us.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,750
Don’t say that.

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,630
Husband and wife should
live a happy life

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,960
and respect each other.

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,080
You two should be more in love

58
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,680
and strive to have a baby soon.

59
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,080
You have no children yet,

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,280
how dare I have a baby ahead of you?

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,190
It’s getting late.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,470
Zhang, you’d better get in now.

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,910
Offer blood!

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,520
Offer five cereals!

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,960
Offer wine!

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
Why are you absent-minded?

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,120
Still worried about
your brother’s injury?

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,750
My brother is fine.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
Thank you for your concern.

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,920
You look nervous.

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Is there any hidden secret?

72
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,430
You are making a joke.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,510
There is no secret.

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,040
Did Jiang Luo treat you badly?

75
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,040
No.

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,430
In your life, you can’t

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,830
make do with someone you don’t love.

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,630
Are you willing to waste

79
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,240
the rest of your life in Wude Palace?

80
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,720
You mean...

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,120
I mean

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
if you keep putting up with it,

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
you are wasting your life on that idiot.

84
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,430
Burn incense and pray!

85
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,920

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,600
I didn’t get anything.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,870
Do you have any news?

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,390
Prince Luo has been
focusing on the ceremony.

102
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,830
There is no sign at all.

103
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,680
I don’t know if he is plotting something

104
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,040
or there is no plan at all.

105
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,070
Sure enough.

106
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,270
His Highness thinks too highly of him.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
I think

108
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,040
he dares not to make any trouble today

109
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,630
even we ask him to do it.

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,390
The ceremony is not over yet.

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,390
Hua, you mustn’t take it carelessly.

112
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,830
The ceremony is finished.
Thank you for your efforts.

113
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,870
Please enjoy the coarse food.

114
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,720
The first one, please.

115
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,040
What are these strange things?

116
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,430
Scallion pancakes?

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,510
The second one, please.

118
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Rice?

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,750
The third one, please.

120
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,950
The third one.

121
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Let me see.

122
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Dumplings.

123
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360
How is it?

124
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,510
What’s this? Why is there no meat?

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,750
Hua, you used to a fancy life.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You definitely don’t know about misery.

127
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,270
After Father ascended to the throne,

128
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,550
he replaced meat for the sacrifice
with coarse grains

129
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,120
to show sympathy for people’s suffering.

130
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,360
Count Cheng’an, it’s Hua’s first time.

131
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,240
Why didn’t you tell her in advance?

132
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,150
Your Highness.

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,440
It’s also my first time.

134
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,030
Sorry for my bad memory.

135
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,840
Your Highness, didn’t you
prepare fresh juice?

136
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,390
Right, come on.

137
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,200
Yes.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,960
Serve the juice.

139
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,910
Yes.

140
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,240
Please enjoy it.

141
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,790
Finally, there is something tasty.

142
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,150
Why so little juice?

143
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,630
Hua, why did you drink it up?

144
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,360
Cousin Zhang, it’s my

145
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,150
first time to have

146
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,670
such fresh juice.

147
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,630
I couldn’t help myself.

148
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,630
If you like it,

149
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,360
you can also drink mine.

150
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,390
Really?

151
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,840
It’s very kind of you. I’ll drink it.

152
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,120
Look at her!

153
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,720
Thank you.

154
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,270
I have a stomachache
and need to go to the washroom.

155
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,320
Sorry, Your Grace.

156
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,510
It’s okay.

157
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,240
It’s good that you are not hurt.

158
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,030
Hua.

159
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,480
Drink mine.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,720
Really?

161
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,630
I will be happy
as long as you are happy.

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
It’s very kind of you.

163
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,960
Hua.

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,630
Hua, what’s wrong?

165
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,790
Hua!

166
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,250
-Hua!
-Hua!

167
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,980
Hua!

168
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,390
Hua!

169
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,940
Come on, summon the physician!

170
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,850
Hua, what’s wrong with you?

171
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,940
-Summon the physician!
-Hua!

172
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,980
Hua!

173
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,900
Who is so bold

174
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,620
to use poison in the ceremony?

175
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,700
Hua.

176
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,780
Sir, how is Hua doing?

177
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,980
This poison is strange
and difficult to cure.

178
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,260
We have to use another poison

179
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,700
to force out the poisonous blood
as soon as possible.

180
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,900
Well...

181
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,300
Well...

182
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,020
Well...

183
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,900
Hua.

184
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,540
Hua!

185
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,780
Her Grace is unconscious.

186
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,100
She can’t take the medicine.

187
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,220
What should we do then?

188
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,900
Hua.

189
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,380
What to do, sir?

190
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,340
Yeah.

191
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,500
Is there any other way?

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,220
There is nothing I can do.

193
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,940
Let me do it.

194
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,660
This medicine is poisonous!
You can’t drink it!

195
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,580
Count Cheng’an!

196
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,860
-Hua!
-Hua!

197
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,140
This medicine is highly toxic!

198
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,860
You mustn’t drink anymore!

199
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,420
-Hua!
-Hua!

200
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,660
Hua! Hua!

201
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,780
You can’t have more!

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
Hua. Hua.

203
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,780
Hua...

204
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,900
Hua!

205
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,700
-Hua!
-Count Cheng’an!

206
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,060
-Physician!
-Hua!

207
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,220
Do something about it!

208
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,340
These two kids...!

209
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,100
Hua!

210
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,540
Rong Xia. Rong Xia.

211
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,940
Wake up. Rise and shine.

212
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,940
Rong Xia.

213
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,300
Hua, you’re awake.

214
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,860
You are fine now.

215
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,900
You saved me again.

216
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,100
As long as you are safe.

217
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,260
I’m willing to do anything for you.

218
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,540
Hua!

219
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,060
Mother.

220
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,860
Master! Master!

221
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,100
-Hua!
-Who woke up?

222
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,900
-Hua woke up!
-Who woke up?

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,300
Her Grace woke up!

224
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,260
Hua!

225
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,620
Hua, you must be hungry now.

226
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,780
-What do you want to eat?
-That’s great.

227
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,380
I’ll ask someone

228
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,860
to get whatever you want to eat.

229
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,100
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,780
Father.

231
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
Didn’t you say

232
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,060
they would serve meat and fish
in the ceremony?

233
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,140
Did you lie to me?

234
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,180
Yes, so what?

235
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,900
You only care about food.

236
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,980
I was going to find a wife for you.

237
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,780
But I didn’t expect you
to be so useless!

238
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,140
What’s wrong?

239
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,380
Let Physician Yu take a look first.

240
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,980
Come on, Physician Yu!

241
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,340
-Physician Yu, come on.
-Come on.

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,340
-Come on.
-Take a look at her.

243
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,700
How is she doing?

244
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,100
What’s the situation?

245
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,140
Physician Yu, how is she doing?

246
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,220
Master, madam.

247
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,260
Her Grace is doing fine now.

248
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,420
I need to observe for a few more days.

249
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,660
Okay. Okay.

250
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,860
Thank you. Thank you.

251
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,740
Thank you.

252
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,140
I’ll give you one more chance.

253
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,260
What did you see on the day
of the ceremony?

254
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,660
I won’t change my answer

255
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,700
no matter how many times you ask me.

256
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,780
You knew that cup of juice was poisonous

257
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,260
on the ceremony.

258
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,940
Get off me!

259
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,980
As my wife, how dare you not trust me?

260
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,060
They might not know it.

261
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,140
But I was sitting by your side.

262
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,500
I saw it clearly!

263
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,940
You are the one who put poison
in the Crown Prince’s juice!

264
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,060
Xie Wanyu.

265
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,980
I am being generous

266
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,700
to give you a chance again and again.

267
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,740
But you don’t cherish it.

268
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,940
You ask for your own destruction.

269
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,180
From today,

270
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,420
you are not allowed
to leave this room anymore!

271
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,380
Your Highness.

272
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,420
Princess Fule has woken up this morning.

273
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,620
You can rest assured.

274
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,220
Good.

275
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,620
Remember,

276
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,940
never let His Majesty know about it.

277
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,780
Yes.

278
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,100
What is so mysterious

279
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,700
that I can’t know?

280
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,740
What happened to Hua?

281
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,140
Say it.

282
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,580
Your Majesty.

283
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,780
Princess Fule was poisoned

284
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,540
during the farming sacrifice ceremony.

285
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,140
But she is awake now.

286
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,340
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

287
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,740
Poisoned?

288
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,220
How dare you hide
such a big thing from me!

289
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,900
I was wrong.

290
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,500
I’m just worried about your health...

291
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,220
Are you worried about my health

292
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,380
or that I will scold the Crown Prince?

293
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,260
Your Majesty, please calm down.

294
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,180
This is odd.
It’s definitely not Zhang’s fault.

295
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,660
Who else’s fault could it be?

296
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,100
He screwed up

297
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,460
every task I gave him!

298
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,820
It’s fine if Hua is all right.

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,620
If anything happens to her,

300
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,580
how should I explain to my aunt?

301
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,860
Send the best tonic in the Palace

302
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,500
to Ban’s mansion.

303
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,780
Yes.

304
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,180
Hurry up!

305
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,980
Saussurea involucrata.

306
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,660
Young Master Ban.

307
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,500
Cordyceps.

308
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,500
Blood ginseng.

309
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,580
Father, they are valuable.

310
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,220
May I know about

311
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,380
His Majesty’s intention?

312
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,740
After hearing that Her Grace feels ill,

313
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,900
His Majesty asked us to
send tonic in the Palace

314
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,780
to Her Grace for her health.

315
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,900
I appreciate His Majesty’s kindness.

316
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,220
It’s just when can we

317
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,580
finish all these tonic?

318
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,100
I will keep some of them.

319
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,220
Please bring the rest
back to the Palace.

320
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,140
Mr. Ban.

321
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,420
How can His Majesty withdraw his words?

322
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,740
If there are too many for you to eat,
then use them to cook chicken.

323
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,980
Use the rest of them to make tea.

324
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,500
If there are still any left,

325
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,220
put some saussurea involucrata
in the water when you take a bath.

326
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,980
Duke Jingting,

327
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,420
it’s up to you.

328
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,540
A saussurea involucrata bath?

329
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,260
Father, it’s such a waste.

330
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,380
In that case,

331
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,740
obedience is better than politeness.

332
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,340
Thank you very much.

333
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Come on, come on.

334
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,740
Come on.

335
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,780
Come on, let’s eat.

336
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,580
-Here.
-Have more.

337
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
The hot pot is still the best choice.

338
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,940
Give it to me.

339
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,500
I’ve been worried
and lost my appetite these days.

340
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,060
Hua, you know me the best.

341
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,340
Be careful. This isn’t a race.

342
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,540
I’ll ask someone to get more
for you if it’s not enough.

343
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,900
Ban Heng.

344
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,300
You are not young anymore.

345
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,060
You need to grow up a little bit.

346
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,420
You are going to take care of
our parents in the future.

347
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,340
Understand?

348
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,500
Hua, did the fever damage your brain?

349
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,940
You are too gentle.

350
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,660
I’m a little scared.

351
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,260
As a grown-up,
you actually burn yourself!

352
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,980
Such an idiot.

353
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,900
Do I have to say it out?

354
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,700
That’s who you are, Hua.

355
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,140
Our daughter made an

356
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,860
escape from death this time.
It’s worth celebrating.

357
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,100
Come on, cheers. Come on.

358
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,740
Come on.

359
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,580
Come on.

360
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,820
Let’s drink all we want today.

361
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,740
Good, come on.

362
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,020
Good wine!

363
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,540
Come on, have a drink.

364
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,260
-Drink slowly.
-Come on.

365
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,620
Okay. Madam, this is for you.

366
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,620
Come on, Count Rong.
Let’s drink together.

367
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,780
Come on.

368
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,460
I can’t detoxify the poison

369
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,060
left in your body.

370
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,140
It all depends on the fate

371
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,700
whether you can survive it or not.

372
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,540
Come on, let’s eat.

373
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,580
Rong Xia, I’m feeling
a little uncomfortable.

374
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,740
Can you take a walk with me?

375
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,460
I will always be with you

376
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,260
wherever you want to go.

377
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,420
Hua, why don’t you show it to me?

378
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,260
I’m not good at writing.

379
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,740
I won’t embarrass myself.

380
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Whatever you write

381
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,420
is always the best for me.

382
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,300
Show me yours first,

383
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,340
then I’ll tell you.

384
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,780

385
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,060
What about you?

386
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,580
Nice try.

387
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,940

398
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,260
Will it work?

399
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,820
As long as we are sincere,

400
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,740

I die one day...

406
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,340
Hua.

407
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,060
Don’t talk nonsense.

408
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,700
I’m just curious.

409
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,300
Actually, I also thought about it.

410
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,340
If something really
happens to you one day,

411
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,260
I will go with you.

412
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,900
We will meet in the afterworld.

413
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,820
We can skate and shoot arrows together.

414
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,700
I’ll teach you about zither, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

415
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,380
Don’t talk nonsense!

416
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,420
If I really die,

417
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,340
no one will care about you.

418
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,660
You must remember

419
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,420
to eat well and sleep on time.

420
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,980
You can resign if you don’t want to
be an official anymore.

421
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,780
Okay.

422
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,820
Go after whoever you like.

423
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,540
Marry her and teach her
to play the zither.

424
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,980
By the time,

425
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,420
I will watch in the sky
when you get married.

426
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,260
Hua.

427
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,140
Could you stop that?

428
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,540
Let’s talk about something else.

429
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,140
Look at this yard. How great it is.

430
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,700
I really want to give birth to a girl

431
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,180
and a boy for you.

432
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,020
By that time,

433
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,540
we can watch our children

434
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,500
play and roll on the ground.

435
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,460
You can

436
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,260
play the zither here.

437
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,260
I can put my head

438
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,220
against your shoulder quietly

439
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,900
and listen to the music you play.

440
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,740
Then you will praise me

441
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,500
for being the most beautiful woman
in your heart.

442
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,060
How wonderful

443
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,580
it will be to spend

444
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,860
the whole life with you.

445
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,860
You and I will grow old together
and have many children.

446
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,060
Hua! Hua!

447
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,860
Hua!

448
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,780
<i>May Rong Xia live a happy life

449
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,260
May Rong Xia live a happy life

450
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,180
and be with someone he loves.

451
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,780
A thorough investigation.

452
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
Again?

453
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,580
What else can you say
except these two words?

454
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,780
Father, please don’t be mad.

455
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,500
I will...

456
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,500
I will...

457
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,780
fully investigate this case.

458
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,020
What did you find?

459
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,780
My incompetence disappoints you.

460
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,660
That’s all you can say?

461
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,940
Look at yourself.

462
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,100
How should I explain to the Ban family?

463
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,020
Father.

464
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,060
I’m inadequate and indecisive.

465
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,620
I know I’m insufficient
to supervise the country.

466
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,620
Please allow me

467
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,980
to resign from the Supervisor of Daye.

468
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,980
I will fully investigate this case.

469
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,340
Zhang, what are you talking about?

470
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,940
Your Majesty, please calm down.

471
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,860
I should have realized

472
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,700
that you don’t have the talent
to rule the country.

473
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,260
It’s such

474
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,940
a waste of time and energy
to cultivate you.

475
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,980
Fine.

476
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,780
I will remove you

477
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,860
from the Supervisor of Daye.

478
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,660
<i>Ban’s Mansion</i>

479
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,900
Sir.

480
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,180
Didn’t you say that the poisoned
blood has been released?

481
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,460
Why does her condition worsen?

482
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,100
How deep is the hatred

483
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,820
between the poisoner and Her Grace?

484
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,020
He is ruthless indeed.

485
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,340
Hua.

486
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,700
I remember you once had a fever
when you were a kid.

487
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,260
I stayed by your side

488
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,580
for three days and nights
just like this.

489
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,980
Then you woke up by yourself.

490
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,260
You didn’t let me down.

491
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,380
I hope you won’t let me down today.

492
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,820
Just wake up, all right? Hua!

493
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,100
Master.

494
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,260
Wake up, Hua!

495
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,820
Master. Master.

496
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,060
Sir, is there any other way?

497
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,260
Find the poisoner
and ask for the antidote.

498
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,220
Maybe it can save Her Grace’s life.

499
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,140
I’ll go and get the antidote.

500
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,620
-Rong Xia!
-Count Rong!

501
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,980
Where are you going to get the antidote?

502
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,220
We both know

503
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,900
who dares to hurt Hua in Daye.

504
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,420
Count Rong.

505
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,140
You must be very careful.

506
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,020
Uncle, don’t worry.

507
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,180
I will get the antidote back for Hua.

508
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,060
Thank you, Count Rong.

509
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,900
What should we do?

510
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,380
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

511
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,420
Something happened to
Duke Jingting’s mansion!

512
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,780
What happened?

513
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,820
It’s Princess Fule.

514
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,220
The poison has attacked her.
No medicine can save her now.

515
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,540
She might not be able to make it!

516
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
Hua.

517
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,660
I

518
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,940
failed my aunt.

519
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,900
I failed Old General Ban.

520
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,900
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

521
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,340
Feixian?

522
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,860
Is that really you?

523
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,220
We haven’t met just for a few months,

524
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,100
but you are very haggard now.

525
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,140
I guess my sister didn’t tell you

526
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,140
that I’m back.

527
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,740
It’s great that you are back safely.

528
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,500
I’ve been worried

529
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,260
that something might
happen to you out there.

530
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,260
I’m not here today to renew our kinship,

531
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,420
but to give you a chance to
be exempt from punishment

532
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,460
and reinstated.

533
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,460
His Majesty won’t let me go easily.

534
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,900
His Majesty won’t survive tonight.

535
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,060
The person who will sit on the throne

536
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,700
will only be the Prince Luo.

537
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,580
What did you say? Prince Luo?

538
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,220
So, you and Prince Luo...

539
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,300
A word of mine can make

540
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,260
our family the most powerful one
in Daye.

541
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,500
And you can become a minister again.

542
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,460
That’s great.

543
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,700
That’s great.

544
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,260
It was all my fault.

545
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,660
I was wrong.

546
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,740
Since you know you were wrong,

547
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,060
then admit your mistake.

548
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,340
You will kneel down sooner or later.

549
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,820
You’d better get used to it earlier.

550
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,220
What did you say?

551
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,140
What did you say?

552
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,700
I’m your grandfather!

553
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,180
I...

554
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,020
When you abandoned me,

555
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,220
my relationship with
the Shi family was over.

556
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,420
<i>Wude Mansion</i>

557
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,740
Zhang resigned from
the position by himself.

558
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,940
He saved me from the efforts.

559
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,620
Congratulate Your Highness on having
the power to supervise the country.

560
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,780
Feixian.

561
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,140
You can take

562
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,060
half the credit.

563
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,660
I should love you more

564
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,140
from now on.

565
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,780
Your Highness.
Count Cheng’an presents himself.

566
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,660
Count Cheng’an is here as I expected.

567
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,580
Close the door! Hurry up!

568
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,620
-Okay.
-Come on.

569
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,860
Hua!

570
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,420
Light the candles!

571
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,820
There is light, there is life.

572
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,460
Hua, hang in there.

573
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,060
Rong Xia will be back soon
with the antidote.

574
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,820
There is light, there is life.

575
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,820
Don’t let the candles go out.

576
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,340
There is light, there is life.

577
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,500
I ask to see Prince Wude!

578
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,940
Count Rong,

579
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,420
nice to meet you.

580
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Where is Prince Luo?

581
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,740
His Highness is busy now.

582
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,140
I’ll entertain you for him.

583
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,540
Count Rong, please come in
and have some tea.

584
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,260
No need!

585
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,740
I’m here today

586
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,740
to ask for the antidote for Hua.

587
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,420
It’s not impossible to save Hua.

588
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,700
But I have two conditions.

589
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,140
Firstly,

590
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,540
break off your engagement

591
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,060
and stop seeing anyone
of the Ban family.

592
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,740
What about the second one?

593
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,700
Help Prince Wude

594
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,140
ascend to the throne.

595
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,300
What if

596
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,860
I don’t agree?

597
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,700
It will take nine days before
the poison attacks the heart.

598
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,700
This is the sixth day
since the ceremony.

599
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,060
For the rest of the days,

600
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,060
Count Rong,

601
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,820
you have to hurry up.

602
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,620
Rong Xia!

603
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,060
Hua is saved! Hua is saved.

604
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,420
Rong... Rong Xia.

605
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,380
Did you get the antidote?

606
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,540
I didn’t get the antidote.

607
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,720
Father!

608
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,660
-Master!
-Master!

609
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,620
Sorry.

610
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,820
Uncle, Aunt.

611
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,460
I’m incompetent.

612
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,420
Please forgive me.

613
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,580
We won’t blame you.

614
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,940
Maybe this is the fate of Hua.

615
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,740
We remember

616
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,220
what you have done for our Ban family.

617
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,660
Get up.

618
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,780
Get up.

619
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,780
Uncle, Aunt.

620
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,500
I want to...

621
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,340
Heng, be good.

622
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,940
Help your father back to his room.

623
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,970
-Help Master back to his room.
-Take care, Master.

624
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,500
Father.

625
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,100
Hua is deeply in love with you.

626
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,180
Spend more time talking to her.
