<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 29</i>

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,910
Your Highness,

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,430
if you have any problems,
you can go to Mr. Shi Jin.

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Mr. Shi is loyal to you.

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,590
You can trust him.

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,470
Your Grace is right.

41
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,840
But about this,

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,560
it’s embarrassing
to get Mr. Shi involved.

43
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,680
What a big issue is it

44
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,910
that Mr. Shi can’t get involved?

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
Since only families are here,

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,150
I’m just getting straight to the point.

47
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,400
Luo brought Shi Feixian
back to his mansion directly.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,470
Is it true?

49
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,560
Do Her Highness and His Majesty know?

50
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,280
Father feels not so well now.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,840
It’s better not to worry him.

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,520
Zhang, you’re always like this.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
You become so hesitant

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,190
as long as you’re facing
with Prince Luo’s issues.

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,030
It’s clear that he’s the person who sent
assassins to kill His Grace earlier.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,870
But you covered for him and

57
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,470
blamed it to Prime Minister Yan’s men.

58
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,190
Princess Ban,

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,430
it can’t be judged merely
by your verbal statement.

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,150
If you have any proof,

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,710
please ask the Court of Judicial Review
to investigate it.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,280
Otherwise, please watch your mouth,

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,870
not to destroy the harmony.

64
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,360
Crown Princess,

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,030
are you indulging Prince Luo?

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,150
Jiang Luo even tried to kill His Grace.

67
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,840
He may get worse later.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,630
Hua, you’re worrying too much.

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,800
Though Luo is impulsive,

70
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,310
he’s not a bad man.

71
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,120
I just want to remind you here.

72
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,680
You’re indulging Prince Luo,

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,150
but he won’t thank you for that.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
It’s you!

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,870
What did I do?

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,630
Don’t put on an act here!

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,430
I’m in this situation now.

78
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,360
Are you happy?

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,120
You gave me so many contraceptive herbs.

80
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,390
Are you satisfied

81
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,870
with my thank-you gift, Mr. Xie?

82
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,000
Shi Feixian,

83
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,870
aren’t you afraid I’ll kill you
since you keep me alive?

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,510
The injured people

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,830
are better to be peaceful.

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,000
Well.

87
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,750
I’m coming to tell you

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,430
Crown Prince sent a troop last night.

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Your Fude House

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,800
has been a history.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,160
His Highness has a weak character.

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,950
How could he do this?

93
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,000
His Highness couldn’t do it.

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,830
But Count Cheng’an could.

95
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,040
Now you have only two options.

96
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,390
You can choose to assist

97
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,000
Prince Luo to ascend the thrown with me,

98
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,680
or choose to perish together with me.

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,270
Whatever your choice is,

100
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,630
I shall take on you to the end.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,190
Why are you here?

102
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,240
Wanyu.

103
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,360
His Highness is worrying
about his injury,

104
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,120
so he especially asked me to come.

105
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
I will take care of my brother.

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,750
You don’t need to come.

107
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,190
Take good care of Mr. Xie then.

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,510
His Highness is so worrying
about his injury.

109
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,870
If he is really worried,

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,510
why doesn’t he come in person?

111
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,360
Why call her to put on the act?

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,720
Here. Chongjin.

113
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,160
You’re prince’s wife.

114
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,680
How can you stay so long
in your parents’ home?

115
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,040
I’ll ask someone to escort you back.

116
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,480
He doesn’t like me at all.

117
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,870
What do I go back for?

118
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,160
Go back now.

119
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,160
Apologize to Prince Luo.

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,390
Beg him to keep you in his mansion!

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,270
Shi Feixian is living
in his mansion now.

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,510
Do you still want me to beg him?

123
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,480
Wanyu!

124
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,240
I’m useless now.

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
If you are also abandoned,

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,800
who else can the Xies rely on?

127
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,800
Wanyu.

128
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,920
Father is getting old now.

129
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,390
He’s going to retire soon.

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,390
Qilin is blind.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
He can’t be an official for this life.

132
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,870
And I…

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
I am a disabled man

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,680
who can’t even have a child.

135
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,190
Do you really want to see

136
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,000
Xie family declining

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,160
and being a joke?

138
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,830
I…

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
Now Xie family

140
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,510
can only rely on you.

141
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,780
<i>Qingyu House</i>

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
Hua, Count Cheng’an.

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,630
His Majesty is really generous
this time.

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,630
Thanks to His Grace.

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,920
Go.

146
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,820
<i>Qingyu House</i>

147
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,120
Look at that. Look. Look.

148
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,000
It’s so beautiful!

149
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,600
So His Majesty cares about Hua so much.

150
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,040
He plants Hua’s favorite peonies.

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,120
Your Grace,

152
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,430
when Huahua moves in,

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,630
you can draw more pictures for it.

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,360
What name do you think

155
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,550
we can call this house?

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,300
<i>Bai</i>

157
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,060
<i>Baishou House</i>

158
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
<i>Baishou House</i>
Baishou House.

159
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,080
What does it mean?

160
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,030
It’s called Baishou House.

161
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,670
Hope I can live together with you

162
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,840
till an old age.

163
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,870
Here. Put a bet!

164
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,390
Half chance!

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,790
Win as much as you bet!

166
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,150
Pay you as much as you bet!

167
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,440
Come on! Put a bet!

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,120
Put down!

169
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,150
Put!

170
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,550
It’s such a surprise that

171
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,150
Princess Ban and Count Cheng’an
are really getting married!

172
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,600
I wonder it’s Princess Ban’s luck

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
or Count Cheng’an’s luck.

174
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,900
Red color represents the Bans and Rongs
will tie the knot.

175
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,500
The black one means they won’t.

176
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,300
Come on. Put a bet!

177
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,220
Young Master Ban,

178
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,140
have you bet on it?

179
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Certainly.

180
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,820
I bet on the black one.

181
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,620
You really have the heart to bet that.

182
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,020
-Yeah.
-What do you know?

183
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,980
I never win a bet.

184
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,820
So the black one means

185
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,940
my sister will get married smoothly.

186
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,260
I bet on the red one.

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,380
Change it.

188
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,620
I’ve got some business. I’m going.

189
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,340
You can keep playing. Bye.

190
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,540
-Bye.
-Don’t leave.

191
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,580
When I saw you last time,

192
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,380
you were fancy like a peacock.

193
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,260
Why are you like
a roasted chicken today?

194
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,740
What? Prince Luo abused you?

195
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,260
I’m not in good mood today.

196
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,140
I don’t want to argue with you.

197
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,100
I see.

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,940
Does your sister betray you

199
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,100
and take your Prince Wude?

200
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,940
Ban Heng, have you done?

201
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,260
Or do you feel annoyed

202
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,020
because you haven’t cooked for long?

203
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,460
Do you know

204
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,740
where I can get

205
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,620
some nice almond shortcakes in the city?

206
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,060
Almond shortcakes?

207
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,140
When I’m in bad mood,

208
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,340
I’d like to eat almond shortcakes.

209
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,020
But today I’ve hunted

210
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,340
the cake shops all over the city.

211
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
They are either too sweet or too dry.

212
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,220
Almond shortcakes…

213
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
Actually,

214
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,900
if you can make cakes,

215
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,900
I can lend you the kitchen in my home.

216
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,820
Really?

217
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,820
But in one condition,

218
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,100
that is,

219
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,900
you must allow me to have a taste.

220
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,460
It’s done.

221
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,220
Come on. Have a taste.

222
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,180
Taste it.

223
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,700
It’s hot.

224
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,780
What do you think?

225
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,180
Good.

226
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,180
Xie Wanyu.

227
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,580
I can’t believe that your cook skills
are so good.

228
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,940
I will also find a wife

229
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,900
who can cook well.

230
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,260
There are few girls
who can cook in the city.

231
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Indeed.

232
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,900
It’s a pity that you’re prince’s wife.

233
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,780
I can’t…

234
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,660
I mean,

235
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
you’re prince’s wife. You can’t cook.

236
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,540
What’re you thinking?

237
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
What’re you thinking?

238
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,780
Whoever you want to marry
is none of my business.

239
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,260
It has nothing to do with you

240
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,460
that who I want to marry.

241
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,660
I can marry anyone.

242
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,140
Why are you worrying so much?

243
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,140
It’s more than my sister does.

244
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,900
Let me tell you.

245
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,180
Since childhood, my sister

246
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,980
has been so good at boasting herself.

247
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,780
Who are you bad-mouthing?

248
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,620
Hua. Hua.

249
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,260
Oh, good.

250
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,900
He praises your cooking every day.

251
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,060
I happen to need your favor.

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,900
<i>Chef Selection of Ban’s Mansion</i>
Chef selection of Ban’s mansion

254
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,540
is beginning now.

255
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,300
You two can leave first.

256
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,540
You haven’t tasted yet.

257
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,700
How come you just ask them to leave?

258
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,420
A good dish should be a perfect
combination of color, aroma and taste.

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,420
Those two are too ugly.

260
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,380
No need to taste them.

261
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,300
You can leave, too.

262
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,460
You three’s specialties

263
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,700
are in different styles.

264
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,540
It’s hard

265
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,300
to judge them now.

266
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
You. You’re eliminated.

267
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,220
Why?

268
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
You’re easy to sweat. It’s unhygienic.

269
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,340
Go. Go. Go.

270
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,700
Congratulations, you two.

271
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,780
You can throw your dishes away now.

272
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
They’ve left.

273
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,060
Why are you still here?

274
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,700
It’s such a good dish.

275
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,820
What a pity to throw it away!

276
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,220
The person who cherishes ingredients
and knows what a good dish is

277
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
is a good chef.

278
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,940
Princess Ban, it’s her.

279
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,820
<i>Celebratory Bedding and Clothing</i>

280
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,860
Are there some high-quality quilts
in this shop?

281
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,540
My princess is finally getting married.

282
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,700
We should choose the best ones.

283
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,780
You can rest assured.

284
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,580
I’ve found someone

285
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,860
to ask around before we come.

286
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,140
It’s the best shop

287
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,420
in the city, even in the country.

288
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,700
Really?

289
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,940
Let’s go.

290
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,260
<i>Celebratory Bedding and Clothing</i>

291
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,580
Are you choosing quilts for wedding?

292
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,860
-Exactly!
-Exactly!

293
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,580
Not for us.

294
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,420
It’s for my young master and her lady.

295
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,420
Do you need me to introduce for you?

296
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,100
No. We can pick.

297
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
Okay. Take your time then.

298
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,180
I’m available at any time.

299
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,260
This one is good.

300
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,140
My young master likes quiet colors.

301
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,500
But my princess likes those beautiful

302
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,380
and big ones.

303
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,100
Why do you need it to be so big?

304
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Princess kicks her quilt off a lot.

305
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,780
I think she kicks people a lot.

306
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,140
What do you mean?

307
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,300
What do you mean?

308
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,020
What do you…?

309
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,620
It is improper for men and women
to touch each other.

310
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,620
Do you think you are qualified?

311
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,380

315
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,700
Anle, why are you here?

316
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,860
I heard that you’re getting married.

317
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
You didn’t tell me.

318
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,020
So I have to come here myself.

319
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,060
Don’t play joke on me.

320
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,540
But when will you remarry?

321
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,780
So many people are adoring me.

322
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,260
I can’t decide whom I’ll marry with
in a short time.

323
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
There’s no time.

324
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,100
I’m here to bring you to my mansion.

325
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,980
I haven’t met Hua for long.

326
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,940
Now I’m bringing her to my mansion
to have a chat.

327
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,020
Would you mind it, Count Cheng’an?

328
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,980
I dare not reject
Your Highness’s invitation.

329
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,540
But it’s getting dark early in spring.

330
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,580
I hope Your Highness can consider that.

331
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,820
Rest assured.

332
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,260
I’ll definitely send Hua

333
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,740
back to you safely.

334
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,180
Anle,

335
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,020
why do you take me to
your princess’s mansion?

336
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,220
Silly girl. You’re getting married.

337
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,740
There’ll be no chance to go crazy. Go.

338
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,180
What’re you going to do?

339
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,180
Young Master,

340
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Princess Ban has really gone
to Princess Anle’s mansion.

341
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,780
Hua and Her Highness
haven’t met for long.

342
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,340
They must have a lot to talk about.

343
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,700
But I heard that

344
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,100
Princess Anle

345
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,060
called all her followers to the mansion.

346
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,940
Be careful not to get cold,
Young Master.

347
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,860
This…

348
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
This is the happy single banquet

349
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,940
I prepare for you specially.

350
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,260
They are all thoroughly accomplished
in lyre-playing, and painting.

351
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,420
You can choose whatever you want

352
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,660
to listen and watch today.

353
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,780
It’s… It’s hard to choose.

354
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,900
You’re right.

355
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,660
How about I introduce

356
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,940
two young men to you?

357
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,460
This one is Mr. Zhang.

358
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,380
You’ll not be bored

359
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,540
by his face, even for a hundred years.

360
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,580
To be honest,

361
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,180
it can be compared
with that of Count Cheng’an, can’t it?

362
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,380
This girl…

363
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,700
This is Mr. Wang.

364
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,700
A man?

365
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,300
You two must can get along well.

366
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,900
He’s a famous singer in the city.

367
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,100
If you want to listen to any operas,

368
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,180
you can ask him to sing it for you.

<i>Rong’an Mansion</i>
Your Grace.

371
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,300
If you don’t know which one to choose,

372
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,540
how about you show yourselves to her?

373
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

374
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,180
We will take good care of Her Grace!

375
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,660
Rest assured.

376
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,780
Don’t. Anle.

377
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,060
I’ve been engaged.

378
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,340
Your Grace.

379
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,340
Sir, do you have anything to talk?

380
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,460
Why are you getting so close to me?

381
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,380
If I remember it right,

382
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,420
I didn’t invite you to come today.

383
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,660
Your Highness, sorry for the rudeness.

384
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,540
I happened to pass by.

385
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,740
I notice the trees are in blossom,

386
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
so I decided to come in
to enjoy the scenery.

387
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,340
Enjoy the scenery?

388
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,020
Then why are you holding two
buckets of water?

389
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,660
You’ve misunderstood me, Your Highness.

390
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,420
I saw that they were getting close.

391
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,860
I thought they were up to no good.

392
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,020
So I drove them away with water.

393
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Hua, I take you back to change.

394
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,140
It’s not convenient today.

395
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,220
I’ll come another day.

396
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,900
Come again?

397
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,660
Go.

398
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
How can you go back
with your wet clothes?

399
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,700
Do you think I’m lack

400
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,900
of clothes in my mansion?

401
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,220
If Hua wears your clothes,

402
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,740
I’m afraid it’s an arrogation crime.

403
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,300
It’s my mansion.

404
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,500
I have the final say.

405
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,420
He’s right.

406
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,820
As Ban’s Mansion is not far away,
I don’t want to bother you.

407
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,700
Silly girl, don’t talk.

408
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,100
I’m helping you.

409
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,660
Helping me?

410
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,580
Don’t you want to see

411
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,180
Count Cheng’an being jealous?

412
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,620
Hua, let’s go.

413
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,380
Actually it’s okay

414
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,820
to change clothes here.

415
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,020
Yes.

416
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,260
I have not only many
beautiful clothes here,

417
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,140
but someone to serve Hua to get changed.

418
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,980
I will serve her.

419
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,780
No. I will.

420
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,620
-I will serve her.
-I will. I will.

421
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,380
No need.

422
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,660
Her Grace is only used
to the customized green tea soaps.

423
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
She is uncomfortable outside.

424
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
It’s better to go back.

425
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,860
It’s also good
to change the flavors occasionally.

426
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,220
Hua.

427
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,820
No one here knows
the water temperature Hua uses.

428
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,140
What if she gets cold?

429
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,700
What if she’s burned?

430
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,340
You keep saying no to my offers.

431
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,260
Are you going to bathe her yourself

432
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,420
when Hua goes home?

433
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,500
Anle, what’re you talking about?

434
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,460
Your Highness, the joke goes too far.

435
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,860
We are famous for our gentleness.

436
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,700
Your Grace can just enjoy.

437
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,980
Yeah. We’re so gentle.

438
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,500
If Count Cheng’an doesn’t
want to bathe Hua,

439
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,380
I have many people here
who’re willing to do it.

440
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,740
I’ll bathe her!

441
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,900
A word uttered cannot be taken back.

442
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,820
Don’t go back on your words,
Count Cheng’an.

443
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,900
Go back.

444
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,900
Your Grace,

445
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,420
what’s wrong?

446
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,060
It’s only been two days.

447
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,220
You have planted so many flowers.

448
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,900
So amazing.

449
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,100
I won’t have you bathe me.

450
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,580
Don’t be shy, Your Grace.

451
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,380
After drying yourself,

452
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
just go back to your room.

453
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,260
Are you still jealous?

454
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,820
Open the door first.

455
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,820
We can talk about it.

456
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,380
You poured me water.

457
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,740
I haven’t blamed you for that.

458
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
Now are you mad at me first?

459
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,900
Come out or not?

460
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,140
I will tell my father and

461
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,620
ask him to kick your ass.

462
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,540
I’m wrong.

463
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,580
I will admit my mistakes

464
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,900
to Duke Jingting someday.

465
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,860
You…!

466
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,020
You can just stay inside for your life!

467
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,220
Once I think of

468
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,220
the powerful chest

469
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,020
of Mr. Qin,

470
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,660
I feel safe.

471
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,340
How about I borrow him from Anle

472
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,620
and ask him to be my bodyguard?

473
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,780
Don’t you dare!

474
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,620
I never know

475
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,580
you’re a jealous man.

476
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,620
I’m a gentleman

477
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,620
who takes country development
as my responsibility.

478
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,660
How will I be jealous
of those followers?

479
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,860
Alright. It’s my mistake.

480
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,980
I didn’t intend to go there.

481
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,140
After all, all men in the world

482
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,260
can’t be compared with you.

483
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,060
Is it right?

484
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,500
Is it right?

485
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,100
Look at me.

486
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
I promise.

487
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,980
Even if

488
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,420
there are a thousand handsome men
in front of me,

489
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,140
I won’t see them. Really.

490
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,700
If they force me to see,

491
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
I’ll blind myself

492
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,660
to keep your purity.

493
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,300
If all people in the world

494
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,220
are so good at talking like you,

495
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,860
the Court of Judicial Review may
find it hard to settle a lawsuit.

496
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,500
The peonies are so beautiful.

497
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,700
What to do if they wither?

498
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
They may get ugly.

499
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,620
When we move in after getting married,

500
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,220
we’ll live here together forever.

501
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,220
There’ll surely be the blossom time.

502
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,020
By then,

503
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,460
I hope

504
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,340
I can be carefree like now.

505
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,860
Your Grace, you can chop
firewood over there.

506
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,380
And I can primp myself in the room.

507
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,100
If you are drawing pictures,

508
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,100
I can play the Qin

509
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,900
by your side.

510
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,740
What do you mean?

511
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,380
I…

512
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,140
Are you saying
that I can’t play it well?

513
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,580
No. Not at all.

514
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,900
I think that as you still miss
beautiful tunes.

515
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,180
I’m so pleased.

516
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,020
Well.

517
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,420
Between that I play swords

518
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,140
and I play the Qin,

519
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,420
what will you choose?

520
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,580
Play swords then.

521
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,940
It must be so pleasant
to see you play swords here.

522
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,540
Look at you.

523
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,300
You’re saying I can’t play the Qin well.

524
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,860
Hua, listen to me.

525
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,620
I didn’t mean that.

526
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,460
I mean, you…

527
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,100
You don’t deserve the Qin.

528
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,780
Hua, I didn’t mean that.

529
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,580
I… Hua. Hua.

530
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,140
<i>Shen Nong’s Herbal Classic</i>

531
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,460
Miss, I’ve served the soup

532
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,580
to Miss Wanyu.

533
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,300
Change clothes for me then.

534
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,460
If it’s late,

535
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,100
the soup will be cold.

536
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,900
Yes.

537
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,700
Are you afraid?

538
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,380
Don’t drink that!

539
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,500
What do you mean?

540
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,380
The soup is mine. You can’t drink it.

541
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,740
How precious is your soup?

542
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,820
You can drink it,

543
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,020
why can’t Miss Wanyu?

544
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,100
Shi Feixian, what’s your problem?

545
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,660
Let’s talk it through today.

546
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,100
You’ve misunderstood me.

547
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,620
But the soup…

548
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,540
The Huanhua herb!

549
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,620
Isn’t it a kind of contraceptive herb?

550
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,260
Miss, she’s hurting you purposely!

551
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,260
Nonsense!

552
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,540
It’s for my lady herself!

553
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,900
Stop talking!

554
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,460
Why are you doing it?

555
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,620
I’ve felt sorry for you
that I’ve been His Highness’s concubine.

556
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,260
If I give birth to His Highness’s child,

557
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,460
it’ll be a bigger harm to you.

558
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,260
What’s done is done.

559
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,220
What do you want

560
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,740
by telling me these?

561
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,300
I want nothing.

562
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,660
I only want you to know

563
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,900
I’m missing you all the time

564
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,260
and missing those years when

565
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,660
we were having fun in the forest and

566
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,060
when I taught you to draw a fish tail.

567
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,860
Today

568
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,300
I bring you the shortcakes I made.

569
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,380
Almond shortcakes.

570
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,100
I know you have a fancy

571
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,180
to almond flavor.

572
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,340
Do you remember that there’s a time

573
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,060
when you had three shortcakes at a time,

574
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,020
and I gave you mine

575
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,260
to bring back.

576
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,260
No, I don’t.

577
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,060
It makes sense.

578
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,060
Now you’re

579
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,260
a noble wife of the prince,

580
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,260
but I’m just a criminal

581
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,740
who can’t either go home
or visit others.

582
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,260
If you like it,

583
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,900
just taste my shortcakes I made for you.

584
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,820
I’m leaving first.

585
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,180
Don’t…

586
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,980
Miss,

587
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,620
are you going to forgive her like that?

588
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,780
I also feel sad

589
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,100
when seeing her in this situation.

590
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,580
But, as long as I’m prince’s wife,

591
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,860
I can’t get along well with her.

592
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,660
But aren’t you going to divorce?

593
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,540
But Chongjin…!

594
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,740
If I divorce now,

595
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,300
the Xie family will have no hope.

596
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,140
Bad things keep happening
to my brothers.

597
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,060
I can’t be so selfish.

598
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,220
I should think for the Xie family.

599
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,660
Miss, what’s wrong?

600
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,380
The almond cakes are so good.

601
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,860
I feel more anxious now.

602
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,660
Mother asks to see us today.

603
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,220
If you dare to talk

604
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,380
about divorce in front of Mother,

605
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
or mention Shi Feixian,

606
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,660
I will not spare you.

607
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,500
Rest assured. I’m not that stupid.

608
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,700
Smile.

609
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,820
-Greetings to you, Mother!
-Greetings to you, Mother!

610
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,780
Mother, I’ve been busy lately,

611
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,140
and haven’t come to greet you a lot.

612
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,420
Please forgive me.

613
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,500
Mother,

614
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
I’ve prepared this specialty from south

615
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,060
for you.

616
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,900
Wish you can be healthy

617
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,780
and happy forever.

618
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,460
Don’t be angry, Mother.

619
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,980
I don’t know what I did wrong.

620
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,540
Please tell me.

621
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,380
I will correct it.

622
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,300
You are a prince’s wife.

623
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,100
But you let the harem be in such a mess.

624
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,380
Where’s the decency?

625
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,220
Mother.

626
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,180
I have only Wanyu in my harem.

627
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,700
How can it be a mess?

628
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,820
You brought a girl back from outside.

629
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,540
You think

630
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,420
I don’t know it at all?

631
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,540
You’ve been married for long

632
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,340
but have no child.

633
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,020
You’re a second son.

634
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,340
If you still have no child,

635
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,620
your father may

636
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,540
send you to a fief now.

637
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,980
I know.

638
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,260
You are a legal prince’s wife.

639
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,260
Though your husband has concubines,

640
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,900
you will never

641
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,540
lose your control over anyone.

642
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,660
So

643
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,340
you can just relax

644
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,100
and give birth to a noble child.

645
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,180
As to the others,

646
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,580
I will deal with them for you.

647
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,780
Thanks, Mother.

648
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,340
Luo,

649
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,260
your brother and Crown Princess
are such an affectionate couple.

650
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,060
How can’t you

651
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,900
learn from your brother?

652
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,740
Mother,

653
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,580
I have something else to do.

654
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,340
I’ll leave you to rest then.

655
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,180
You…

656
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,460
I’m leaving now.

657
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,780
Chongjin!

658
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,820
Chongjin! Chongjin!

659
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,300
Your wound hasn’t healed. Don’t move.

660
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,620
Son, why are you up?

661
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,780
Qilin, help your brother
go back to his bed.

662
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,580
Leave me alone.

663
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,140
Chongjin!

664
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,180
Chongjin, health is the most important.

665
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,860
Don’t pretend to be strong.

666
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,740
Mother is right.

667
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,540
If you are hurt again,

668
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,580
it’s no use however high rank you’re in.

669
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,100
I must see Prince Luo.

670
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,940
Chongjin!

671
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,380
Prince Luo. Prince Luo.

672
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,740
You could lose your life.

673
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,180
How can you see Prince Luo?

674
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,540
If we knew it would be so dangerous
to work for him,

675
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,460
you shouldn’t have done it.

676
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,020
Now we can satisfy ourselves

677
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,580
with enough food and money,

678
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,260
there’s no need for you
to work hard, son.

679
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,500
Darling.

680
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,340
Father,

681
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,580
your words

682
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,100
are beyond my expectation.

683
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,540
But I can’t leave the bad situation

684
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,780
to Wanyu alone.

685
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,860
Father.

686
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,300
Let me go.

687
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,010
Chongjin!

688
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,040
-Chongjin!
-Chongjin!

689
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,660
Chongjin!

690
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,430
Chongjin!

691
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,060
They said only methods
of governing the country before.

692
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,820
Now they even ask me to learn

693
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,380
private issues from him.

694
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,100
Your Highness.

695
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,180
Feixian.

696
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,940
You got scolded by Mother a lot before.

697
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,820
But I’ve never seen you
being so anxious.

698
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,660
There must be other things
that annoy you.

699
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,300
Feixian.

700
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,140
I can never hide from you.

701
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,940
Mother said, when Jiang Zhang
ascends to the throne

702
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,620
and I have no kid,

703
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,020
Father will send me to a fief.

704
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,940
You are suffering the grievance for me.

705
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,100
I feel so sorry.

706
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I’d better leave tomorrow.

707
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,220
I don’t allow that.

708
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,860
If I can’t even protect the girl I love,

709
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,300
how can I still be a prince?

710
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,380
I’m not worth it.

711
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,260
Don’t feel inferior.

712
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,780
Xie Wanyu is unqualified

713
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,980
to have my child.

714
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,900
I have only you in my heart.

715
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,180
Your Highness.

716
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,140
But

717
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,220
if you don’t want to sleep with Wanyu,

718
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,900
there’s only one way to go.

719
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,180
Stop Crown Prince ascending the throne.

720
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,900
That’s exactly what I’m thinking.

721
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,420
You’re so smart and considerate.

722
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,860
How can I not love you?

723
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,300
But it’s a pity that

724
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,460
Xie Chongjin is injured now.

725
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,900
I have no one to discuss with.

726
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,460
I’m coming.

727
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,700
Xie Chongjin, how’s your injury?

728
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,780
Though Mr. Xie is injured,

729
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,100
he won’t delay discussing
the big issue with Your Highness.

730
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,220
With such a loyal counselor,

731
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,620
Your Highness should cherish that.

732
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,100
I’m willing to work for Your Highness

733
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,540
till my death.

734
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,740
Great.

735
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,380
Good.
You have lived up to my expectation.

736
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,780
Your Highness,

737
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,620
I have an idea

738
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,540
to help you ascend the throne.

739
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,660
I don’t know if you dare to do that.

740
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,740
This is the colored-glaze hairpins
from the west.

741
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,220
Hua, this is for you.

742
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,580
Rong Xia, that’s Shan Ke’s
legendary painting tools.

743
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,020
You can take them back.

744
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,100
Your Highness, just cut the crap

745
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,940
and speak it out.

746
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,660
Days ago, it’s indeed Jiang Luo
who assaulted you.

747
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,580
I’m sorry for that.

748
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,820
Please forgive me.

749
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,220
I accept your apology.

750
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,220
But I want to say something, too.

751
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,260
You covered up for him this time.

752
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,740
But if he doesn’t correct himself

753
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,620
and serves the devil again.

754
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,660
It may be a big trouble.

755
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,180
Hua.

756
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,700
It doesn’t matter.

757
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,060
Now the Farming Festival is coming.

758
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,260
Father doesn’t feel well this year,

759
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,220
and entrusts me this major task.

760
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,620
Luo has always

761
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,660
showed no interest
in sacrificial activities.

762
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,300
Yet this year

763
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,820
he offers to help
with preparing it a lot.

764
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,980
Last night, Suyue reminded me that

765
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,140
maybe Luo

766
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,380
is plotting something again.

767
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,780
The sacrificial activity
is a big affair.

768
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,820
If he does something bad
in the sacrifice,

769
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,340
Your Highness’s fame must be damaged.

770
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,100
Prince Luo wants that to happen exactly.

771
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,740
It’s understandable
that you’re worrying.

772
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,060
Princess Royal’s birthday banquet

773
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,620
almost triggered a court fight.

774
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,340
If the Farming Festival can’t go well,

775
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,500
I… I’d feel ashamed to see Father.

776
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Are you asking for help, Your Majesty?

777
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,300
I hope Hua and Count Cheng’an can

778
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,460
attend the sacrifice in the Festival.

779
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,340
Attend the sacrifice?

780
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,300
Aren’t only married people

781
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,820
allowed to attend?

782
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,540
Don’t worry.

783
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,740
Father has written an edict.

784
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,140
From now on,

785
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,620
you’ve been

786
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,420
the legal husband and wife
approved by His Majesty.
