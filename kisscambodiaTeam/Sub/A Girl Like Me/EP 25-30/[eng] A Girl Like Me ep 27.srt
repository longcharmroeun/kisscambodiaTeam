<i>A Girl Like Me</i>

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>Episode 27</i>

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,070
Young Master.

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,750
This is a letter from Crown Prince.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
It’s supposed to be the findings.

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,520
According to our informer,

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
people in Wude Palace
did go in and out of the courtyard.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,150
Xie Chongjin didn’t cheat us.

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,590
The evidence is solid.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Then we can tell Crown Prince

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,000
<i>According to the investigation,</i>
about Prince Luo’s hiding

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,910
<i>those who tried to kill Count Cheng’an</i>
of Shi Feixian.

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,980
<i>are remnants of Prime Minister Yan.
Please don’t doubt Luo.</i>

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
Not now.

48
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,030
According to the investigation,

49
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,280
those who tried to kill Count Cheng’an

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,190
are remnants of Prime Minister Yan.

51
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,750
They are just fall guys.

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,630
Crown Prince is tender by nature.

53
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,080
He’ll consider their brotherhood.

54
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,360
It’s hard for him to get the truth

55
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,030
about things related to Prince Luo.

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,840
Crown Prince is supervising now.

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,190
It can’t work without his permission.

58
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,430
One person is more worried

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
about Shi Feixian’s location.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Commander Shi Jin.

61
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,800
You don’t tell His Majesty

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,870
but the Shi people about

63
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,870
Shi Feixian’s return.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,960
This is our best chance

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,470
to fight against Prince Luo.

66
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,030
It’s a pity

67
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,910
to do so.

68
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,590
If Commander Shi knows she is back,

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,630
he won’t stand by.

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,520
Shi Feixian is the one causing barrier

71
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,280
between Prince Luo and Xie Chongjin.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,870
If she is alive,

73
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,560
Xie Chongjin will always

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,030
keep things reserved.

75
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,750
Prince Luo won’t completely trust

76
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,590
Xie Chongjin at the same time.

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120
So Shi Feixian is the best choice

78
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,240
to balance them in their battle.

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,190
If she is killed,

80
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,800
Prince Luo will do things
out of control.

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
It won’t be good to anyone.

82
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,590
The medicine is ready.

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,560
Please take it.

84
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,630
Feixian.

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,560
Jin.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,950
Since you’ve been back,

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
why didn’t you tell me?

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
Why didn’t you go home?

89
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,270
Wait. It’s very dangerous here.

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,600
We can’t let anybody know

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,480
you are back.

92
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,830
Don’t worry anyway.

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,310
I will find you

94
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,510
a safe place.

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Feixian.

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
From the day I was banished,

97
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,720
your words now

98
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,600
has been too late.

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Feixian, listen to me.

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
I promise

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,000
I will keep you safe from now on.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
I won’t let anybody hurt you.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
I don’t need it.

104
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,070
Grandfather chose to give me up.

105
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,870
I can also have my choice.

106
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,120
I’ll never enter the Shi’s anymore.

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,720
Never?

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,270
So will you depend on Jiang Luo?

109
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,950
It’s hard to live alone.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,040
Without Jiang Luo,

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,510
I won’t have a place to stay, will I?

112
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,040
Prince Luo is scheming and cruel.

113
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,430
If anything happens to him one day,

114
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,950
he won’t care about you.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,870
He won’t?

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
You think the Shi family will?

117
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,950
The Shi family chose the wrong side.

118
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,390
Crown Prince is so timid.

119
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,040
Jin.

120
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,190
Do you really think he can succeed?

121
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,680
Feixian, watch your mouth.

122
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,120
If you need,

123
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
I can help you

124
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,830
say something good to Prince Luo.

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,510
That will surely get you promoted.

126
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,310
Only if you are well,

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,310
I don’t care about honor and rank.

128
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,070
Please leave.

129
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,510
I won’t go with you.

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,430
If you

131
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,430
really feel sorry to me,

132
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,390
I’d like to see Suyue.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,310
What?

134
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
All my words are true.

135
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,270
Luckily, Miss Shi didn’t accept that,

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,360
and still lives in the courtyard.

137
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,070
Who told Shi Jin that?

138
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
I have no idea.

139
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,680
Get out. I’m unhappy now.

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I have a word with you.

141
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,800
Didn’t you hear me? Get out!

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,120
I will go if you agree about my request.

143
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
I want to divorce you.

144
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,720
Divorce?

145
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,070
Only I can divorce you.

146
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,630
It’s not up to you to divorce me.

147
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,000
If you don’t agree,

148
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,950
I will ask the Empress for help.

149
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,830
How dare you!

150
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,800
Let go of me!

151
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,000
Someone!

152
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,070
Lock her up!

153
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,190
Never let her leave

154
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,920
without my order!

155
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes!

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,920
You are still useful.

157
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,480
How can I let you go?

158
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,310
Take her away.

159
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,560
Let go of me!

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
No incense ashes.

161
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,510
No acupuncture.

162
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,160
We’ve tried every way,

163
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,360
but she just isn’t awake.

164
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,000
So

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
this is also the wrong way.

166
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,070
She doesn’t care about it at all.

167
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,750
Besides Count Cheng’an,

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,750
what else does she care about?

169
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,910
Here you are.

170
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,550
Oh yes, the clothes.

171
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,360
What? What clothes?

172
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,550
Here you are.

173
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,550
Uncle.

174
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,480
Your Grace.

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Thank you for your hard work.

176
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,910
You may go back for a rest first.

177
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,320
I will take care of Hua.

178
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,440
Thank you.

179
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,740
<i>Watching</i>

180
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,120
Get up! Hua.

181
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,840
Grandma.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Hua, you know what?

183
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,150
During the days you’re sleeping,

184
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,910
the peach flowers have bloomed.

185
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,720
The pomegranate tree in the yard
comes into bud.

186
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,390
I want you to have a look.

187
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
When will you wake up?

188
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,080
Though there’s beautiful scenery,

189
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,790
I have no one accompanying me.

190
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,510
Whether you can wake up or not,

191
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,960
I will be with you in my lifetime.

192
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
Why stop?

193
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,440
I’m trying to continue.

194
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,390
Hua, you are awake.

195
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,840
Keep saying. I want to listen more.

196
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,200
Do you feel uncomfortable?

197
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,270
No hurry to get up. Slowly.

198
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,200
I’ve been awake for a while.

199
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,750
I seldom hear you

200
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,600
saying these sweet words.

201
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,960
So I want to listen more.

202
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,200
When did you begin to listen?

203
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,240
Do you hope I heard more

204
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,960
or less?

205
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,390
If you want to listen,

206
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,550
I’d say so every day and night.

207
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,360
If it’s not enough,

208
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,030
I will say so all my life.

209
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,480
You can say such romantic words now.

210
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
You got something in the mind

211
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,910
while being assassinated that day?

212
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,360
Hua.

213
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,390
Promise me

214
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,200
you will never leave me, OK?

215
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
Don’t worry.

216
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,870
I will be with you all my life.

217
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
You can’t get rid of me.

218
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,140
<i>Holy Prince Qixian</i>

219
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,150
Thank God for your blessings.

220
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
May Hua be safe.

221
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,390
Hua, look.

222
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,240
I take your clothes…

223
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,480
Hua.

224
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,600
What’s that in your hands?

225
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,030
Nothing.

226
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,390
I’ll tell Mother and Father
you are awake.

227
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,510
Excuse me.

228
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,910
Please continue.

229
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,630
Continue.

230
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Hua, you know what?

231
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,030
When you were sleeping,

232
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,320
your parents couldn’t sleep well

233
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,200
all days and nights.

234
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,080
They went to everywhere in the capital

235
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,670
and tried to find a way to cure you.

236
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
They never had a break.

237
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,240
Heng worried about you too.

238
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,550
I’m so lucky

239
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,750
to have the family and you.

240
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,000
This is the reason why

241
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,270
I should try harder to protect you all.

242
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,600
How about we move outside the city?

243
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,840
Let’s not live such a worrying life.

244
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,150
I…

245
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
I’m afraid I’d stay in the Palace

246
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,320
for some more days.

247
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,790
Why?

248
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,120
Don’t you blame His Majesty now?

249
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,960
But you’re the one they wanted to kill.

250
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,030
Didn’t you find it out?

251
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,030
For the past,

252
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,910
we can surely just let it be.

253
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
But if we just leave like this,

254
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,910
Prince Luo will take the throne.

255
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
What will the ordinary people do?

256
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,360
I understand your thoughts.

257
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,480
But if you get yourself hurt,

258
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,080
I will never let it be.

259
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,440
Hua, you are together with me now.

260
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,720
I promise

261
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,840
I will be safe.

262
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,550
Come on. Be quick.

263
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,270
Hua has become starveling these days.

264
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,840
This porridge with red dates
and lotus seeds can benefit qi.

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,670
Pheasant with tortoise to refresh you.

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,030
Which one do you prefer?

267
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,550
This one.

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,320
Make it cooler.

269
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
Blow it. Don’t burn her.

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
Don’t worry about it.

271
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,320
Here. Slowly.

272
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,870
Take more.

273
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,670
Father. I’m fine now.

274
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,790
Sorry to make you worry.

275
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Here. Slowly.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,960
Oh, Rocky.

277
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,320
Go get my embroidered clothes.

278
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,200
I will go into the street.

279
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,910
No.

280
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
You just recovered.

281
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,550
Yes, you can’t go now.

282
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,720
I’m really fine. Go get it quickly.

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,720
Miss, how about changing to another one?

284
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,910
-Why?
-Change it.

285
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,120
I haven’t gone out for days.

286
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,320
Surely I’d wear the most beautiful one.

287
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,240
But that one…

288
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,910
Was…

289
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,910
Was…

290
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
Ban Heng.

291
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,200
Ban Heng!

292
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,270
Come on, Miss, don’t be angry.

293
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,670
-Come on. Blow it for her.
-Don’t be angry.

294
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,840
-Don’t be angry.
-Blow it.

295
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,360
Feixian, it’s really you.

296
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,000
Sorry for your suffering.

297
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,200
Did you hurt?

298
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,030
Where are you living now?

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,390
Thank you for caring.

300
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,030
I’m great.

301
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,550
But Crown Prince didn’t do a good job.

302
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,240
You must have suffered a lot.

303
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,630
Feixian, how could you say so?

304
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,200
Anyway, don’t worry.

305
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,880
When Prince Wude ascends the throne,

306
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,110
you don’t need to suffer that anymore.

307
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,160
You are living in Prince Luo’s?

308
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,680
I wanted to kill Count Cheng’an
but hurt Ban Hua.

309
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,680
It’s not my aim, but it makes
Count Cheng’an heartbroken.

310
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
It’s a good thing in other way.

311
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,440
You…

312
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,200
You can take this as a gift for you

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,750
to celebrate my coming back.

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
It’s you.

315
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,200
Prince Luo did that.

316
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,510
Prince Luo and Crown Prince
are brothers.

317
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,920
They should have worked together.

318
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,240
Am I right, Suyue?

319
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,960
Feixian, you changed.

320
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,160
After going through the affairs,

321
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,310
everyone would change.

322
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,350
Anyway,

323
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,880
if you need any help,

324
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,960
you can try to beg me and Prince Luo.

325
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,030
Feixian. Feixian.

326
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,030
She must be angry,

327
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
so she lost her way.

328
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
Please hide this thing.

329
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,240
How could Feixian become like this?

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,240
I will help her see the truth

331
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,240
and leave Prince Luo.

332
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,830
Miss. Be careful.

333
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,480
How many years we haven’t been here?

334
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
You just recovered.

335
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,000
So we take you to this quiet place

336
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,030
for your recuperation.

337
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,270
Isn’t it quite nice?

338
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,880
Come on. Let’s go.

339
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,920
Let’s go, Miss.

340
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,000
Come on.

341
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,110
It’s clean.

342
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
I’ve known you for years.

343
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,000
But I didn’t know you are considerate.

344
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,110
Of course.

345
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,240
People have cleaned here before we come.

346
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,270
Where is Count Cheng’an?

347
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,440
Miss, how about I give you a massage?

348
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,310
Yes, when you were in the coma,

349
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,720
Rocky has learnt the skill of massage

350
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,830
for recuperation from an expert.

351
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,480
It’s good for your body.

352
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,310
Now it’s time for you to enjoy.

353
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
Yes.

354
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,550
But…

355
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,030
Don’t worry, Hua.

356
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,110
If Count Cheng’an comes,

357
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,000
we won’t disturb you two.

358
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,350
Yes.

359
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,110
-Come on.
-Be quick.

360
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,160
Miss, this way, please.

361
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,880
Enjoy it.

362
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920
Let’s go.

363
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,640
Oh my God!

364
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,750
Time for the major business.

365
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Do you mean

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,270
Luo brought Feixian back?

367
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,550
Feixian was weak in mind.

368
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,720
Prince Luo took advantage of it.

369
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,310
Your Highness, would you please

370
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,070
take Feixian back?

371
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
I know your feelings.

372
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,400
But Feixian’s identity is special.

373
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,640
And it’s a business of Luo’s.

374
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,680
I can’t have a hand in it.

375
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,790
Prince Luo has an ulterior motive.

376
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,510
He always plays hard for his goal.

377
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,440
If he’s in danger one day,

378
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,030
he will surely give Feixian up.

379
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,400
Your Highness, please help my sister

380
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,510
for the sake of me.

381
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,070
Suyue.

382
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,550
Luo has deep love into Feixian.

383
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,720
He won’t abandon her.

384
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,200
Maybe Feixian

385
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,790
can marry Luo as a concubine.

386
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,720
It will keep Feixian safe.

387
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,310
No.

388
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,640
Why not?

389
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,200
You have fewer supporters than before.

390
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,720
Just Shi’s former men
are assisting hard.

391
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
Now Prince Luo got Xie’s force.

392
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,400
If he marries Feixian now,

393
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,680
those who supported you before

394
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,240
will work for Prince Luo.

395
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,350
It won’t be that serious.

396
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,240
You are the future emperor of Daye.

397
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,110
You should be on guard
against Prince Luo.

398
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,340
<i>Wude Mansion</i>

399
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,110
Wanyu was talking nonsense.

400
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,030
Please don’t be angry. Your Highness.

401
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,590
You love Miss Shi very much.

402
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I know it, but Wanyu doesn’t.

403
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,750
Please forgive her.

404
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,350
And please let me see her.

405
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,790
The Yan and Shi are declining now.

406
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,110
Wanyu is a bond

407
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,350
between you and the Xie family.

408
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,110
Thank you.

410
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,160
Softy.

411
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,270
The flowerpot is slanting.

412
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,880
Slanting? How about this?

413
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,640
Again. OK. Stop.

414
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,750
Chen.

415
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,590
The shelf.

416
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,200
Everybody, be quick.

417
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,880
Yes.

418
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,310
It’ll be bad if Hua finds this.

419
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,070
Find what?

420
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,030
You left me in the courtyard alone.

421
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,960
What are you doing here stealthily?

422
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,790
-What should we do?
-It’s not me.

423
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,680
Wedding jewelries.

424
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,350
Who is the girl you love?

425
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,880
Yes.

426
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,790
I’m not young anymore.

427
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,640
I hid it from you because I was too shy.

428
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,720
I can’t believe
you have such a good choice.

429
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,110
The bracelet is unique.

430
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,270
It’s great you love it.

431
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
What are you talking about?

432
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,720
So

433
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,920
Count Cheng’an arranged this?

434
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,640
I just want to help you two,

435
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,160
so I did it secretly.

436
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,310
He really took great efforts.

437
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,400
It seems someone has worn this dress.

438
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,110
Was he cheated by others?

439
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,270
How is it possible?

440
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,510
Nobody dares to cheat Count Cheng’an.

441
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,030
You are thinking too much.

442
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,830
That’s the design.

443
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,240
What about the hair?

444
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,480
How will you explain it?

445
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,000
Tell me the truth.

446
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,960
Otherwise, you have to practice sword

447
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,350
for 10 hours per day from now on.

448
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,350
10 hours?

449
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,160
Say it.

450
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,000
Xie Wanyu borrowed it that day.

451
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,750
Xie Wanyu?

452
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,480
Anything wrong with you?

453
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,590
How dare you divorce Prince Luo?

454
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,000
I don’t like him.

455
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,590
He doesn’t like me, either.

456
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,200
We shouldn’t have married.

457
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,440
If you worry about Shi Feixian,

458
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,030
it’s unnecessary.

459
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,440
Only if Shi Feixian doesn’t give birth,

460
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,830
she won’t take your title away.

461
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,270
Under the current circumstances,

462
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
you still don’t understand?

463
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,270
I don’t want to be the prince’s wife.

464
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,960
Don’t mention it again!

465
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,160
Two prime ministers are down.

466
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,110
Crown Prince is weak.

467
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,200
Working with Prince Luo
is the best choice.

468
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,160
I won’t let your willfulness

469
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,680
ruin our Xie’s future!

470
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,070
Have you ever thought about this?

471
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,070
You don’t want to be controlled by

472
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,680
the Yan’s, the Shi’s,
Princess Ban and Count Cheng’an.

473
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,070
What about me?

474
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,350
I’ve been under your
and Father’s control.

475
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,960
You misunderstood me. I definitely not…

476
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,680
Chongjin.

477
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,510
You’d better leave now.

478
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,750
Your Grace.

479
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,070
It’s been a long way.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

480
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,070
It doesn’t matter.

481
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,830
Rocky is so good at massaging.

482
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,030
I fell asleep

483
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,400
and I’m just awake.

484
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,750
That’ll be great.

485
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Hua, you know what?

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,070
There is a mysterious place behind.

487
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,510
Mysterious?

488
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,750
What is it?

489
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,790
Of course,

490
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,270
it’s a place you’d go there on your own.

491
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
Hua, just come with me. You will know.

492
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,640
That’s great.

493
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,310
Let’s go then.

494
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,480
Come on.

495
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,240
Is this cave the mysterious place

496
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,750
you mentioned?

497
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,510
What have you hidden in it?

498
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,240
The cave is so mysterious.

499
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,880
I will take you in.

500
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,640
Hua, follow me closely.

501
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,030
Don’t open your eyes

502
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,200
if I don’t ask you to.

503
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Hua, open your eyes.

504
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,590
Hua, will you marry me?

505
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,680
From now on,

506
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,750
you are my wife.

507
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,160
I will love you forever.

508
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,590
Be careful, Hua.

509
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,550
Why do you stop?

510
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,640
Follow me.

511
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,270
Your Grace, where are you taking me?

512
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,400
Why did you blow it out?

513
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,960
Don’t open your eyes

514
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,030
if I don’t ask you to.

515
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,030
Wait for me.

516
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,590
Hua.

517
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,790
Open your eyes.

518
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,240
Hua, look over there.

519
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
I’m skiing.

520
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
You are there too.

521
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,960
I went skiing with my brother
when I was a child.

522
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,590
My parents were looking aside.

523
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,070
After the Rong’s was destructed,

524
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,110
I haven’t gone skiing any longer.

525
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,270
On that day,

526
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,880
I felt the long-lost ease.

527
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,160
It’s like I was back to the old days.

528
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,880
Playing the Qin?

529
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,270
I only remember my hair was caught.

530
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,750
It’s embarrassing.

531
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,400
In order to be in love with me,

532
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,480
you tried something you didn’t like.

533
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
It’s romantic, not embarrassing.

534
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,440
Fall hunting!

535
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,680
It’s the first time

536
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,200
you taught me archery.

537
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,550
I was drunk at that time.

538
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,550
In a daze,

539
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,510
your dedicated face

540
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,110
looked beautiful.

541
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,200
I’ve born it in mind for a long time.

542
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,240
This is…

543
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,400
Neither you nor I expected

544
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
the kiss in the dangerous situation

545
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,270
led our love in this life.

546
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,400
So you planned it a long time ago?

547
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,160
It’s not a plan.

548
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,790
It’s fate.

549
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,790
Everybody, attention please.

550
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,590
Play the music as soon

551
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
as they come out later.

552
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,350
OK. OK.

553
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,550
It’s my sister’s big issue.

554
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,350
No error is allowed.

555
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,830
Got it.

556
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,310
-Got it.
-Got it.

557
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,000
What’s going on?

558
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,350
Why haven’t they come out?

559
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,440
After we get back to the capital,

560
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,630
I will apply to His Majesty

561
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,590
for allowing us to leave

562
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,590
and live a country life.

563
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,550
Are you serious?

564
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,440
I was originally filled with gloom.

565
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,550
Luckily, I met you.

566
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,670
I’ve thought it over.

567
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,190
You’re the most important in my life.

568
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,480
Hua.

569
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,840
Will you marry me?

570
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,070
From now on,

571
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,880
you are my wife.

572
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,150
I will love you forever.

573
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,480
No.

574
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,550
What are they doing inside?

575
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,150
Young Master. Here they are.

576
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,510
Step back.

577
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,920
Ready.

578
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,190
Three, two, one.

579
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,670
Hua, why are you out alone?

580
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,550
Where is my brother-in-law?

581
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,320
Yes.

582
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,920
Hua.

583
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,510
Am I too anxious?

584
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,510
How could you just refuse him?

585
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,510
It’s none of your business.

586
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,710
How could it be none of my business?

587
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,670
These days,

588
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,150
he prepared three sets of wedding dress.

589
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,840
Come on. Take a look.

590
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,670
He carefully selected them

591
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,710
for your wedding.

592
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,110
He caught the glowworms
all over the mountain.

593
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,920
He hung on the cave top
at night to paint honey to the wall.

594
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,440
He did so many things,
but you refused him.

595
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,280
Don’t you like him anymore?

596
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,800
Since you still like him,

597
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,960
why did you refuse him?

598
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,800
Are you worrying about the dream?

599
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,320
Enough. Say no more.

600
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,000
It’s my own marriage.

601
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,710
It’s none of your business.

602
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,590
Hua.

603
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,630
-Hua.
-Hua.

604
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,760
Hua.

605
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,670
It’s all because of you.

606
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,110
Well, enough.

607
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,480
He even got mad.

608
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,920
Coming.

609
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,510
Sorry for disturbing you at night.

610
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,670
What’s the matter?

611
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,550
Please give the letter to Her Grace.

612
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,900
<i>To Princess Ban From Rong Xia</i>

613
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,510
See you.

614
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,070
He just failed the proposal.

615
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,230
Is he going to escape?

616
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,230
Miss Softy, I didn’t go too far away.

617
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,480
Maybe you could keep the voice down.

618
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,630
He just gives up
when meeting such a setback.

619
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,670
How can he get the girl

620
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,190
if he has the jitters?

621
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,400
May I ask you a question?

622
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,670
How can I get the girl I love?

623
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,960
Which girl is she?

624
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,360
I can’t tell you that.

625
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,710
If you don’t make it clear,

626
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,920
how can I answer it?

627
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,710
Hua.

628
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,920
When I married your father,

629
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,320
I was two years younger
than you are now.

630
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,230
Of course, I know it.

631
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,960
You’ve said it for several times.

632
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,000
Others said your father was foppish,

633
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,070
ignorant and incompetent.

634
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,630
He only knew game foul.

635
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,960
He’s impossible to be
a good husband and father.

636
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,230
They even said life was hard for me.

637
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,070
It’s destined to have a painful life

638
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,710
if I married into the Ban’s.

639
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,360
They were talking nonsense.

640
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,590
You have such a good life now.

641
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,280
Then why do you think you can’t

642
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,590
have a good life if you marry him?

643
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,230
You love each other.

644
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,880
Both take the other side

645
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
as the most important one.

646
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,800
That’s the most precious of all.

647
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,190
For one’s life,

648
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,630
the most difficult thing

649
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,400
is to find one engaging with your minds.

650
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,590
Everything else

651
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,110
means nothing other than it.

652
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,230
Hua.

653
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,510
Life is what you make it to be

654
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,800
but not destined.

655
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,360
Don’t miss your lifetime beloved one

656
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,360
for a moment of timidity.

657
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,400
Young Master.

658
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,670
Young Master.

659
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,760
Go home.

660
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,320
Young Master, are we really going back?

661
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,920
Won’t you talk to Her Grace again?

662
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,630
Maybe I was too abrupt.

663
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,320
I did that without asking her.

664
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,920
So the thing went like this.

665
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,150
Now I feel too ashamed to meet Hua.
