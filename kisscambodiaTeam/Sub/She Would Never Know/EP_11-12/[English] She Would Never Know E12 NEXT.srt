ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,840
Where is he?

3
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,510
Where is he?

4
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,020
Where is Lee Jae-shin?

5
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,310
I think you've got the wrong person.

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,290
What?

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,890
You know where he is.

8
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,580
Where is he? Tell me quickly.

9
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,070
I don't know.

10
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,800
Where is your phone?

11
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,740
Call him.

12
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,300
Call Lee Jae-shin right now.

13
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,520
We're done here.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,550
I said call him!

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,480
Move.

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,590
Move!

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,800
Lee Hyo-joo!

18
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,970
Are you okay?

19
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,530
Why were you talking to Yoon Song-ah?

20
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,620
Why would you ask her about Jae-shin?

21
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,550
What happened between you and him?

22
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,530
What's going on?

23
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,270
There's nothing going on.

24
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,890
Not with me.

25
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,780
I can only help if you're honest with me!

26
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,400
Does it have something to do
with Yoon Song-ah?

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,760
I said nothing's going on!

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,650
Just find Jae-shin.

29
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,980
He's your friend.
Why don't you know where he is?

30
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,020
What exactly do you know?

31
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,950
What kind of friend are you?

32
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,500
I kept going back and forth
about calling you,

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,880
{\an8}EPISODE 12

34
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,240
and I thought it'd be better
to ask you directly.

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,890
I don't understand why Hyo-joo

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,630
said that to you yesterday.

37
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,760
Can you tell me why?

38
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,829
I think there was a misunderstanding.

39
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,490
What could there be to misunderstand?

40
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,990
Director Lee Jae-shin and I...

41
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,870
We were in a relationship.

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,970
Of course, that's over now.

43
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,380
So you two dated.

44
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,960
May I know when the relationship ended?

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,570
It was

46
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,010
quite recent.

47
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,960
Then, when my sister was dating him...

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,250
That was why we broke up.

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,440
Anyway, he and I are done.

50
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,610
I don't know why she came to me yesterday.

51
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,170
I see. You can leave now.

52
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,560
<i>Yoon Song-ah,</i>

53
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,170
by any chance, do you know
where Jae-shin might be?

54
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,040
He's turned in a letter of resignation

55
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,790
and I can't get in touch with him.

56
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
Two hot americanos with
two shots of espresso

57
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,300
and two pumps of vanilla syrup, please.

58
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,850
Here you go.

59
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,080
We'll call your name when they're ready.

60
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,320
Thank you.

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Two hot americanos, please.

62
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,790
I'm jealous.

63
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,740
He's got a fiancée and a mistress.

64
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,980
This is why you need to be a big shot.

65
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,970
Who? Oh, Director Lee Jae-shin?

66
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,110
He's probably going to get fired though.

67
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,490
The chairman won't take this lightly.

68
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,910
That female employee's career is over too.

69
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,140
She'd be too ashamed to show her face.

70
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,280
Did you look her up?

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,510
She's pretty.

72
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,200
That's probably why he was seeing her.

73
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,120
Right.

74
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,480
Should we go take a look?

75
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,480
Excuse me.

76
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:00,390
You should be more careful
about what you say.

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,659
Who are you?

78
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,659
I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

79
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,770
If you want to see what she looks like,

80
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,650
do that when you're sued for slander.

81
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,600
-That's okay.
-No, it's okay.

82
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,990
Thank you.

83
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,560
What's Yoon Song-ah's relationship
with Director Lee?

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know.

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,840
I heard Chairman's
granddaughter went berserk.

86
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,330
She was shouting and acting crazy.

87
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,020
-Maybe they're having an affair.
-An affair?

88
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,700
She's got some nerve.

89
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,300
He's engaged to Chairman's granddaughter.

90
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,710
She's shameless.

91
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,020
That's why she's messing around like that.

92
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,940
-No self-respect at all.
-Song-ah.

93
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,360
Do you want something to drink?

94
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,909
Yes, I want to get some coffee.

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
Excuse me.

96
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,190
I'm not as brazen as you think I am.

97
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,360
Nothing's going on
between Director Lee and me.

98
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,530
You seem curious.

99
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,180
No, we aren't.

100
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,690
Come on.

101
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,140
Let's go.

102
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,280
Watch your mouth!

103
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,480
You did great.

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,220
This kind of chatter dies down soon.

105
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,660
I know it's hard now but just ignore it.

106
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,060
Okay.

107
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,080
You don't have to stay in the office.

108
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,130
Do you want to go out?

109
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,760
Why avoid them? She's done nothing wrong.

110
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,020
That's not what I meant.

111
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,220
The weather is nice today.
She could let off some steam.

112
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,909
It's fine.

113
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,480
I have a meeting later.

114
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,990
I'll just stay in the office.

115
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,030
If that doesn't bother you.

116
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,790
What are you talking about?

117
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,159
Stop that nonsense.

118
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,190
Let's have something nice for lunch.

119
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,870
I'm sure Manager Kwon will gladly pay.

120
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Okay.

121
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:37,130
{\an8}CHAE HYUN-SEUNG

122
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,880
<i>Pay for the coffee
by thinking of nothing</i>

123
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
<i>but me today.</i>

124
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,260
Jae-shin?

125
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,230
-Come out.
-No.

126
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,610
I'm going to wait for him here.

127
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,500
You knew Jae-shin was seeing someone.

128
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
How long have you known?

129
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,480
That's not a problem.

130
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
I won't allow this.

131
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go.

132
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,530
You don't get any say in this.

133
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,120
That's my business.

134
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,150
How could this be your own business?

135
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,080
Do you have no self-respect?

136
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,260
Why are you giving yourself up for him?

137
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,670
You deserve more than this!

138
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,460
Because I love him.

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,130
I can't live without Jae-shin.

140
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,430
I can't.

141
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,240
Walk straight. You might trip.

142
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,820
I'll just trip then.

143
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,780
I don't care about falling.

144
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,500
I don't care about crashing
or getting lost.

145
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,150
I'd welcome it all if I can be with you.

146
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,270
What I'm saying is,

147
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,670
you can tell people about us.

148
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,540
It's okay to tell people we're dating.

149
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,920
It'd make things easier for you at work.

150
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,860
But it'd complicate things for you.

151
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,090
Thank you.

152
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,490
I prefer a hug over a thank you.

153
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,540
I'll always be by your side
anytime, anywhere.

154
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,160
You can lean on me at any time.

155
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,670
I'm here for you.

156
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

157
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,180
I took notes of today's recipe.

158
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,360
You can go over them at home.

159
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,560
-Okay.
-Good job, everyone.

160
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,700
Thank you.

161
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,040
We had a great time today, Chef.

162
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,990
So did I.

163
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,260
I have something to tell you.

164
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,540
Today's the last day of cooking class.

165
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,420
Oh.

166
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,460
Why so sudden?

167
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,870
Is everything okay?

168
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,830
It's just taking more
out of me than I thought.

169
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,990
I want to focus on the restaurant.

170
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,550
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,290
I guess this is it then.

172
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,570
It sure is a bummer.

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,250
-It really is.
-That's too bad.

174
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,670
-We do thank you though.
-Thank you.

175
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,340
You can go. I'll do the cleanup.

176
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,870
Let me help. It's a lot to do by yourself.

177
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,270
No. It's more convenient for me
to do it by myself.

178
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,470
Is everything okay with you?

179
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,420
Yes, everything's fine.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,690
That's good.

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,920
You know we are friends, right?

182
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,980
I'm here if something's troubling you.

183
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,170
Okay.

184
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,630
Did I call you out at a bad time?

185
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,870
No, I have some downtime.

186
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,290
What brings you here by the way?

187
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,020
I was having lunch
with a former team member

188
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,560
and I thought of you.

189
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,600
I'll just cut to the chase.

190
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,200
Have you thought about
working somewhere else?

191
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,480
Working somewhere else?

192
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,520
You know I'm working at a foreign company.

193
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,590
Yes.

194
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,480
My team needs
an assistant-manager-level ABM.

195
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,610
I think you'd be perfect for it.

196
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,190
We haven't found the right person yet.

197
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,420
I'd like to work with you.

198
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,390
Your salary would be
much higher there too.

199
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,760
Thank you for thinking of me,

200
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,270
but I haven't considered
changing jobs yet.

201
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,030
Not even once?

202
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,270
It's about time to consider.

203
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,840
Why don't you chew it over?

204
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,110
It won't hurt you.

205
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,950
I'll email you the details.

206
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,840
Okay.

207
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,430
One more thing.

208
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,150
I heard you're in trouble at work.

209
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,090
I know it's just a rumor, so don't worry.

210
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,930
I just want to tell you that
this could be an option for you.

211
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,230
I know.

212
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,900
I'll contact you.

213
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,930
Oh, this?

214
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,380
Senior Yoon asked me to buy it.

215
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,940
You don't have to lie.

216
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,600
We all know.

217
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,670
Of course, we know.

218
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,400
How could we not?

219
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,160
Finally. It was hard
pretending not to know.

220
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,630
What? What's with the look?

221
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,770
Why do you all look so surprised?

222
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,910
I've been working here for so long.

223
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,310
Anyway, take good care of her.

224
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,730
You're the only one she can rely on now.

225
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,310
I will.

226
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,560
Thank you.

227
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,350
They said that?

228
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,730
I guess we really are terrible actors.

229
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,730
No wonder they were acting weird.

230
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,570
Even though we're in the same team,

231
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,720
I didn't expect their trust when
there's a rumor going around about me.

232
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,150
I'm so grateful to them.

233
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,300
Come on.

234
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,900
It's because you get along with them well.

235
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,120
Even if they didn't know about us,

236
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,740
they'd definitely believe you too.

237
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,960
Whose girlfriend is this great person?

238
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,760
Whose girlfriend is this great person?

240
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,170
Whose girlfriend am I? Of course
I'm Chae Hyun-seung's girlfriend.

241
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,520
I have something to tell.

242
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,590
I met a former colleague earlier.

243
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,290
When you went out for a while just now?

244
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,420
She asked if I wanted to work with her.

245
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,780
I see. And then?

246
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,210
I told her I'll think about it.

247
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,950
What's your thought, Hyun-seung?

248
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,870
I get a say in this?

249
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,300
Of course.

250
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,570
This affects us too.

251
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,730
Us.

252
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,740
If I were being selfish,

253
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,300
I'd say I want you in the same office.

254
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,900
But this is about your career.

255
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,540
If this job offer is better for you,

256
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,330
you should take it.

257
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,160
What I want is for you to do
what you want to do.

258
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,580
<i>How many days has it been?</i>

259
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,310
He quit this company.

260
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,820
Why aren't you accepting his resignation?

261
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,980
You're too soft.

262
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,640
That's how you get stabbed in the back!

263
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,210
-I'm sorry.
-Stop saying it and show me some action!

264
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,740
With the Europe project and everything,

265
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,000
we have too many things to care about.

266
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,890
There is no time to waste on that goon.

267
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,550
Are you that incompetent?

268
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,640
You can't work without him by your side?

269
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
About that...

270
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,150
I'll make sure the project goes smoothly.

271
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,650
That worthless hoodlum.

272
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,290
How dare he embarrass me like this?

273
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,550
You better make it clear with Hyo-joo too.

274
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,349
If she makes another scene because of him,

275
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:38,540
I'll disown her just like
what I did to your parents.

276
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,630
If you don't cut ties with him,

277
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,490
I'll take away your position too!

278
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,670
Manager Kwon!

279
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,300
URGENT NOTICE: PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

280
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,340
KLAR SENIOR MANAGER KWON -
KLAR ACTING BM

281
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,010
DATE OF APPOINTMENT:
EFFECTIVE AS OF TODAY

282
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,200
What in the world?

283
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,830
Manager Kwon Sung-yeon.

284
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,470
Did you see the notice?

285
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,370
I just saw it.

286
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,390
You'll be the acting BM
before we find a new BM.

287
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,790
What about Director Lee Jae-shin?

288
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,250
You won't be seeing him here anymore.

289
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,540
Report to me about
the projected sales for this month.

290
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,560
What in the world is happening?

291
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,390
Is BM Lee really not coming back?

292
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,030
Let's just...

293
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,120
I'll find out more about it later.

294
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,550
Let's see.

295
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,530
Let's get the projected sales
for this month.

296
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,380
Let me ask around a bit.

297
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,850
Thank you. Please come again.

298
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,940
Thank you.

299
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,110
Hello.

300
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,210
I want a refund.

301
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,850
Sure. Just one second.

302
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,880
Do you have the receipt?

303
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,850
I'll get a refund for you right away.

304
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,920
May I know why you want to return it?

305
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,850
I watched a scrub review video

306
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,340
and it said the product is bad.

307
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,190
It doesn't exfoliate
and it'll damage your skin.

308
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,630
Our products?

309
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,270
That's not possible.

310
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,630
Can you show me that video?

311
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,090
<i>What's worse than KLAR's mascara?</i>

312
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,190
{\an8}BEAUTY FUN FUN

313
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,320
<i>It's their cream shadow.</i>

314
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,540
<i>The creasing effect is just too much.</i>

315
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,980
<i>Do you see this?</i>

316
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,090
<i>It gets on the small creases,</i>

317
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,510
<i>making them stand out.</i>

318
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,420
<i>And it hardens so fast.</i>

319
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,820
<i>Look at this.</i>

320
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,580
<i>It's very hard.</i>

321
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,600
<i>Who would buy this?</i>

322
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,050
People are returning our products
because of this video?

323
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes.

324
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,750
Three people came in for a refund today.

325
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,060
She might be sabotaging
our brand on purpose.

326
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,670
She's bashing our basic skincare
and color makeup.

327
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,000
It's not just a simple low-star review.

328
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,670
I agree.

329
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,520
But we don't have any concrete evidence.

330
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,770
If we provoke her without evidence,

331
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,050
it'll backfire on us.

332
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,810
In the worst-case scenario,

333
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,750
it'll damage our brand image.

334
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,990
I think she has a routine.

335
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,440
Why?

336
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,450
She targets certain brands
and leaves bad reviews.

337
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,660
This kind of content gets higher hits.

338
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,400
She got a few hundred thousand views.

339
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,040
So she gets more subscribers this way.

340
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,110
And we're her unlucky victim this time.

341
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,650
What do we do?

342
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,720
We can't just let this happen.

343
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Of course, but we can't do
anything right now.

344
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,700
We need concrete evidence.

345
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,590
<i>Are you really going to spend
the whole night watching all her videos?</i>

346
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,590
Yes.

347
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,340
I'm not sure if I'll find something,

348
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,900
<i>but I want to do everything I can.</i>

349
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,450
<i>I can't sit by while our products
get slandered.</i>

350
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,960
<i>I'll watch the videos with you then.</i>

351
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,850
You will?

352
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,770
It's our job. And it's my brand too.

353
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,100
<i>It feels very smooth.</i>

354
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,710
<i>Let me test if it lasts long.</i>

355
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,520
<i>I'm going to apply it around my eye.</i>

356
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,170
<i>It applies very well. The more layers...</i>

357
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,280
<i>I have to tell you this.</i>

358
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,570
<i>I'm so angry at the poor quality
of this product.</i>

359
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,790
<i>I just had to post a video.</i>

360
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,900
<i>I don't want these for my subscribers.</i>

361
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,680
<i>Don't waste your money on
this garbage cosmetics.</i>

362
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,910
<i>Oh, my.</i>

363
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,190
<i>The design is cute and lovely.</i>

364
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,850
<i>The quantity is smaller
than other brands.</i>

365
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,390
<i>The texture is moist
and glossy, not matte.</i>

366
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,690
<i>You can see how clean
the shading effect is.</i>

367
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,410
<i>You get moist lips
and it doesn't come off easily.</i>

368
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,640
<i>So it looks natural.</i>

369
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,460
<i>The mirror is big,
so you can see very well.</i>

370
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,810
<i>This puff...</i>

371
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Huh?

372
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,460
<i>What is it?</i>

373
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,690
Senior Yoon.

374
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,700
I got the purchase history
from the CRM Team.

375
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,720
Really?

376
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,810
She's been buying our products and yet
she said it was her first time using them.

377
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,880
She's been a VIP customer for years.

378
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,970
You found her reviews on our online mall?

379
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,310
Right here.

380
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,800
She said the scrub is a holy grail item.

381
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,020
And she said our cream shadow is good,
so she bought all the colors.

382
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,400
This will definitely get her to back off.

383
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,350
She'll have to.

384
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,970
If not, we'll take legal measures.

385
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,610
You're meeting her today, right?

386
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,760
I won't remove the video.

387
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,450
That's why you contacted me, right?

388
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,490
No.

389
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,470
No?

390
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,780
Everyone has their own preferences
for makeup products.

391
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,420
We understand if you are not satisfied.

392
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,590
We're here to confirm
some information with you.

393
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,760
Confirm what?

394
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,470
I watched your video.
You said you'd never used our products.

395
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,800
That's right.
I only use imported products.

396
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,150
But when we were
looking through your videos,

397
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,240
we found something familiar.

398
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,630
What's this?

399
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,920
This was our VIP gift two years ago.

400
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,260
I got this from a friend.

401
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,060
I didn't even know I had this.

402
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,990
Take a look at this then.

403
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,570
We searched the portal
and found your name.

404
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,440
We compared that with our CRM data.

405
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,690
You've been our VIP customer
for three years straight.

406
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,720
Those were all gifts for others.

407
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,190
Even if I did use them,

408
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,610
are you saying that I can't give
bad reviews if they suck?

409
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,730
Of course not.

410
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,100
But, a week ago,

411
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,320
you said the same product
was a holy grail item.

412
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,780
We can only suspect that
you exploited KLAR

413
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,590
for your personal gain.

414
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,510
For example, you wanted to cause a stir

415
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,150
and boost the number of your subscribers.

416
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,870
That's funny.
I already have so many subscribers.

417
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,090
I'm going to post
what you're doing right now.

418
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,450
Go ahead with it.
The law will be the judge.

419
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,290
We're going to hold you responsible

420
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,390
for the damage of our brand image
and the drop in sales.

421
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,390
That's why we asked to see you today.

422
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,170
So what now?

423
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,430
What do you want me to do?

424
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,890
The decision is yours.

425
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,780
Just as your subscribers
are important to you,

426
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,000
every one of our customers
is important to us too.

427
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,390
We do our very best
when we create a product,

428
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,280
so that we won't disappoint them.

429
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,330
We hope the same for you.

430
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,960
Don't disappoint your subscribers.

431
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,310
Oh, my!

432
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,390
I made that in the cooking class.
I want you to try them too.

433
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,420
Thank you so much.

434
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,680
How is the class? Still having fun?

435
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,150
It's over now.

436
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,640
Isn't it an on-going project?

437
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,570
The chef wanted to focus
on the restaurant

438
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,850
and so he ended it.

439
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,270
That's too bad.

440
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,580
I know you were enjoying it.

441
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,380
There's nothing I can do.
It's his class anyway.

442
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,840
By the way, I prepared two servings.

443
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,240
Hmm?

444
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,960
It's for you and
your mysterious boyfriend.

445
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,620
Okay.

446
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,480
I ended the cooking class.

447
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,050
Your wife knows it.

448
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,170
I heard.

449
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,510
She seems like a good person.

450
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,140
She seems genuine.

451
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,370
Unlike you.

452
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,180
How much longer will you deceive her?

453
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,160
What do you mean?

454
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,630
Can I tell her the truth then?

455
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,020
About how we got close and grew apart?

456
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,560
You already told her.

457
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,830
You wanted to befriend me
and so we got close,

458
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,430
then we grew apart as we didn't get along.

459
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,180
You're the one who ran away.

460
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,510
Like a coward.

461
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,840
What are you trying to say?

462
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,130
You disgust me.

463
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,480
It's the same now as it was back then.

464
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,660
You draw a line because you're scared.

465
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,990
And you leave me
to deal with the aftermath.

466
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,900
Do you really see me as a friend?

467
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,570
Have you ever thought of me as a friend?

468
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,590
If I haven't, it's your fault.

469
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,360
You project your feelings onto me
and cross the line.

470
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,420
-Don't come around anymore.
-That's right.

471
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,350
I still like you.

472
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,750
That's why I can see clearly.

473
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,260
You're afraid to accept yourself.

474
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,070
And I pity you for that.

475
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,640
I don't have to accept anything.
This is me.

476
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,950
What happened in college?

477
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,420
That was a one-time thing. A mistake.

478
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,130
I'm not the same as you.

479
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,590
I like men?

480
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,880
Are you crazy?

481
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,200
I thought we could go home together.

482
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
I didn't know you have a guest.

483
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,050
He's here because of his wrist.

484
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,300
I'm done. We can leave now.

485
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,290
No. I forgot to pick up Ha-eun.

486
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,220
She must be waiting for me.

487
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,580
I'll get going now.

488
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,190
Man.

489
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,180
This looks wonderful.

490
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,080
I didn't make this,
but I hope you enjoy it.

491
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,350
Thank you.

492
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,870
Is it good?

493
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,170
It's really delicious.

494
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,840
I love watching you eat.

495
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,580
I love shrimp.

496
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,540
There's a lot of shrimp. Eat more.

497
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,230
This is peppermint tea.
It's good for relieving tension.

498
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,500
Something's going on, right?

499
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,610
You sounded tired on the phone.

500
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,980
And you look very tired too.

501
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,270
Does it show that much?

502
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,370
Is it something you can't share?

503
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,400
If it is, you don't have to tell me.

504
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,360
I'm just worried about you.

505
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,940
It's about my best friend.

506
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,820
He's severed all contact

507
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,790
and disappeared.

508
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,230
Actually, he's my sister's fiancée.

509
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:59,400
I guess it was just me
who thought we were friends.

510
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,780
I knew he didn't really
consider me as one.

511
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,020
But having that thrown in my face,

512
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,740
it's...

513
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,640
It hurts a lot.

514
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,090
I feel betrayed too.

515
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,300
I'm more worried
about my sister right now.

516
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,360
I don't know if Hyo-joo
will let Jae-shin go.

517
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,180
Hyo-joo?

518
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,820
Are you talking about Lee Jae-shin?

519
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,490
Then Lee Hyo-joo...

520
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,450
You know my sister?

521
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,050
She was my customer.
I mean, she used to be.

522
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,790
What a small world!

523
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,440
I love that I have a shoulder to lean on.

524
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,080
It's nice.

525
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,350
Here's a cold glass of beer.

526
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,250
Thank you.

527
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,480
Cheers.

528
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,380
Great work, Senior Yoon.

529
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,139
You too.

530
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,040
Do you think she'll remove the video?

531
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,310
We'll have to wait and see.

532
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,300
We've done our part.

533
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,750
The rest is up to the legal team.

534
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,850
Have you decided what to do
about the job offer?

535
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:42,639
Why?

536
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,550
Looking at you today,
I don't think you'll leave.

537
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,940
Even if you do, I think you'll come back.

538
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,780
You can tell, right?

539
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,770
I noticed this from the beginning.

540
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,800
Do you like KLAR that much?

541
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,480
Yes.

542
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:00,489
Why?

543
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,290
I don't know.
I just love being a KLAR marketer.

544
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:08,580
I love being able to say KLAR is my brand.

545
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,270
I feel especially good

546
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,910
when I see someone using our product.

547
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,180
My first product is lipstick.

548
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,900
I was on a bus

549
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,460
and saw someone taking it out of her bag.

550
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,880
I wanted to ask her how she likes it,

551
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,550
and tell her that
I'm the one who developed it.

552
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,500
It was so hard trying to stay still.

553
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,640
Really?

554
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Yes.

555
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,000
What?

556
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,040
What?

557
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,360
What's with you?

558
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,250
Screw this wretched world.

559
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,460
Wretched?

560
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,260
The world is beautiful. Right?

561
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,860
<i>I'd like to apologize for
my recent post.</i>

562
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,590
<i>The KLAR product review was misinformed.</i>

563
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,760
<i>I wanted to make it more interesting,</i>

564
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,790
<i>and so I exaggerated
some things in my video.</i>

565
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,570
<i>I'd like to apologize to all my viewers.</i>

566
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,690
Okay.

567
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,380
With this apology, things will smooth out.

568
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,400
The return requests died down too.

569
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,900
Did you ask the PR team
to release an article?

570
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,910
Yes, they'll print that
we won't press charges.

571
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,060
I heard you two worked hard on this.

572
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,460
Well done.

573
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,310
Thank you.

574
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,320
Let's have an office dinner soon.

575
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,630
Sounds great.

576
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,850
You're dismissed.

577
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,060
Okay.

578
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,330
Thank you.

579
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,100
Give me a moment, ABM Yoon Song-ah.

580
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,420
Did you hear from Jae-shin by any chance?

581
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,380
I don't think he'll be contacting me.

582
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,150
If he does, could you let me know?

583
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,780
I won't take it the wrong way.

584
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,770
Okay, sir.

585
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,360
Now onto another topic.

586
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,650
Did you receive a job offer recently?

587
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,160
Things might be uncomfortable right now,

588
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,400
but I hope you're not going to leave us.

589
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,930
You're very much needed at our company.

590
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,720
Thank you.

591
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,430
You need to eat.

592
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,380
It's been days.

593
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,890
I don't feel like eating. Go away.

594
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,690
Your brother told me to make sure you eat.

595
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,970
Just a little bit.

596
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,220
I'll leave this here then.

597
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,340
Please eat some.

598
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,940
Did you find him?

599
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,930
<i>His phone has been turned off,</i>

600
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,560
<i>and he's not using his credit card.</i>

601
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,750
<i>It's not easy to track him.</i>

602
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,620
If it were easy,
I wouldn't have hired you.

603
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,910
I'll pay you more. Just find him!

604
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,180
That's it for the weekly meeting.

605
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Right,

606
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,250
we're getting an intern today.

607
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,300
Already?

608
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,550
I know, right.

609
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,710
Wasn't it yesterday Hyun-seung joined us?

610
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,070
You were so fresh-faced back then.

611
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,340
It's only a year,
but I can hardly recognize you already.

612
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,590
Should I break down in tears
right about now?

613
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,740
I was joking.

614
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,730
Don't cry.

615
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,070
Right, sir.

616
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,280
I was wondering.

617
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,410
The intern's desk.

618
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,330
Where should we put it?

619
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,050
It's best if it's next to you.

620
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,160
But this is the only empty desk we have.

621
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,080
Set it up here.

622
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,190
Yes, sir.

623
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,600
You want some help?

624
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,210
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

625
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,880
Can I have a moment, everyone?

626
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,570
This is Ko Myung-jin.

627
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,080
He'll be our intern for a month.

628
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,370
Hello, I'm Ko Myung-jin.

629
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,690
It's nice to meet you.

630
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,740
You can greet him later.

631
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,560
Your desk is here.

632
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,450
You'll learn the basics
from ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

633
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,350
Yes, sir.

634
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,390
It's nice to meet you.

635
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,600
Nice to meet you too.

636
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,410
Yes.

637
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,160
Myung-jin.

638
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,770
You can sit.

639
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,800
Yes, sir.

640
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,640
Did you learn how to access the intranet?

641
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,690
I can show you.

642
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,760
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

643
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,870
If you need anything, let me know.

644
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,410
I'll explain our brand
in the meeting room later.

645
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,540
Okay.

646
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,680
I think that covers the brand description.

647
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,370
Now about the job assignments
within the team.

648
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,020
There are basic skincare and call sales.

649
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,660
We have color makeup
and department store sales too.

650
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,640
At the same time, we manage PR,

651
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,670
inventory management
and visual merchandising.

652
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,950
To put it plainly,

653
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,990
our task is to manage all the processes

654
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,890
from product manufacturing to sales.

655
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,890
I see.

656
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,680
Is there anything else
you'd like to know more about?

657
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,450
Feel free to ask.

658
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,120
I had many questions when I was an intern.

659
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,290
I don't have any though.

660
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,120
Okay then.

661
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,440
I think we're done here.

662
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,330
Okay.

663
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,630
It's close to lunchtime now.

664
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,900
Do you want to join us for lunch?

665
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,250
How about the cafeteria?

666
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,420
I'll eat by myself.

667
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,500
I can do that, right?

668
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,600
Sure, if that's what you want.

669
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,910
Thank you.

670
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,820
Okay.

671
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,480
Oh, my god.

672
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,290
You've been turned down?

673
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,710
This is our colleague,
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

674
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,560
Our interns.

675
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,870
Hello.

676
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,500
Hello.

677
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,180
Looking sharp, right?

678
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,570
Let's go. I'll save you from eating alone.

679
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,790
Let's go.

680
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,880
We're meeting the sales team today.

681
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,720
They asked for our input
about their sales promotion.

682
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,020
Marketing usually gives them policies,

683
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,750
but sometimes they do their own thing.

684
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,790
I see.

685
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,520
Sir.

686
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,470
Yes?

687
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,940
I'll be honest with you.

688
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,350
I'll soon be joining another company.

689
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,300
This is just for the experience.

690
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,580
So you don't need to train me.

691
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,890
I know.

692
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,280
<i>Our team's intern said</i>

693
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,960
your intern is going to another company.

694
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,790
Really?

695
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,200
Yes. So don't waste your time on him.

696
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,990
I'm still going to
do my best to train you.

697
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,630
That won't make me stay here.

698
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,210
That's not what I'm trying to achieve.

699
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,480
But I learned this from my trainer.

700
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,120
A brand marketer must think that
he is the brand.

701
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,330
When you hear KLAR's name in the future,

702
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,900
I'm sure I will cross your mind.

703
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,230
I don't want to be remembered

704
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,960
as an insincere and irresponsible person.

705
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,770
Let's get on.

706
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,430
Ahem.

707
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:27,960
<i>Chef Ryu isn't seeing anyone, right?</i>

708
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,910
No. But I don't think he'd be interested.

709
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,320
Marriage isn't his thing.

710
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,500
It'd be nice. But…

711
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,030
You can't always get what you want.

712
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,290
What were you two like in college?

713
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,020
I liked him.

714
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,280
Honey.

715
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,030
Are you happy when you are with me?

716
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,190
I'm suddenly curious.

717
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,380
I'm happy, are you?

718
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,480
I'm grateful.

719
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,500
Thank you for being my wife.

720
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,150
Do you have something
to say to Hyun-seung?

721
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,540
Gosh.

722
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,540
It's about the brand description.

723
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,690
Can I get the original file?

724
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,290
Okay. Sure.

725
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,890
Thank you.

726
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,920
Also,

727
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,350
can you buy me lunch tomorrow?

728
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,310
At the cafeteria.

729
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,460
Okay.

730
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,340
Sure.

731
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,410
Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

732
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,910
Thank you, Senior Chae!

733
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,440
Bye!

734
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,380
Take that home.

735
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,420
Bye!

736
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,270
Bye.

737
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,880
Mommy!

738
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,850
Ha-eun!

739
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,500
Oh? Uncle!

740
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,230
Where's Mommy?

741
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,520
Something came up,
so she asked me to get you.

742
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,080
Is she on a date with Daddy again?

743
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,540
Maybe. What will you do then?

744
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,010
You want to go on a date with me?

745
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,400
Let's go on a date.

746
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,610
-Let's do that.
-Sounds good.

747
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,810
Awesome.

748
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,170
How did you grow so tall?

749
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,810
Excuse me?

750
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,640
I'm going to grow as tall as you.

751
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,200
Ha-eun said she'll marry me
if I become as tall as you.

752
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,170
One moment, please.

753
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Marry him?

754
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,350
I was feeling generous.

755
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,430
Just like that?

756
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,930
Why are we standing here?

757
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,470
Just one moment.

758
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,320
Senior Yoon!

759
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,150
Hello, Ha-eun!

760
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,900
Meet my girlfriend.

761
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,810
You finally did it!

762
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,560
Now you know I'm good.

763
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,770
I found it!

764
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,160
You found it!

765
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,320
Should we get the bigger one?

766
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,560
Where are the potatoes? Potatoes.

767
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,690
Here they are!

768
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,100
Let's give it to him.

769
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,510
What do you think will be better?

770
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,230
-This one.
-That one?

771
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:00,120
But that one has a bug in it. A bug!

772
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,710
Which one looks good?

773
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,060
-It's good.
-Is it good?

774
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,380
You're giving me one?

775
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,340
It's very delicious.

776
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,000
Should we ask your uncle to get this?

777
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,920
My uncle buys me many toys.

778
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,200
Really?

779
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,100
Let's dry your hands.

780
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,070
My uncle plays tennis very well.

781
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,270
Oh, I see. That's great.

782
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,360
My uncle listens very well too.

783
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,140
So you did well, Auntie.

784
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,620
Okay.

785
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,220
How is it?

786
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,260
It's so good!

787
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,460
It's delicious. Isn't it, Ha-eun?

788
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,050
I love it.

789
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:38,990
Is it good?

790
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,700
Eat as much as you want, Ha-eun.

791
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,110
Do you want mussels?

792
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,260
Here.

793
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,180
My hands are tied.

794
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,980
Seriously.

795
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,320
Here.

796
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:03,930
Thank you.

797
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,930
It's so delicious.

798
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,220
I can sell this.

799
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,200
Who is prettier? Auntie Song-ah or me?

800
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,230
You're asking me?

801
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,400
Of course you're prettier, Ha-eun!

802
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,590
You should've said
your girlfriend is prettier.

803
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,640
I'm sorry, Auntie.

804
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,800
My uncle still has a long way to go.

805
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,270
This is my girlfriend.

806
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,880
It's very nice to meet you.

807
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,270
Now I see why Hyun-seung looked all happy.

808
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,210
Open the door for me.

809
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:03,960
Okay.

810
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,650
Be careful.

811
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,950
Her backpack.

812
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,130
Thank you.

813
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,940
Let's grab dinner
when both of you are free.

814
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,690
It'll be my treat.

815
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,070
That sounds great.

816
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,230
Why is Ha-eun sleeping at your place?

817
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,120
Yeon-seung went to
a funeral with Wu-hyun.

818
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,000
They are out of town.

819
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,230
Drive safely.

820
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,630
See you another time.

821
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,680
Sure. Drive safely.

822
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,640
Bye.

823
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:06,580
She said you buy her toys,
play tennis well

824
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,470
and listen to her well.

825
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,440
Then, she complimented me on my choice.

826
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,560
Ha-eun is very wise for her age.

827
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,390
I'm worried if I set
her standards too high.

828
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,630
But she left out the most important thing.

829
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,420
What I do best is loving Yoon Song-ah.

830
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,330
More like you say
corny things really well.

831
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,050
Action speaks louder than words.

832
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,900
Want me to show you?

833
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,170
Stop it. You're too much.

834
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,270
I'm sorry to show up like this.

835
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,840
I really need to tell you something.

836
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,300
Can we talk?

837
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,440
If you must say something,

838
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,560
just say it here.

839
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,280
It's not something
you have to worry about.

840
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,950
Please.

841
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,050
I'll head home.

842
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,070
Call me afterward.

843
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,050
Okay.

844
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,310
You said you wanted to talk.

845
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,290
I was thinking...

846
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,270
I never properly apologized to you.

847
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,120
This may sound like an excuse,

848
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,280
but I didn't mean to keep lying to you.

849
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,520
I wanted to tell you.

850
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,960
But when I was with you,

851
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:37,020
I could be myself.

852
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,250
I didn't have to be scared that
you'll see the real me.

853
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:49,500
I could be myself in front of you.

854
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,440
I wanted to hold on to you
just one more day.

855
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,690
I thought maybe you'll be understanding.

856
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,330
I was selfish
and let things unravel like that.

857
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,580
Because I was afraid that you'd leave me.

858
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,570
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

859
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,500
I just...

860
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,720
It was real for me.

861
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,050
I'm sorry that it ended the way it did.

862
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,940
I just wanted to tell you this in person.

863
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,020
I heard you resigned.

864
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,040
What will you do from now on?

865
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,620
I haven't thought that far ahead.

866
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,760
I'm going to start over
with what I truly have.

867
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,440
If I've fallen to the bottom,

868
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,430
then that's where I'll start.

869
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,780
By the way,

870
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,630
Jae-woon might find out about our past.

871
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,570
I'll make sure you
won't be treated unfairly.

872
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:13,980
He already knows.

873
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,090
I hope that didn't cause you trouble.

874
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,440
It didn't.

875
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,970
And also,

876
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,490
don't worry about me.

877
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,550
Not anymore.

878
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,410
Okay.

879
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,360
I understand.

880
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,710
Can I come in?

881
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,670
Come in.

882
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,960
Is everything okay?

883
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,530
Why are you here?

884
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,400
I wanted to see you.

885
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:51,920
You should've called me.

886
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,310
I didn't want to waste time.

887
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,710
Why are you still unchanged?

888
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,320
Were you staring at
your phone all this time?

889
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,350
I was just doing this and that.

890
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,860
He came to apologize.

891
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,260
Said he was sorry.

892
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,350
I thought this wouldn't bother you.

893
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,900
I never said it doesn't bother me.

894
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,770
How can it not bother me?

895
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,410
You're my girlfriend.

896
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,080
I think about you all the time.
It's crazy.

897
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,220
I'll leave now.

898
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,410
Get some rest.

899
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,690
Already?

900
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,020
I saw the face I wanted to see.
I should go.

901
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,630
Night.

902
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,910
That wasn't enough for me.
Stay for a while.

903
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,090
It's late. How long is a while?

904
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,950
I don't know.

905
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,987
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

906
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,510
<i>Just let go.</i>

907
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,410
<i>He said he's already moved on.</i>

908
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,030
<i>We shouldn't let things get further.</i>

909
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,400
<i>I'll die then.</i>

910
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,160
<i>Ma'am,</i>
