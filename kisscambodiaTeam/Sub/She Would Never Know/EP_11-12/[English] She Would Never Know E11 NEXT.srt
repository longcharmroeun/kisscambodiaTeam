EPISODE 11

3
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,889
Go in and get some sleep, Senior Yoon.

4
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,940
What about you?

5
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,050
I'm going to sleep in the car.

6
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,940
In the car?

7
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,750
Yes.

8
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,320
It's a bit small and uncomfortable,

9
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,950
but it's better for you
to get a good night's sleep.

10
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,750
But you know,

11
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,380
it's very cold today.

12
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,360
The weather app said it's -20°C,

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,320
but I feel like it's -40°C.

14
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,550
This is how you
freeze to death in your sleep.

15
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,450
It starts with the mouth.

16
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,670
Then...

17
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,630
Why don't you sleep in the tent?

18
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,150
Really?

19
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,120
I'll sleep in the car.

20
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,450
Oh, that's not...

21
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,690
Then...

22
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,960
How about we sleep in here together?

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,840
Sure.

24
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,180
Are you cold?

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,230
No.

26
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,300
You don't have to
address me professionally.

27
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,790
You can just call me by my name.

28
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,840
How should I call you then?

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,450
Song-ah. Like that?

30
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,850
Then address me comfortably too.

31
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,680
Hyun-seung.

32
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,079
How about I just call you Mr. Hyun-seung?

33
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,590
And I call you Ms. Song-ah?

34
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,350
That would be awkward.

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,110
Let's just do whatever feels natural.

36
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,030
This is how I sleep.

37
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,540
This is how I sleep.

38
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,840
I feel like I'm dreaming every day.

39
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,520
<i>Good morning.</i>

40
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,310
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

41
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,380
<i>I get to start my day with you.</i>

42
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,990
<i>I get to express my feelings for you.</i>

43
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,490
<i>I'm getting sleepy.</i>

44
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,930
Good night.

45
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,750
<i>Okay.</i>

46
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,250
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

47
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,350
Okay.

48
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,510
<i>I can look forward to starting
a new day with you.</i>

49
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,170
<i>I feel like I'm dreaming.</i>

50
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you know what I've been thinking?

51
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,130
That I'm lucky.

52
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,920
You're the one who knows
what I've been through.

53
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,110
When I finally realized how I felt,

54
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,560
you were still there waiting for me.

55
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,780
And the one who likes me this much

56
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,670
isn't just anyone.

57
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,060
He's the man looking at me right now.

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,160
So I feel lucky and thankful
for each moment.

59
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm happy that I'm with you.

60
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,430
Can I use your arm as my pillow?

61
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Good night.

62
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Good night.

63
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,380
<i>Wait. I'll change into
mourning clothes too.</i>

64
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,770
He's not worth your trouble.

65
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,560
You've taken a look at him, go home.

66
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,700
Go home. I'm going to get some rest.

67
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,400
That jerk.

68
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,760
Are you not going to dance, Hyo-joo?

69
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,360
Why are you drinking so much?

70
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,050
Is she upset about
her wedding getting postponed?

71
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,400
Are you leaving?

72
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,450
IDENTIFICATION CARD

73
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,950
LEE SE-DONG

74
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,179
HYO-JOO

75
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,720
<i>The receiver is unable to take the call.</i>

76
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,740
<i>Please leave a message…</i>

77
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,110
CHANMI'S DINER

78
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm sorry I can't stay till the evening.

79
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,350
Go eat something good.

80
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,980
You want me to pick you up
tomorrow morning?

81
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,420
How about a short early morning date?

82
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,110
I'll come to you.

83
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,050
I want to see you earlier too.

84
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,980
Get going now.

85
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,910
I don't want to go now.

86
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,840
I don't want to go.

87
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,070
I can't go now.

88
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,730
Stop it and go.

89
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,380
Design.

90
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,610
This one.

91
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,430
Start with the thumb.

92
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,580
Ooh, that's pretty.

93
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
You're home.

94
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,080
Yes.

95
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,400
You didn't go to work?

96
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,420
I will go soon.

97
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,350
What about you?

98
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,180
-Did you enjoy it?
-Huh?

99
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,260
I mean, did you enjoy the scenery?

100
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,270
Oh.

101
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Why?

102
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,390
You didn't get the chance to look around?

103
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,690
You know what?

104
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,680
The scenery was the last thing on my mind.

105
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,570
Hey, girl!

106
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,310
And you almost didn't give him a chance.

107
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,890
Well, I'm thankful I did.

108
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,480
Oh, by the way,

109
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,670
I'll be at the main shop
starting next week.

110
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,280
So suddenly? Why?

111
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,020
Because I'm the manager of that shop now.

112
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,390
I got promoted.

113
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,390
Really?

114
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,750
That's great! Congratulations!

115
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,750
Oh, my. I have to get to work.

116
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,870
I'm late.

117
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,190
Let's talk after I get back.

118
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,180
Yes, I just got here.

119
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,640
I'll go up and grab a table.

120
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,330
Long time no see.

121
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,630
How have you been?

122
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,750
You're back in Korea?

123
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,430
I have something to take care of.

124
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,720
What brings you here?

125
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,280
I'm meeting my siblings for lunch.

126
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,080
Ji-seung!

127
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,350
I should get going.

128
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,820
Enjoy your lunch.

129
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,960
<i>You ran into I-joon?</i>

130
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,420
Are you okay?

131
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
What's not to be okay about?

132
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,010
Years since he became her ex-fiance.

133
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,220
I was just a bit taken aback.

134
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,100
I hadn't seen him since then.

135
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,130
He looked the same
as he did a few years ago.

136
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,510
The life as a professor in the States
must be smooth.

137
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,950
Well, she's become more beautiful too.

138
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,480
Man.

139
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,540
What about me?

140
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,950
You're beautiful too.

141
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,810
Is he married?

142
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,530
I didn't ask.

143
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,910
I'm sure he is.

144
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,670
He's capable and nice.

145
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,540
It'd be weird if he isn't.

146
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,580
It'd be nice to have a husband
or boyfriend to show off.

147
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,570
You should've said
you were seeing your husband.

148
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,420
Nay.

149
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,530
-Hey.
-Why?

150
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,560
-Hey.
-Why?

151
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,270
Why would you make her lie like that?

152
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,090
It's better than being mortified.

153
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,550
I'm dating someone.

154
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,910
Yes, that's what you should've told him.

155
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,670
What was that?

156
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,690
What?

157
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,560
What?

158
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,560
Are you really seeing someone?

159
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,520
Really?

160
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,770
You're dating someone?

161
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
-Yes.
-Gosh!

162
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,820
-Who is it?
-Since when?

163
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,360
-How old is he?
-What does he do?

164
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,240
I'll tell you all about it later, okay?

165
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,390
-When?
-Hmm?

166
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,630
-Come on.
-Stop it.

167
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,030
-Come on.
-Attagirl.

168
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,120
You go, girl.

169
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,560
<i>I'm here.</i>

170
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,030
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

171
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,010
Senior Yoon.

172
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,330
Here.

173
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,900
Good morning.

174
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,660
Thank you.

175
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,490
Let's go.

176
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,550
It's the weather.
The weather is just great.

177
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,490
Are you going to be like this at work?

178
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,300
If you keep looking at me and smile,

179
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,850
everyone's going to find out about us.

180
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm not that great at
hiding my feelings, to be honest.

181
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,590
No can do.

182
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,850
I'll have to try harder
so we don't get caught.

183
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,650
Leave it to me.

184
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
Senior Yoon, this is yours.

185
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,920
-Thanks.
-You...

186
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,550
It's yours.

187
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,859
Coffee?

188
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,740
Hey, Hyun-seung.

189
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,220
Are you guys here for some coffee?

190
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,980
Yes.

191
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
I don't think I want any.

192
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay then. Please excuse me.

193
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,250
Enjoy your coffee.

194
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,720
Are they pretending
not to be in a relationship?

195
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,680
Seems like it.

196
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,630
They're trying too hard.

197
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,880
Let's pretend like we don't know anything.

198
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,140
You want some coffee?

199
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,550
I don't want any.

200
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,100
Have some coffee.

201
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,590
I have a favor to ask you.

202
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,370
Can you spare me a few minutes?

203
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,160
It's about the Renew Stick.

204
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,260
I was wondering which
foundation we can put in it.

205
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,720
What? Were you expecting something else?

206
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,130
What do you mean?

207
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,920
What are you talking about?

208
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,350
What would I expect?

209
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,940
Right, what would you expect though?

210
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,120
Hold on.

211
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,120
Were you expecting
a secret date or something?

212
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,150
Seriously.

213
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,440
So what?

214
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
You don't know which foundation to choose?

215
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,180
Did you talk with the lab?

216
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,610
They said any foundation will do.

217
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,850
But since it has to be applied
with a cotton swab,

218
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,080
I think a matte one
would be too irritating.

219
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,190
We should go with moist or semi-matte.

220
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,400
Let's test it first.
There's nothing better than that.

221
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,930
This is yours.

222
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,070
What do you think? Does it go on smoothly?

223
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,690
Yes. But...

224
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,090
Did I dab too much?

225
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,750
It feels a bit thick.

226
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,400
Here.

227
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,460
This is really convenient.

228
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,670
It removes makeup so easily.

229
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,050
I wish I could create
a successful product like this.

230
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,960
Your Renew Stick will do great.

231
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,150
You can do it.

232
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,480
Okay.

233
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,140
Can the lab take care
of the sealing issue?

234
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,810
This is different from oil products.

235
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,880
Product Planning will take care of that,

236
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,280
but I think it's doable.

237
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, Senior Yoon.

238
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,930
Let's go on a date after I wrap this up.

239
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,990
Hyun-seung.

240
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,840
Yes, sir.

241
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,320
I just heard it from Product Planning.

242
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,170
Seolyoon's preparing the Renew Stick too.

243
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,530
Why is Seolyoon doing it?

244
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,290
You didn't know, right? Just as I thought.

245
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,480
I can't believe those people.

246
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,640
Sir.

247
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,720
What is it?

248
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,320
Well...

249
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,310
Daejeon isn't meeting its quota again.

250
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,560
What's their sales department doing?

251
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,780
Are you releasing the Renew Stick?

252
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,110
Why do you ask?

253
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,980
Our team is planning on a solo release,

254
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,760
but I heard Seolyoon
is preparing that too.

255
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,610
We're different brands anyway.

256
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,570
What's the problem?

257
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,660
This is a multi-brand company.

258
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,200
When the lab develops something,

259
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,970
all the brands release their own version.

260
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,350
But this product is my idea,
not the lab's idea.

261
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,190
You're scheduled to release
next month as we are.

262
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,380
If you could, please postpone the release.

263
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,250
We're going to follow
our brand's timetable.

264
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,730
Chae Hyun-seung,

265
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,760
you're just an ABM.

266
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,750
You think you can order us around?

267
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,670
I know you're impudent,
but this is going too far.

268
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,100
Do I need to teach you a thing or two?

269
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,920
-What's going on?
-Sir.

270
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,630
It's about the Renew Stick.

271
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,840
He told me not to release it.

272
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,720
I was only asking
if you could adjust your timeline.

273
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,650
Look here, Chae Hyun-seung.

274
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,630
Don't tell me you're this naive.

275
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,450
You can't tell us what to do.

276
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,420
Is this a college group assignment?

277
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,150
You said you know when to butt in and out.

278
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,840
But you don't know when to shut up.

279
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,840
Stop wasting time,
and go get the shipment records.

280
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Yes, sir.

281
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll print that thing.

282
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,960
So we're asking you to meditate.

283
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,760
We can't come to a resolution on our own.

284
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,750
Hmm.

285
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,460
Does Seolyoon have to release it?

286
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,850
We haven't made a final decision.

287
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,670
We were just looking into some options

288
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,720
to meet our sales goal.

289
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,730
We did consider that it might affect KLAR,

290
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,720
but we are different brands anyway.

291
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,480
So I think it will be okay.

292
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,330
But it's not like
it won't negatively affect us.

293
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,620
This idea is a contest winner.

294
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,290
You could've discussed it
with the developer.

295
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,190
I would've done that
if we decided to release it.

296
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,650
But we're still reviewing that option.

297
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,790
Why are you making me the villain?

298
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,560
You're breaking my heart, Manager Kwon.

299
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,480
When's the release date again?

300
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,580
We're thinking of mid-December.

301
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,190
If we have a new release in December,

302
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,850
we can avoid negative growth this year.

303
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,820
ABM Chae Hyun-seung.

304
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,510
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,810
Is there no way
to release it with Seolyoon?

306
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,960
I know you want it to be
KLAR release only.

307
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,030
But BM Seo is right.

308
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,620
You're two different brands.

309
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,950
It's not like the Renew Stick
has a solid brand identity.

310
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,990
It can be released by more than one brand.

311
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,880
We'll release it together.

312
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:21,190
Keep me posted on the development process.

313
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,680
Later.

314
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,810
I want to give him some punches.

315
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,610
Sir.

316
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,640
BM Seo is unbelievable.

317
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,910
He really is deplorable.

318
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,560
Do you have to be like that to be a BM?

319
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,260
He only thinks about sales.

320
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,570
He lacks integrity
and business principles.

321
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,890
Someone like me can never be a BM.

322
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,770
Yoo-sun, don't worry.

323
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,070
With your temper,
you'll be the perfect BM.

324
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,420
You should go get a temper.

325
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,320
You could've protested
in front of the director,

326
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,080
or grab BM Seo by the collar.

327
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,010
I might get fired for that.

328
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,890
Will you keep food
on the table for my family?

329
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,580
If you say yes,
I'll go to BM Seo right now,

330
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,530
grab him by the collar
and punch him in the face.

331
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,360
Manager Kwon did more than enough for me.

332
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,130
I'm really okay.

333
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,160
Don't worry about me.

334
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,720
No way.

335
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,470
It's your first product.

336
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,510
You must feel as if your baby got stolen.

337
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,220
You won't be able to do it,

338
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,180
so we'll curse for you.

339
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,600
That fricking jerk!

340
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,460
She's right.
Get upset as much as you want.

341
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,850
And then put it all behind tomorrow.

342
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,630
You'll experience all sorts of
injustice at work.

343
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,280
He'll surely get his karma back.

344
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,900
Just shake it off.

345
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,990
What? I say nice words occasionally.

346
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,260
Do you want a drink?

347
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Oh, yes.

348
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,230
Awesome.

349
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,010
Why are you so warm-hearted suddenly?

350
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,690
I'm getting burned here.

351
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,690
Thank you.

352
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,710
If only we had our BM with us.

353
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,730
I mean the director. I wish he were here.

354
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,660
BM Seo wouldn't have
dreamed of pulling this.

355
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,350
There's no way he'd be able to.

356
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,020
The director is taking a very long break.

357
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,970
He's probably not returning anytime soon.

358
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,450
He barely used his leave days
because of work.

359
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,400
Anyway! Let's drink, Hyun-seung.

360
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,430
Cheers.

361
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,070
Thank you.

362
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,450
Excuse me. Passing through.

363
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,590
Thank you.

364
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,670
Excuse me. Passing through.

365
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,930
Excuse me. Passing through.

366
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,040
Hey, it's you.

367
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,040
Get up. I'll take you home.

368
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,840
This is the only way
to make you look at me.

369
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,430
Let's go.

370
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,280
Where to, sir?

371
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,580
To Director Lee Jae-woon's place, please.

372
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,990
Go to your place.

373
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,040
That's where I live now.

374
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,650
Right here.

375
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,880
Here.

376
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,530
Hyo-joo. Hey.

377
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,450
Darn it.

378
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,390
Why did she drink so much?

379
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,960
Was she with you?

380
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,450
I think she was with her friends.

381
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,090
Good lord.

382
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,760
Come on.

383
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,450
I'll go now.

384
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,670
Okay.

385
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,610
Why do you look so scrawny? Are you okay?

386
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,590
What's not to be okay about?

387
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,680
Knock it off.

388
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
Let me know if you need anything.

389
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,040
And also,

390
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
I know things are hard.

391
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,650
But don't leave Hyo-joo alone too much.

392
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,960
Goodbye.

393
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,270
Do you want me to scratch BM Seo's car?

394
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,420
Really?

395
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
Shall I?

396
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,710
Yes.

397
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,860
Really?

398
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,230
Give me a hug, please.

399
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Right now?

400
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,360
Okay. Come here.

401
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,520
I know you're very upset.

402
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,880
But don't be too broken up about it.

403
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,920
It means you thought of
a fantastic product.

404
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,510
Shake it all off,

405
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,100
and just have fun making it.

406
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,400
It gets really hectic,

407
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,800
but you'll have so much fun
once the product is out.

408
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,570
Let's just focus on the fun part.

409
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,920
Okay?

410
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,050
It's frustrating though.

411
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,730
I wish I could get back at him for this.

412
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,090
Don't go scratching his car.

413
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,060
Maybe I should puncture his tires too.

414
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,810
It's nothing.

415
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,930
What is it?

416
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,160
Well,

417
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,370
a thought crosses my mind.

418
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,520
What if the Renew Stick is a promotion,

419
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,770
and not a new release?

420
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,030
But it might be a waste of a good product.

421
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,560
I like it.

422
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,240
Really? You'd be okay with that?

423
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,880
Yes. I think it's a great idea.

424
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,420
Why didn't I ever think of that?

425
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,980
Impressive, Senior Yoon. You're the best!

426
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,910
I'm not your senior for nothing.

427
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,220
Hey now.

428
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,180
You're not my senior right now.

429
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,720
-You're my girlfriend.
-Hey!

430
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,500
Be careful.

431
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,770
-Are you scared?
-Yes, put me down!

432
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,290
Okay. I'll put you down but I need a kiss.

433
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
One more.

434
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,430
-Come on.
-Two kisses.

435
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,160
-Okay, then. Careful.
-Put me down now.

436
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,260
Stop.

437
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,220
Stop it.

438
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,960
You want me to stop?

439
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,960
Renew Stick as a promotional gift?

440
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,780
Yes, this is a niche product.

441
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,720
So instead of selling it right away,

442
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,750
it'll be good to test it
by giving it away as a freebie.

443
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,940
There are many parties
and events in December,

444
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,889
so it'll catch
the customers' attention too.

445
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,440
That makes sense.

446
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,059
Color makeup customers will love it.

447
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,760
Basic skincare, too.

448
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,369
Since the skin gets dry during winter,

449
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,170
they can carry it everywhere to apply.

450
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,210
It's a good idea,
but are you sure about that?

451
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,579
It's your first product.

452
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,920
Are you okay with it being a freebie?

453
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,539
If the customers like it,

454
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:48,139
we can release it later.

455
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,750
It's better than making
premature release and getting low sales.

456
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,990
I think it's better this way.

457
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,570
Okay then.

458
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,970
I'll talk to Director Lee Jae-shin.

459
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,639
Oh, right.

460
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,280
Go prepare all the new material codes.

461
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,099
Yes, sir.

462
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,740
That's a smart move.

463
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,630
How did you think of this?

464
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,099
BM Seo will completely lose it.

465
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,070
This is so satisfying.

466
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,570
I told you. He'll get his karma.

467
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,580
He's getting what he deserves.

468
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,040
I'm scared of you the most, Manager Kang.

469
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,870
Shall we wrap up?

470
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,030
Then proceed like that.

471
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,510
We'll talk about it more once I'm back.

472
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,550
Yes, sir. I'll let you know
if there are any changes.

473
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,430
Okay.

474
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,500
Come on in.

475
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,160
Will you be dining alone?

476
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,710
Yes.

477
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,360
Sit anywhere you like.

478
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,070
Min-sook, can you get his order?

479
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,650
Okay.

480
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,840
I'll take that.

481
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,580
What would you like to order?

482
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,250
One rice soup, please.

483
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,210
One rice soup.

484
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,810
That's all you're going to eat?

485
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,020
Eat some more.

486
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,220
I just need to wipe these dry.

487
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,670
Are you about 35 years old now?

488
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,230
Yes.

489
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,850
It's been, what, 22 years?

490
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,890
I thought it might
have been you last time.

491
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,960
So I called Yoo-mi's mom.

492
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,030
She told me you contacted her.

493
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,830
It was unexpected.

494
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,570
I didn't think you'd look for me.

495
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,640
Father passed away recently.

496
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,000
It was a car accident.

497
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,120
That's a relief.

498
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,830
That man is a waste of space.

499
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,850
He should've died a long time ago.

500
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,780
Did you come here to tell me that?

501
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
I just...

502
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,830
I wondered how you're doing.

503
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,130
Not much to it.

504
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,430
I was unlucky to begin with,

505
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,180
so nothing much changed.

506
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,020
This is as good as it gets.

507
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,840
I need to know.

508
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,870
Do you have any regrets?

509
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,500
This is much better.

510
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,930
Better than when I was
living with your father.

511
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,420
You look like you're doing okay.

512
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,660
You're always smart.

513
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,740
I guess you used it to your advantage.

514
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,170
Well done.

515
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,380
Come on in.

516
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,220
What would you like to order?

517
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,460
Two rice soups, please.

518
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,450
Okay.

519
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,640
Why did you come here?

520
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,880
Do you feel better
seeing me living like this?

521
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,160
You asked if I have any regrets?

522
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,310
I don't even regret abandoning you.

523
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,690
Don't come back here.

524
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,990
Consider me dead.

525
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,290
I've never needed you anyway.

526
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,380
A promotional gift?

527
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,930
That's a low move, Chae Hyun-seung.

528
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,080
You're making our products as freebies?

529
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,280
It's a new release.

530
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,910
Of course, when I reviewed this option,

531
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,500
I thought hard about
how this might affect Seolyoon.

532
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,660
Of course it'll affect us.

533
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,120
Just release it as a new product.

534
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,930
But then I got to thinking,
and you were right.

535
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,760
We are two different brands anyway.

536
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,400
You said that it would be okay.

537
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,630
So I think it will be alright.

538
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,250
But this is a different case.

539
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,330
If you give it out as a freebie,

540
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,520
how would that make us look?

541
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,430
We're not going to just give it out.

542
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,960
It'll only be given upon purchase.

543
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,840
Ahh, wait. Hyun-seung.

544
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,310
Is there something in my eye? It stings.

545
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,860
So then...

546
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,060
How will KLAR make up for sales
with no new release?

547
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,500
Oh, we're thinking of
an additional promotion.

548
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,150
I'll get that reported to you soon.

549
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,140
Director, this isn't right.

550
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,350
We need to boost sales.

551
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,090
We need to avoid negative growth.

552
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,150
Right. We don't want that.

553
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,910
-So then...
-So then,

554
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,940
you should get to thinking very hard.

555
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,400
If you want to keep your position,

556
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:40,020
what does Seolyoon need to do
to avoid negative growth?

557
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,700
I'm quite a reasonable person.

558
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,340
ABM Chae is just using
the same logic as you.

559
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,620
Isn't it?

560
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,890
Yes, sir.

561
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,050
ABM Chae Hyun-seung,

562
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,590
you're tenacious.

563
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,360
I mean it in a good way.

564
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,680
Thank you, sir.

565
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,990
A marketer must make
hard decisions about his product.

566
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,290
Your idea was great,
and you showed determination.

567
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,070
I received a lot of help with my idea.

568
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,700
From ABM Yoon Song-ah.

569
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,660
She was my trainer.

570
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,520
So you learned from the best.
It definitely shows.

571
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,680
It's such a shame.

572
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,820
Keep up the good work.

573
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,380
I'll be watching you.

574
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,400
Yes, sir.

575
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,700
I'm off.

576
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,350
See you tomorrow.

577
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,400
Bye.

578
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,490
You're making training samples again?

579
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,140
Yes, I want to get it out of the way.

580
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,060
There are so many
chores with color makeup.

581
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,620
New product every month,

582
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,120
new sample every month.

583
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,440
And it's not quick work either.

584
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,610
Can you help her, Hyun-seung?

585
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,070
Oh, I have a prior engagement.

586
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,470
It's easier if I do it alone.

587
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,060
I'll be heading out now.

588
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,790
I'm sorry I can't help.

589
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,660
It's fine.

590
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,350
Alright, Song-ah. See you tomorrow.

591
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,550
See you tomorrow.

592
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,350
You didn't leave?

593
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,290
So how many do you have to make?

594
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,930
I need 500 of them.

595
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,430
I'll put them in the container.

596
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,920
You close the lid.

597
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,680
Okay, I got this.

598
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,400
Let's wear an apron first.

599
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,090
Such a baby.

600
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,530
Here.

601
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,340
Done.

602
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,030
You need to wear one too.

603
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,310
I don't think I need one.

604
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,300
Nay.

605
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,070
If it gets on your clothes,

606
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,970
you won't be able to wash it off.

607
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:05,730
Come here.

608
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,470
Ahh, I don't need it.

609
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,270
Okay. How do you want it?

610
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,530
Pretty.

611
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,390
Pretty? A butterfly then.

612
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,020
Don't I look good in an apron?

613
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,210
-It's not a bad look.
-I'm a very good cook.

614
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,610
Oh, really?

615
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,600
Do you want me to show you?

616
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,640
Is this your way of trying
to get me to come over?

617
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,380
Yes.

618
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,060
Come on.

619
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,480
Focus on work for today, former trainee.

620
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,790
Right, we're at work.

621
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:41,540
Okay. Understood.

622
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,920
But when are you going to come over?

623
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,220
Come on, tell me.

624
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,170
Korean, Chinese or Western cuisine.

625
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,820
My Japanese cuisine isn't good enough.

626
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,450
Pick from Korean, Chinese or Western.

627
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,670
What the heck!

628
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,480
Gosh!

629
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,560
You're still here.

630
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,250
That's hilarious!

631
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,070
Totally unexpected, Manager Kwon.

632
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,140
You've turned KLAR upside down.

633
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,910
I told you it was 500.

634
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,960
I told you 500.

635
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,630
Hurry up if you want to get home tonight.

636
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,510
How is the food, Yeon-seung?

637
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,640
It's delicious.

638
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,020
You really know a lot about food.

639
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,880
I'm glad that you like it.

640
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,770
You're not eating much.

641
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,480
Isn't this the kind of food you like?

642
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,430
I'm eating.

643
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,560
Should I order something else for you?

644
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,560
No.

645
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,380
I know this is your favorite. Eat up.

646
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,380
Okay.

647
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,080
The empty seat next to you looks huge.

648
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,800
It'd be nice if someone
were sitting there.

649
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,950
What if I set you up with someone else?

650
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,870
You know anyone around you?

651
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,750
Of course not.

652
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,990
If you did, that would've
happened ages ago.

653
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,290
Oh, how about Nurse Kim?
Is she dating anyone?

654
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,660
He's fine on his own.

655
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,480
This is how he is.

656
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,420
He acts all unimpressed,

657
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,840
but he actually cares about you.

658
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,680
You know that, right?

659
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,730
Of course.

660
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,380
I'm used to it.

661
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,410
Right, you've been friends since college.

662
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,190
I'm glad my husband has a friend like you.

663
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,200
What were you two like in college?

664
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,320
I liked him.

665
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,620
I wanted to get close to him.

666
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,280
You know.

667
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,800
Some people just draw others in.

668
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,430
Oh? That's how he was?

669
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,900
Still, it wouldn't have been easy
to befriend him.

670
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,690
How did you get close?

671
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,670
Should I ask for dessert
if you're done with it?

672
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,210
-Already?
-We don't want to keep Ha-eun waiting.

673
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,610
We need to go home soon.

674
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,830
I'll ask for dessert.

675
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,390
Did something happen between you two?

676
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,760
You've never been talkative,
so that's fine.

677
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,150
But you abruptly ended dinner.

678
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,420
You barely ate too.

679
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,180
I'm just not feeling that well.

680
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,450
Why didn't you tell me?
We would've canceled it.

681
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,260
Is it bad?

682
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,630
I'm feeling better.

683
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,360
Can I turn on some music?

684
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,740
Go ahead.

685
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,580
Do you like it?

686
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,290
Isn't it great?

687
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,280
Everything's all set up.

688
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,080
We just need to bring in our stuff.

689
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,850
Let's move at the end of this week.

690
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,590
Why so sudden?

691
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,130
Aren't you going to stay
with me until I leave?

692
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,330
Because of you.

693
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,980
You're taking your father's passing
harder than I thought.

694
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,790
I figured a change of
environment might be good.

695
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,140
I also want to live
a newlywed life somewhere new.

696
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,890
You could've discussed it with me first.

697
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:54,430
How? You didn't even pick up the phone.

698
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,830
That won't happen anymore.

699
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,510
It's all over now.

700
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:02,510
You're doing this again.

701
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,410
You're always doing this.

702
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,290
You don't tell me about the problem.

703
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,810
You just say it's over.

704
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,640
I feel like I'm staring at a brick wall.

705
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,860
Do you know how frustrating it is?

706
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,370
Is it so hard for you to open up to me?

707
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,880
I'm the only one you've got now.

708
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,280
Let's not do this right now.

709
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,040
You're pushing me away again.

710
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,780
Then why did you tell me
you'll be better to begin with?

711
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,850
Why did you get my hopes up
and leave me in misery again?

712
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,720
How much more do I have to tolerate?

713
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,970
I didn't ask you to tolerate anything.

714
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,600
You know what we have isn't normal.

715
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,270
You know how we began.

716
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,790
You forced this on me
by attempting suicide.

717
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,240
What else could I have done?

718
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,420
If I hadn't done that,
you'd never look my way.

719
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,460
Since you agreed to this,

720
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,700
shouldn't you at least make an effort?

721
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,570
This is me making an effort!

722
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,740
But it's not enough for you,

723
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,600
so you keep driving me crazy.

724
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,240
When will you be satisfied?

725
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,880
What more do you want from me?

726
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,700
So I'm the only problem?

727
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,730
You're not at fault at all?

728
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,290
Then what do you want from me?

729
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,740
I forced this on you,

730
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,540
so I should shut up about it?

731
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,250
Should I just accept whatever you do?

732
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,120
That's not what I said!

733
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,940
That's exactly what you meant!

734
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,790
If this is your best effort,
then I don't need it.

735
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,830
I'm not a charity case.

736
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,820
If this is the best you can do,

737
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,570
let's just end it all then!

738
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,150
You really want to end it?

739
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:57,750
What?

740
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,530
Are you serious?

741
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,680
Is that really what you want?

742
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,920
Yes.

743
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,900
I can't do this anymore.

744
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,090
<i>My sister...</i>

745
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,250
<i>Can you please accept her?</i>

746
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,420
<i>She says she can't live without you.</i>

747
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:14,450
How are you feeling?

748
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,360
Jae-shin.

749
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,270
It's much better.

750
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,520
Thanks.

751
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,080
Did you get home okay yesterday?

752
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,900
I was worried I might have
made you uncomfortable.

753
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
I didn't want to ignore your wife,

754
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,660
and ended up saying that.

755
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,760
I didn't mean anything by it.

756
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,610
I see you because you're my friend.

757
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,230
Oh.

758
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,300
I want to make sure you feel the same way.

759
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,290
Sure, friend.

760
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,480
Take care of your wrist.

761
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,570
Guard it before it's damaged for good.

762
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,740
Yes.

763
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,520
Oh, I see.

764
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,330
Okay.

765
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,810
I'll check and get back to you right away.

766
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,790
Manager Kang?

767
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,790
I'm sorry.

768
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,490
It's about an event in Daejeon.

769
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,350
They're asking for
1,000 Aqua promotional gifts.

770
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,430
Can we do that?

771
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,240
Don't we have to check our inventory?

772
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,310
What do you think?

773
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,550
Umm...

774
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,530
We'll still have some stock left

775
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,660
even after we meet 120% of our target.

776
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,320
I think we can give them 1,000.

777
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:45,750
Do it then.

778
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,950
Okay.

779
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,440
You can decide that by yourself now.

780
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,300
Recent events tell me
you're more than capable.

781
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,010
Just keep me updated.

782
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,730
Okay. Thank you.

783
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,520
Our newbie is now all grown up.

784
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,180
You happy, Hyun-seung?

785
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,160
Bam!

786
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:18,280
Anyone want coffee? My treat.

787
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,110
Fantastic.

788
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,740
-Hot americano.
-Okay.

789
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,700
-Can I get something fancy?
-Sure you can.

790
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,930
Can I get two?

791
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:28,130
Two? Of course!

792
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,140
It seemed like
you were taking credit earlier.

793
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,370
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

794
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,040
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

795
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,530
LEE JAE-SHIN

796
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,120
<i>The caller's phone is turned off.</i>

797
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,870
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

798
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:26,070
Fresh coffee has arrived.

799
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,270
Coffee is here!

800
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,250
-Hot americano for me.
-Latte for me.

801
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,230
My latte.

802
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,960
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

803
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,510
This is yours.

804
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,720
Thank you.

805
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,200
Thanks for the coffee, Hyun-seung.

806
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,190
Enjoy.

807
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,240
It's so delicious.

808
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,710
I can drink their coffee every day
and not get sick of it.

809
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,060
This smells so good.

810
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,110
Doesn't it?

811
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,230
When did Director Lee Jae-shin stop by?

812
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,090
Today?

813
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,750
We didn't see him today.

814
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,950
I thought he's coming back tomorrow.

815
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,020
Is something wrong?

816
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,690
Nothing.

817
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,980
It seems urgent.

818
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,380
Did something happen?

819
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:35,686
JAE-WOON

820
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,400
What?

821
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,670
<i>Did something happen
between you and Jae-shin?</i>

822
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,540
Why?

823
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,220
Bye.

824
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,560
<i>The caller's phone is turned off.</i>

825
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,750
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

826
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,010
<i>After the tone...</i>

827
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,170
<i>If this is the best you can do,</i>

828
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,120
<i>let's just end it all then!</i>

829
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:51,080
Yes. I can't do this anymore.

830
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,960
JAE-SHIN

831
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,970
<i>The caller's phone is turned off.</i>

832
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,520
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

833
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:22,330
It's not every day we get off work
at the same time.

834
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:25,030
Right. This is very uncommon.

835
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:28,000
Shouldn't we grab a drink to celebrate?

836
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,510
You and your celebrations.

837
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,830
Go home and play with
your children for once.

838
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,450
It's not my problem.

839
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,910
They are too busy to play with me.

840
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:42,350
Nobody's down for dinner? I'm buying.

841
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:44,540
Enjoy it by yourself.

842
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,640
Manager Kang, how about some beef?

843
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,170
I have a date.

844
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,580
A date?

845
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,720
I don't understand
why you guys are rejecting me.

846
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,190
You'll buy us beef BBQ?

847
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,420
How about beef rice soup?

848
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,400
BBQ.

849
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,910
No BBQ.

850
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,440
I don't have the money.

851
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,460
Where is he?

852
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,320
Where is he?

853
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,020
Where is Lee Jae-shin?

854
01:02:03,328 --> 01:02:06,027
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

855
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,380
<i>He'll be our intern for a month.</i>

856
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,240
<i>His name is Ko Myung-jin.</i>

857
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,140
<i>I can show you.</i>

858
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:11,750
<i>It's okay.</i>

859
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:12,620
<i>Do you want to join us for lunch?</i>

860
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,710
<i>I'll eat by myself.</i>

861
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,620
<i>This is just for the experience.</i>

862
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,450
<i>So you don't need to train me.</i>

863
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:19,070
<i>Maybe they're having an affair.</i>

864
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,070
<i>An affair?</i>

865
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,740
<i>That's daring of her.</i>

866
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,490
<i>Director Lee Jae-shin and I were dating.</i>

867
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,740
<i>You can tell people that we are dating.</i>

868
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:29,660
<i>Do you have no self-respect?</i>

869
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,570
<i>Why are you giving yourself up for him?</i>

870
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,440
<i>Because I love him.
I can't live without Jae-shin.</i>

871
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,480
<i>She'll be too ashamed
to show her face here.</i>

872
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,630
<i>Have you thought about
working somewhere else?</i>

873
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,760
<i>You should take it.</i>
