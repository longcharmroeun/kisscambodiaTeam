00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,410
Sir,


4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,880
I need to go to the basement.


5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,270
Okay.


6
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,640
An announcement about the Europe Project
will be released soon.


7
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,680
Don't worry, your name isn't on the list.


8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,050
I'm running KLAR as well as
the Europe Project,


9
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,310
so we'll still run into each other.


10
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,319
But don't mind me.


11
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,150
Be patient for a couple of months.


12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,289
You don't have to mind me either.


13
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,789
I'm okay.


14
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,930
This will be the last time
we talk privately.


15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,070
Don't mention the past again.


16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Let bygones be bygones.


17
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,710
Don't worry.


18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,030
That's what I want too.


19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Okay.


20
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,820
Why are you two together?


21
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,140
Let's go, Senior Yoon.


22
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,290
You can go now.


23
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,690
You're busy. Get back to work.


24
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,430
Okay.


25
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,810
By the way,


26
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,730
what you said earlier...


27
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,660
Oh, that?


28
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,270
Actually, I saw her at the store before.


29
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,170
At the store?


30
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,030
Yes.


31
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,010
I thought she was a store employee.


32
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,110
When I saw you together,
I was surprised, so...


33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,620
Is she an HQ employee?


34
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,110
Is she your subordinate?


35
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,480
Yes, she's on my team.


36
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,500
Then who's the man?


37
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,890
Are they dating?


38
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,790
Yes.


39
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,400
I see.


40
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,470
They look good together.


41
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,970
I'll get going now.


42
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,410
Drive safely.


43
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,210
Okay.

[Episode 8]


45
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,070
I'm so tired.


46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
You must be tired, Manager Ahn.


47
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,210
I've prepared a piping hot cup of coffee.


48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Thank you.


49
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,350
-It's sweet and delicious.
-Right?


50
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,150
Call me whenever you're tired.


51
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,270
-Okay.
-Good.


52
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,360
This is so good.


53
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,970
So good.


54
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, my gosh. How can I carry this?


55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,570
It looks so heavy.


56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll carry it!


57
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,540
I'll carry it, Manager Ahn.


58
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,870
-Oh.
-It's heavy.


59
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,010
You don't have to do it.
It goes in the mailroom.


60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,680
Oh, the mailroom.


61
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,550
Hurry!


62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,750
Okay.


63
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,250
Song-ah?


64
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,230
You're leaving?


65
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes.


66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,270
Take care.


67
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,240
Hyun-seung!


68
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,740
Did something happen
between you and Manager Ahn?


69
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,040
Manager Ahn?


70
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,410
Did you make a mistake?


71
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,850
Why are you walking on eggshells
around her?


72
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,720
Nothing happened.


73
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,650
Really?


74
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,090
How far are you going to go?


75
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,200
Sorry. What I did back there...


76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,510
It's okay.


77
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,840
You don't have to make excuses.


78
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
You did it to help me.


79
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Senior Yoon...


80
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,220
You should go inside.


81
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,290
What about you?


82
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,290
I have an urgent business.


83
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,600
You go up first.


84
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay then.


85
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,170
-See you later.
-Okay.


86
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,590
I owe her something.


87
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,160
-You owe her?
-Yes, but...


88
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,790
The elevator door is closing.


89
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,330
Okay then.


90
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,050
-Don't work too late.
-I won't.


91
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,060
See you tomorrow.


92
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,850
Yikes!


93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,620
Manager Ahn!


94
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,980
How could I not know about that?


95
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,190
It's right before my eyes
and yet I couldn't tell.


96
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,909
My goodness! Your crush is Song...


97
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,990
No!


98
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,880
Manager Ahn!


99
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,000
Anyway, you're lucky I caught you.


100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,260
If it was someone else,


101
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,270
the entire company
would've been in an uproar.


102
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,270
If you need anything,
please tell me at any time.


103
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,540
You like her so much.


104
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,570
I feel sorry for you.


105
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm always rooting for you, Hyun-seung.


106
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,950
First floor!


107
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh!


108
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,250
First floor!


109
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,750
First floor.


110
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,090
Go for it!


111
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,590
Goodbye.

113
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,480
[So when are we going to meet?]


114
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,820
I didn't know I'd see you this soon.


115
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,710
I was just asking,


116
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,530
and you said you haven't had dinner.


117
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,300
But


118
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,770
you've hardly eaten anything.


119
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,440
Oh, right, I...


120
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,810
You don't have to force yourself.


121
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,310
You'll upset your stomach.


122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
Are you upset?


123
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,380
Because I lied about not having dinner?


124
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,250
I prefer a man who doesn't lie.


125
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,420
Okay, I'll never lie to you again.


126
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,060
Even if it's trivial.


127
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,730
Do you always try to
please other people like this?


128
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,230
No, I'm only doing it for you.


129
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,470
By the way,


130
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,340
what do you do?


131
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,740
I make clothes.


132
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,710
What kind of clothes?
There are so many kinds of them.


133
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,990
Wedding dresses.


134
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,880
I took over my mother's shop.


135
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,040
I see.


136
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,350
Too bad. If I had known earlier,


137
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,720
I'd ask you to make
my sister's wedding dress.


138
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,620
No, I'd better not.


139
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,730
Her temper is so...


140
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,460
I think I made a mistake.


141
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,000
What?


142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,390
A bad-tempered sister-in-law


143
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,160
is a turn-off, right?


144
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,740
This is only the first time
we're eating together.


145
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,950
You're right.


146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,830
Go on and eat.


147
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,580
I'll drink cold water and get a grip.


148
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,420
Excuse me! Can I get some cold water?


149
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,690
Right.


150
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,030
We don't know about each other's age yet.


151
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,560
I'm 37 years old.


152
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Two years apart then.


153
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,040
You're 39 years old?


154
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,170
Who?


155
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,380
Then...


156
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,950
35 years old?


157
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,650
Yes.


158
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,520
Huh?


159
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,620
Why are you flustered?


160
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,380
There's no reason for it.


161
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, I like this place.


162
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,400
But you don't like me?


163
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,880
Go away.


164
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,480
Hello? Where's the owner?


165
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,790
Get behind me.


166
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,390
Hi, sweetie. Why are you here alone?


167
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,460
Seung-ah!


168
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,930
I'm sorry, I lost my grip.


169
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,670
I'm sorry.


170
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,570
It's okay.


171
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,070
Goodbye!


172
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,290
Are you alright?


173
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,120
Oh, I...


174
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,020
I'm still scared.


175
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,660
There are so many dogs here.


176
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,020
Let's go.


177
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,340
This dish looks good.


178
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,610
So you can do it this way.


179
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,490
Are you watching something fun?


180
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,550
Huh?


181
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,690
Is it more fun than what I'm watching?


182
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,560
I want to watch too.


183
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,800
Are you really watching this?


184
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,940
Yes, I'm watching this.


185
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,410
It can't be.


186
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,040
It looked like it was so much fun.


187
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,440
Time for bed, Ha-eun!


188
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,980
Dad!


189
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,350
What are you working on so hard?


190
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,480
I told you.


191
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,740
Chef Ryu and I are
working on a cooking class.


192
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,590
I'm looking for references.


193
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,510
Take it easy. You must be tired.


194
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,020
Don't worry, I'll take care of myself.


195
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,920
Tuck Ha-eun in for me.


196
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,500
Right, Ha-eun.


197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,070
Good night, Mom!


198
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,100
Good night, sweetie!


199
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,170
Let's go.


200
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,950
Your uterine myoma has grown.


201
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,020
It's grown?


202
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
It used to be the same.


203
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,110
You said you've been
feeling pain recently?


204
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,120
And there's some bleeding?


205
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,190
I came because my lower belly hurt more.


206
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,390
It looks like


207
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,310
it's suddenly grown bigger recently.


208
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,230
It's a low chance,


209
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,810
but we should perform surgery
and take a biopsy of it.


210
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,250
Then is it...


211
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,280
Is it cancer?


212
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,040
[I can't say for sure.]


213
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
[Let's perform surgery first.]


214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
[Daughter]


215
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,290
Wait!


216
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
No...


217
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,570
[Recruiting New Marketers
for KLAR Cosmetics]


218
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,780
Senior Yoon! I'll do it.


219
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Will you?


220
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,080
Yes.


221
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,810
Thanks.


222
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,230
We're set to go, right?


223
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,100
Yes, I think so.


224
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,400
Wow, this place brings back memories.


225
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,270
It seems like only yesterday
I saw you here.


226
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Indeed.


227
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,710
It feels strange seeing you here.


228
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,410
I didn't know I'd see you again.


229
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,080
Thanks for what you did back then.


230
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,680
You brought me something to eat.


231
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,720
I was so hungry at that time,
I was about to go crazy.


232
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,990
I would've snapped off a desk leg
and gnawed it down.


233
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,460
A desk leg?


234
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,900
Oh, a desk leg.


235
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,600
I missed out on a good show.


236
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,470
Gnawing on a desk leg
sounds like a circus act.


237
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,740
You'll make this noise when you eat it.


238
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,460
A circus act?


239
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,980
Yes.


240
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,540
It's not too late.


241
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,210
Want me to snap off a desk leg
and beat you with it?


242
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,220
Come in, please.


243
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,790
Stop joking...


244
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,940
Hello.


245
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,560
You should've believed me.


246
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,390
Shut up.


247
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,020
-Sit here.
-Hi, please come in.


248
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,300
Come over here, please.


249
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,340
Oh, you brought your papers?


250
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,700
Read this carefully,


251
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,940
and ask me what you'd like to know.


252
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,109
This is my business card.


253
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,780
Thank you.


254
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,599
Read this carefully,


255
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,380
and take your time to ask me questions.


256
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,950
Okay.


257
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,980
Something good is going on?


258
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,829
Huh? Nothing.


259
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,329
Right!


260
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,870
You know about it, right?


261
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,640
About what?


262
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,540
Song-ah and Hyun-seung!


263
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,440
They are busted?


264
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,510
So busted.


265
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,080
If you know it, you should've told me.


266
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I almost set Hyun-seung
up on a blind date.


267
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,580
How could I? They are dating secretly.


268
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,490
Dating? What do you mean?


269
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,790
You said you know.


270
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,690
I do.


271
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,390
About Hyun-seung's crush.


272
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,000
What?


273
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,590
It's a crush?


274
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,870
They're dating?


275
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,900
Aren't they flirting?


276
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,310
Crush.


277
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,640
Aren't they dating?


278
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,810
Flirting?


279
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,120
I can't believe the first day
is so hectic this year.


280
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,850
It's not usually like this, right?


281
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,110
Usually, the last day is the busiest day.


282
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,390
What about lunch? Where should we go?


283
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,430
Have you been to the cafeteria?


284
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,400
No. Is it good?


285
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,700
Not bad. Let's go there.


286
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,430
Okay.


287
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,240
This way.


288
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,950
Chae Hyun-seung!


289
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,550
It's really you.


290
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,790
Long time no see.


291
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,890
Yes, it's been a while.


292
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,730
What are you doing here?


293
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,770
Are you here for the campus recruiting?


294
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,600
Yes.


295
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,570
Me too.


296
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,160
I'll go on ahead.


297
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,410
No, Senior Yoon.


298
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,780
Let's go together.


299
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,580
We're going somewhere.


300
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,220
Sorry. See you when the day's over.


301
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
You're at KLAR, right? I'll go find you.


302
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,620
I have other plans.


303
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,230
I'll get going now.


304
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,960
Let's go, Senior Yoon.


305
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,670
Why are we here?


306
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,320
I told you.


307
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,450
You'll have to carefully
watch your actions.


308
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,790
And that includes what you wear.


309
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,560
I picked out the clothes
that will suit you well.


310
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,200
And they will become
your taste after this.


311
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,000
Let's begin.


312
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,790
This one.


313
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,500
Yes, sir.


314
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,400
You look better than I expected.


315
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,350
Thanks for today.


316
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,930
Don't be.


317
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,400
To some extent, I'm putting
shackles on you.


318
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,200
You'll be criticized non-stop
about your conduct.


319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,610
About what you must do
and must not do in our family.


320
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,420
By the way, how's your dad?


321
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,080
He hasn't called you yet?


322
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,840
If he sees your marriage announcement,


323
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,590
he'll come to you soon.


324
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,990
Don't worry. That won't happen.


325
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,120
You met him already?


326
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,550
As a courtesy to join your family,


327
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,190
I've taken care of him.


328
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,070
Good job.


329
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,310
We're here.


330
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,680
Can I really go?


331
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,780
They're your friends from college.


332
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,550
The junior we met earlier
told you to come.


333
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,920
Don't be so nervous.


334
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,290
The owner here is our senior.


335
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,360
Everyone is friendly and fun.


336
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,130
It'll be fine.


337
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,350
Since I'm already here,


338
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,630
should I join for a while?


339
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,330
Sure.


340
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,840
Okay.


341
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,450
Strawberries, go!


342
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,640
I like strawberries!


343
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,310
Strawberries!


344
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,410
Strawberries!


345
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,540
I'm here!


346
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,650
-Hey!
-Hyun-seung!


347
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,620
Why has it been so long?


348
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,190
-Hey!
-Long time no see!


349
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,360
-Sorry. It's been a while.
-Remember me?


350
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,620
Of course, I remember you.


351
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,330
Where should we sit?


352
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,160
-Over here.
-Okay.


353
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,580
Move over. Here.


354
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,130
Thanks.


355
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,430
Sit here.


356
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,950
-Okay.
-Thank you.


357
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,580
You got lucky with food.
You're here just in time.


358
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,550
Is this the senior
you've been talking about?


359
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,050
Yes.


360
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,520
Say hi.


361
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,620
This is the owner I told you about.


362
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,720
Oh, hello...


363
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,320
Sit down.


364
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,390
Oh, okay.


365
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,190
Hello, I'm Yoon Song-ah.
I work with Hyun-seung.


366
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,930
Nice to meet you.


367
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm this fool's senior, Kim Jong-hyuk.


368
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,770
You must've gone through a lot
training this fool.


369
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,840
Hyun-seung is really good at his job,


370
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,560
so I receive a lot of help.


371
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,530
You're so kind.


372
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,010
How did you end up with this idiot?


373
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,980
Oh, come on.


374
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,280
What did you say? You need more soju?


375
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,020
Yes!


376
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,770
More soju?


377
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,520
Yes!


378
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,390
Soju!


379
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,390
Hey, guys!


380
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,590
Eat whatever you like today.


381
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,030
Hyun-seung is buying everything!


382
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,700
Ready, go!


383
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,470
Chae Hyun-seung!


384
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,170
Seriously, guys...


385
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,870
Hye-jung's voice wasn't loud enough.


386
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,380
Chae Hyun-seung!


387
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,420
Unemployed, alright.


388
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,050
Here come the drinks!


389
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,990
One here.


390
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,860
I'll pour you one.


391
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,680
-Hyun-seung.
-Yes?


392
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,700
How's work? Is it fun?


393
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,760
Work?


394
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,830
It's fun. The office vibe is good.


395
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,440
And there are a lot of
good seniors like her.


396
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,210
Wow, you know how to
lead a good social life!


397
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,510
What about making products?


398
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,340
Can you really make whatever you want?


399
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,440
Not really.


400
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,080
But things do go as marketers plan them.


401
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,250
From product planning
to the container and design,


402
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,820
we control everything.


403
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,620
Hyun-seung, what's the
best cushion foundation?


404
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,390
Of course it's KLAR.


405
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,560
-Oh, my bad.
-Come on.


406
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,860
By the way, are you wearing makeup?


407
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,830
Yes.


408
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,330
He's unbelievable, Hyun-seung.


409
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,390
He always wears makeup, even during tests.


410
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,470
Great self-discipline.


411
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,570
Hey! It's about my pride.


412
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,560
Of course it is.


413
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,910
You really...


414
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,180
Senior Yoon,


415
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,350
can I have your business card?


416
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,650
My business card?


417
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,280
I want to go to KLAR too.


418
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,290
I want to ask you a bunch of questions.


419
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,460
Hey, shouldn't the order go like this?


420
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,860
Come on, you're still a newbie.


421
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,960
If I have questions,
she'd answer me better.


422
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,930
So move over, please.


423
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,230
Can I have your business card?


424
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,900
Sure, I'll give it to you.


425
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,100
He seized his chance.


426
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,210
I'm so embarrassed.


427
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,070
Thank you.


428
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,480
Can I have one too?


429
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Of course.


430
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,710
If you have any questions,
contact me anytime.


431
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,420
Really? Thank you.


432
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,280
Me too...


433
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,890
No, I'm not drunk!


434
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,260
One, two, three, four!


435
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,830
Orange, orange, oh!


436
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,600
Orange, orange, oh!


437
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,230
-Who?
-Why didn't you catch it?


438
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Me?


439
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,740
Drink! Here goes the shot!


440
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,310
Isn't this too much?


441
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,410
Gulp it down!


442
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,240
Don't sneak away, drink it already!


443
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,450
Rice cake, four.


444
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,880
Rice cake.


445
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,720
Fish cake, eight.


446
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,390
Fish cake!


447
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,120
Okay!


448
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,560
Tuna, tuna...


449
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,580
-No.
-You have to drink.


450
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,150
Come on. Seriously.


451
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,460
Get used to this.


452
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,130
They'll give you a lot of help
from now onward.


453
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,980
Sorry for being late.


454
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,220
This is Jae-shin,
the one I told you about.


455
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,690
Come in.


456
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,830
The sky is spinning in circles.


457
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,700
I think I'm going to die.


458
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,440
Don't worry. People won't die that easily.


459
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,940
No, I mean it.


460
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,100
It's your fault you suck at games.


461
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,110
You slipped and lost every time.


462
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,680
You're too good at it.


463
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,910
You said it was your first time playing,


464
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,090
and yet you never lost.


465
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,390
You didn't even offer to drink for me.


466
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,990
Don't you know my motto?


467
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
When training juniors...


468
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,770
You raise them to be strong.


469
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,140
But this is too much, isn't it?


470
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,470
Are you feeling that bad?


471
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,740
I think I'll be okay in a little while.


472
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,380
You should go home.


473
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,350
And hear later that you die on the street?


474
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,720
I knew it.


475
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,920
You're the best.


476
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
Get some rest.


477
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,090
Okay.


478
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,730
You must've had a really fun college life.


479
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,670
I guess.


480
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,070
What about you?


481
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,010
It was hard enough just to attend classes.


482
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,780
I tutored kids, worked part-time jobs...


483
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,640
I had no time to make friends,


484
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,620
let alone join club activities.


485
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,430
I wanted to be independent,
so don't feel bad.


486
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,570
Anyway, seeing you today made me jealous.


487
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,710
A college life like that
would've been fun.


488
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,880
And it was different seeing you
as someone else's senior.


489
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,050
I was cool, right?


490
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,810
Yes.


491
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,560
I'll invite you again some time.


492
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,220
I'll invite you anytime, so please come.


493
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,510
The door is wide open.


494
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,050
I think you've sobered up now. Let's go.


495
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,910
Okay.


496
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,890
What's wrong?


497
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
You okay?


498
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,980
No.


499
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,310
Five minutes.


500
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,980
Just stay like this for five minutes.


501
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,980
Who are you?


502
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,200
[Family Relation Certificate]


503
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,860
So you're Jae-shin's father?


504
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,810
Oh, yes.


505
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,780
As it says there, I'm Jae-shin's father.


506
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,920
He's a spitting image of me.


507
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,840
So,


508
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,320
have you heard about me from him?


509
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,260
I only know you exist.


510
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,330
He doesn't like me that much.


511
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,820
I guess that's how it is
between every father and son.


512
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,030
By the way, you're very lovely.


513
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,470
My son has great taste in women,
just like his old man.


514
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,680
How did you find me here?


515
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,850
Well...


516
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,580
The wedding announcement
was huge in the news.


517
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I did a little digging.
It was easy to find.


518
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,860
I don't have an ulterior motive.


519
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,220
You'll be joining our family now.


520
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,560
I should see you at least once.


521
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,760
It'll be weird to see you
for the first time at the wedding.


522
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,600
You're coming to our wedding?


523
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,670
Of course, I am.


524
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,640
It's my one and only son's wedding.


525
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,370
But don't worry.


526
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,810
I look shabby today
because I was in a rush.


527
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:19,010
But if I clean myself up,
I'd look like a movie star.


528
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,380
In order to do that,


529
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,560
I need some money.


530
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,460
Oh, where are you going to live?


531
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
How much do you want?


532
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,300
How much?


533
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,370
Tell me.


534
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,900
Come on.


535
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,870
That's not why I come.


536
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,820
I guess I should consider your position.


537
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,620
And I am sort of badly-off these days.


538
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,940
One big one...


539
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,010
No,


540
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,930
two big ones will do.


541
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,730
Why should I?


542
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,440
Huh?


543
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,100
Do I seem


544
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,010
like a pushover to you?


545
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,949
No...


546
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,540
Since my daughter-in-law
dutifully offered first...


547
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,840
I told you I didn't come to get anything!


548
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,719
So you don't need the money?


549
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,310
Oh, thank you!


550
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,620
It was inconvenient for me all day
because I lost this.


551
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,450
You're an office worker.


552
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,920
How could you lose your employee card?


553
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,480
You're a newbie and yet
you're already laid-back.


554
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,090
I've been working long enough
to be laid-back.


555
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,770
How confident.


556
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,360
-The food's here.
-Here's your food.


557
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,190
Thank you.


558
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,670
Looks good.


559
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,460
Thank you.


560
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,270
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.


561
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,910
My stomach is burning.


562
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,980
You're still very young.


563
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,710
When I was your age,
I drank a crate of soju...


564
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,900
Yes, I know.


565
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,450
You drank a crate of soju
and a crate of beer


566
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,720
but you felt nothing.


567
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,920
I know it all.


568
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,760
Slick as a whistle.


569
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,590
You pretended to be cool
in front of that senior of yours.


570
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,390
Did I?


571
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,130
You like her, don't you?


572
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,870
What are you talking about?


573
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,900
I knew it! I'm right!


574
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,100
It's so obvious. How can she not know?


575
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,040
Is it that obvious?


576
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,080
Geez.


577
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,610
Just tell her.


578
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,370
I should be more careful.


579
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,390
So that I can be around her.


580
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,760
Hey.


581
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,560
Why the sudden sad vibe?


582
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,870
We'll first knead the dough
for buckwheat noodles.


583
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,400
First, put in buckwheat flour.


584
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,040
We also use hard wheat flour.


585
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,410
Kneading with hot water
is called scalding.


586
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,710
You use this method to make thin noodles.


587
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,920
Scrub the buckwheat noodles
as hard as you can.


588
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,660
Remove the starch to get a chewy texture.


589
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,360
Oh, this is sesame oil.


590
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,110
They are edible flowers.


591
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,090
Would you like to try it?


592
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,050
Is it good?


593
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,090
It's really good.


594
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,190
Is it?


595
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,270
You're right.


596
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,040
Your cooking is better though.


597
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
I agree.


598
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,110
You two must be together.


599
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,880
What?


600
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
You're not?


601
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,850
You seem close.


602
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,310
Oh, no. We're...


603
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,320
Friends.


604
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,190
Just close friends.


605
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,660
Oh, I see. Good for you guys.


606
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,530
You can come to places like this.
I envy you.


607
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,830
It's good to have a friend.


608
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,540
Thank you for today.


609
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,510
I learned a lot.


610
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,610
That's good.


611
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,480
You'll do it then?


612
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,150
Yes. I'll check my schedule
and let you know.


613
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,050
Oh, and...


614
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,780
Sorry about earlier.


615
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,220
I went ahead and said we were friends.


616
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,150
If I said I was your husband's friend,


617
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,390
she'd look at us in a funny way.


618
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,290
Come to think of it, that's possible.


619
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,350
You have a lot of friends, don't you?


620
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,060
I do.


621
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,400
But what's the use?


622
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,270
They're all married
and busy raising their kids.


623
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,340
I got married early.


624
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,730
I was busy raising Ha-eun,


625
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,840
so I couldn't see them.


626
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,180
Now, it's the opposite.


627
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,170
I know all the moms of Ha-eun's friends.


628
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,780
But they are different from my friends.


629
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,950
I guess you're right.


630
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,850
What about you? Do you have many friends?


631
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,690
Not really, I only have Woo-hyun.


632
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,290
It's sad, right?


633
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,350
What's wrong with that?


634
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,960
My husband is the same too.


635
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,030
You're peas in a pod.


636
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,630
By the way, how did you two
become friends?


637
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,070
Oh, about that...


638
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,810
What is it?


639
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,120
[Pick up Ha-eun for
nature experience class]


640
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,490
Sorry, I have to go to my next schedule.


641
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,550
Sure.


642
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,760
-I'll see you next time.
-Bye.


643
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,840
Doctor, that was the last patient.


644
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,100
Okay, well done today.


645
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,960
[Han-seo]


646
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,530
Over here!


647
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,470
That was quick.


648
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,940
We were wrapping up.


649
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,640
Your restaurant?


650
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,870
It's my day off.


651
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,820
You're hosting a cooking class
with my wife?


652
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,060
Yes, I'm going to give it a go.


653
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,130
It's boring managing the restaurant.


654
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,530
It's good that your place
is doing well so quickly.


655
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,400
Has it been six months now?


656
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,900
Yes.


657
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,240
Around that.


658
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,520
Should I prepare what Manager Kwon
asked by tomorrow?


659
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,390
Yes.


660
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,980
You're leaving now?


661
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,990
Yes.


662
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,230
You're getting off work late.


663
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,640
Why are you here?


664
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,010
You didn't answer my texts.


665
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,800
There was no reason to answer.


666
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,490
You're still very angry.


667
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,780
Let's go, Senior Yoon.


668
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,690
I'll keep coming.


669
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,400
Until you agree to meet me.


670
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,580
So?


671
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,950
What do you want to say?


672
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,980
Who was that woman?


673
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,950
Your girlfriend?


674
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,730
It's so strange.


675
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,560
That you're looking at me like this.


676
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,220
If you don't have anything
to say in particular,


677
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,630
I'll leave now.


678
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,160
I miss you so much.


679
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,810
Did you ever think about me?


680
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,720
I know I'm being shameless.


681
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,860
Acting like this after what I did to you.


682
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,920
I thought I made myself clear.


683
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,590
When I say it's the last time,
it's really the last time.


684
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,530
But you still chose him.


685
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,900
I was young.


686
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,800
That's why I preferred someone
who shared the pain.


687
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,370
But in reality, it wore me down.


688
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,740
You always said it'd be fine.


689
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,980
That everything would be alright.
And I missed that.


690
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,980
You're the one


691
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,290
that I really need.


692
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,250
Seo-yeon,


693
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,770
you can't do this.


694
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,790
You can't win or discard people
based on your needs.


695
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,590
Also, there's someone I like.


696
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,130
I like her a lot.


697
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,970
Who?


698
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,370
That woman?


699
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,310
Yes.


700
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,600
What about her?


701
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,050
Does she feel the same way?


702
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,250
The important thing is
I'm not going back to you.


703
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,020
Just accept my feelings then.


704
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,860
I can't give up on my feelings
just because you like her.


705
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,790
When you grow weary of your crush,


706
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,600
you'll look at me one day, right?


707
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,300
I won't become weary.


708
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,530
Even if we get further apart,


709
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,630
I still won't become weary.


710
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,370
Then I'll keep my eyes fixed on you too.


711
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,310
I don't think I'll become weary either.


712
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,210
Don't you think that's an obsession?


713
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,840
It seems to me that we're the same.


714
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
You and I.


715
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,080
Unrequited love is nothing more
than a selfish thought.


716
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,680
[She's got a lot of nerve! How shameless!]


717
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,260
What a jerk.


718
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,870
[She's talking a load of trash!
Ignore her!]


719
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,120
But it's not that easy.


720
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,270
[Of course, it'll trouble your mind.]


721
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,070
You said you won't be greedy,


722
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,710
but you can't control your feelings.


723
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,940
But still, there's a way.


724
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,210
[Keep your feelings
to yourself till the end.]


725
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,250
[Because you want to stay by her side.]


726
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,960
It'll be hard to keep hiding it.


727
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,840
[Geez.]


728
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,450
[I'm tearing up.]


729
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,460
[Anyway, Little Brother.]


730
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,420
[I'll call you Little Brother, okay?]


731
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,430
[From now on, just focus on
your feelings.]


732
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,400
[Don't look at anything around you.]


733
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,670
[Just look at your heart.]


734
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,600
Okay?


735
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,170
Keep that in mind!


736
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,010
[I've been through it.]


737
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,990
[The same thing as you.]


738
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,940
I pretended I didn't know.


739
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,090
I held out, pleading and begging.


740
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,330
That's what I did.


741
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,000
[But do you know how it ended?]


742
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,000
[She dumped me in the end.]


743
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:15,520
[Unrequited love is nothing more
than a selfish thought.]


744
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,530
[Senior Yoon Song-ah]


745
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,560
[Are you alright?]


746
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,770
Have you been talking all night


747
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,420
without having dinner?


748
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,840
We didn't talk that long.


749
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,730
That woman


750
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,800
is the girl you mentioned before, right?


751
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,300
Is she asking you to get back together?


752
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,780
You read my mind.


753
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,750
It's obvious.


754
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,710
She came to the office
because you ignored her texts.


755
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,090
These people always do that.


756
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,350
They tear you into pieces


757
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,140
and leave you for someone else.


758
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,990
Then, they come back
as though nothing's happened.


759
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,730
It's more appalling that they think
they can undo what's happened.


760
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,300
You must be upset.


761
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,040
Not that much.


762
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,240
Don't lie.


763
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,410
Your face says otherwise.


764
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,280
It's okay.


765
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,120
I used to be such a mess in front of you.


766
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,190
Did something else happen?


767
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:58,930
Are you worried?


768
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,000
Of course.


769
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,200
Why?


770
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
What do you mean why?


771
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,750
Because you're a junior that I value.


772
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,920
Senior Yoon.


773
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,860
Yes? Talk to me.


774
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,830
The more I think about it,


775
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,200
the more I realize I'm being too greedy.


776
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,620
I still like you a lot.


777
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,280
I don't want to
keep the distance I promised.


778
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,650
I was lying.


779
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,890
I want to stay by your side
even if it's like this.


780
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,930
I was going to hide my feelings,


781
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,160
but it'll come out eventually.


782
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,160
Then you'll be shocked again


783
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,450
and feel sorry for me.


784
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,540
I'll become a burden to you.


785
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,050
I don't want to see you like that again.


786
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,520
So I'm going to give you up.


787
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,190
I'll try to become distant from you.


788
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,600
When you say no, it means no.


789
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:51,440
So don't be surprised if I seem different.


790
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,710
And don't be hurt.


791
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,850
I can't be the same as before.


792
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,290
All my friends say you're awesome.


793
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,220
They're asking if you can set them up
with your friends.


794
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,230
There's only Jae-woon.


795
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,530
There's no one then.


796
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,100
I need to keep my conscience clear.


797
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,570
Thanks.


798
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,700
For meeting up with my friends.


799
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,540
By the way, I met your father
earlier today.


800
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,070
My father?


801
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,450
Yes. He came to my studio.


802
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,920
He saw our wedding article.


803
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,340
I think he came to me
because he was afraid to go to you.


804
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,450
What did he say?


805
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,720
Seemed like he can barely make ends meet.


806
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,090
Why didn't you call me?


807
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,540
I thought about it,


808
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,450
but I didn't want to stress you out.


809
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,830
I took care of him.


810
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,830
He's no longer my father.


811
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,170
So don't give him money ever again.


812
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,110
Don't even talk to him.


813
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,010
Did I make a mistake?


814
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,870
[So I'm going to give you up.]


815
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
I'll try to become distant from you.


816
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,810
Iced Americano with two shots of espresso


817
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,550
and two pumps of vanilla syrup.


818
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,950
Okay.


819
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,720
Oh! Song-ah!


820
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,990
Oh, hello.


821
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,200
You're here alone?


822
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,130
Yes.


823
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,370
When will they send
the new eyeshadow sample?


824
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:42,270
They said within this week,
but I'll check again.


825
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,500
Okay.


826
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,910
By the way,


827
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,440
Hyun-seung's new product idea is great.


828
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,410
The team leader pulled out a list.


829
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,180
Hyun-seung is on the presentation list.


830
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,180
Really?


831
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,650
The official email will be sent tomorrow,


832
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,120
but you can tell him in advance.


833
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,090
Okay.


834
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,860
How do you feel?


835
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,040
I knew you'd make the PowerPoint list.


836
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,780
All that's left is the first place.


837
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,110
I'll do my best.


838
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,680
What do you mean?


839
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,300
You'll win first place
even without doing your best.


840
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,720
What are you doing there, Song-ah?


841
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:35,420
Song-ah,


842
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,180
Hyun-seung made the presentation list.


843
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,060
Congratulations. You worked hard.


844
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,530
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.


845
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,970
Come on.


846
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,570
Let's go out for drinks.


847
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,500
To wish for first place.
What do you think?


848
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,240
I'm in.


849
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,740
Of course, you are.


850
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,410
How about you?


851
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,180
Sure.


852
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,440
Of course, you're the hero.


853
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,980
What do you want to eat?


854
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,850
Anything's fine.


855
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,680
We should go where you want to go.


856
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,020
Cheers!


857
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,300
Wow! This is so good!


858
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:22,070
You must order makgeolli
and pajeon on rainy days.


859
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:24,910
You used Hyun-seung
as an excuse to drink, right?


860
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,440
Kind of.


861
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,770
It's a good day to drink together.


862
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,380
I'll order fried pepper.


863
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,750
Ma'am, fried pepper
and assorted jeon, please!


864
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,620
Okay.


865
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,390
Do you want anything?


866
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,920
No, you ordered everything.


867
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,760
I'll just eat that.


868
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,130
I wanted beef jeon though.


869
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,400
Why are you feeling down?


870
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,460
Just drink.


871
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,900
Yes, let's drink.


872
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,970
-You're very tactful.
-Of course.


873
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:53,940
Okay.


874
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,960
No one is going home early, okay?


875
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,140
No one will go.


876
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,140
Hyun-seung!


877
00:55:59,140 --> 00:55:59,740
First place!


878
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,610
Go for it!


879
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,130
Go for it!


880
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,580
Listen to the sound of rain.


881
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,620
I hope the food comes soon.


882
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,960
Cheers!


883
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,830
I knew it.


884
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,100
He can't hold his liquor.


885
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,000
Where is Song-ah anyway?


886
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,270
Why don't you go look for her, Hyun-seung?


887
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,940
Yes, you should go.


888
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,750
The youngest one should step up.


889
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,650
Okay, I'll go look for her then.


890
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,920
I told you it's a crush.


891
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,490
They're flirting.


892
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,060
I said they're dating.


893
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,630
I heard it with my own ears.


894
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,830
I saw it with my own eyes.


895
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,330
They held hands and ran.


896
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,400
They held hands again?


897
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Again? When?


898
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,130
Geez! What is this?


899
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,430
I got it.


900
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,340
Today,


901
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,870
no one is leaving early.


902
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,210
We'll go to work in the morning.


903
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,180
Go back to sleep.


904
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,510
Sleep well, Manager Kwon.


905
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,180
It started in Samcheok.


906
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,820
It doesn't make sense
if they're still not dating.


907
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,950
Maybe the crush became a relationship,


908
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,190
then they broke up


909
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,460
and now they're flirting.


910
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,690
Geez! What is it?


911
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,320
Seriously.


912
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,660
Relationships are so complicated.


913
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,000
I give up.


914
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,560
-They're flirting.
-Go back to sleep.


915
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,960
Are you okay?


916
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:56,990
Yes.


917
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,060
What about you?


918
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,430
Me too.


919
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,850
I'll go back inside.


920
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,680
Okay.


921
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,170
Oh...


922
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:45,910
I'm sorry.


923
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,880
It's okay.


924
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,250
I'm going in now.


925
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,250
Okay.


926
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,550
First, the selling points of Aqua Cushion.


927
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,190
There are two things you need to remember.


928
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,260
Triple functional cosmetics.


929
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,130
Dermatologically tested
for sensitive skin.


930
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,360
Remember these two aspects.


931
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,390
Specifically, it brightens the skin,
treats wrinkles


932
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,040
and blocks UV rays.
It has three functions.


933
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,400
Take note of that.


934
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,470
It's best for those who want to moisturize


935
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,510
and those who want
a skin-lightening effect...


936
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,240
Hi.


937
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,780
Hello.


938
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,680
Where is Manager Ahn?


939
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,850
She'll be here later.


940
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,950
The previous training session
hasn't ended yet.


941
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,780
Wait in the next lecture room,
I'll call for you.


942
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,640
Okay.


943
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,860
Inflacin X that helps soothe the skin...


944
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,340
You're here.


945
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,450
Where's Manager Ahn?


946
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,590
She went to solve issues
with the new product.


947
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:37,750
Oh.


948
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,650
Is it serious?


949
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,720
One of the materials for the container
is running late.


950
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,410
How is it going with your presentation?


951
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:07,980
Good.


952
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:26,030
[Training Team Manager Kim So-min]


953
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:26,030
[You can come in five minutes later.]


954
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,630
If I don't like this,


955
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,490
I become the bad person, is it?


956
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,320
I can't ask you if you need any help.


957
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,230
We can't laugh together anymore.


958
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,500
I can't even look at you in the eyes.


959
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,340
I don't like this.


960
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,770
I'm the bad person, right?


961
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,300
Even so,


962
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,120
I'll just be the bad person.


963
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,250
So don't give up.


964
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,590
Don't become distant


965
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,150
from me.
