1
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:15,890
ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,330
Sorry. I dozed off.

3
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,330
Get some sleep.

4
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
We did a lot already.

5
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,170
But there's still a lot left.

6
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,810
I'm awake now.

7
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,220
No, stop.

8
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,039
Just get some kip.

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,479
You can barely keep your eyes open.

10
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,420
I usually go to bed early.

11
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,880
Lie down for half an hour.

12
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,950
Don't worry, I'll wake you up.

13
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,270
Should I?

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,020
I'll switch with you when I wake up.

15
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
Okay.

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Oh, wait.

17
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,600
Wait for a second.

18
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,800
Take this.

19
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,940
Are you okay? You're all wet.

20
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm okay.

21
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,100
Quick.

22
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,230
Lie down here. Use that as a blanket.

23
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,760
Come quickly before you're fully awake.

24
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,780
Dry yourself. You'll catch a cold.

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,280
I can brush it off. It's okay.

26
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Sit down.

27
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,790
Now.

28
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,450
Can I ask you something?

29
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,080
Why do you like me?

30
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,330
I'm just curious.

31
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,880
It wasn't love at first sight.

32
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,450
Excuse me!

33
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,020
Are you here for career counseling?

34
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,230
<i>At first...</i>

35
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,860
Then I'll see you at work next time.

36
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,530
<i>I wanted to see you once again.</i>

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,360
<i>I hoped to see you again.</i>

38
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,870
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

39
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,310
When I saw you again,

40
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,170
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

41
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,280
<i>You're kind and passionate,
just as I thought.</i>

42
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,490
I learned about your thoughts,
actions and expressions.

43
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
Learning more about you was great.

44
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,530
I don't know exactly when
I started to like you.

45
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,270
Nor do I know why.

46
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,730
It's just...

47
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,900
It's just because it's you.

48
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,510
I like you because you're you.

49
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,110
I think when you like someone,

50
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,530
that's what happens.

51
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,000
You see only what you want to see.

52
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,630
You think you've known enough
about that person.

53
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,100
But

54
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,970
you are mistaken.

55
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,110
I'm not that great of a person.

56
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm more foolish than you think.

57
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,180
And I'm pathetic.

58
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,900
Also,

59
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,270
I'm a bad person.

60
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,470
So...

61
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,150
So your heart is too big for me.

62
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,170
For a person like me to accept.

63
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,090
This is the only answer I can give you.

64
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,430
Warm yourself up.

65
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,310
I'll wait.

66
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,490
I can wait.
I won't make you uncomfortable.

67
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,190
I'll wait.

68
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,150
EPISODE 7

70
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,690
What are you doing?

71
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,710
Hey, baby.

72
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,680
You're late.

73
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,050
Some of them aren't right for you.

74
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,690
I thought I bought all your clothes,

75
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,410
but there are some tacky ones
mixed in here.

76
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,260
Did you buy them yourself?

77
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,150
Your taste isn't that good.

78
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,470
Leave them. I'll organize it.

79
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,130
You're busy. I'll do it.

80
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,669
We'll move into our new place soon.

81
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:53,840
I have to clean it out anyway.

82
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,850
I said I'll do it.

83
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,690
Okay then, you do it.

84
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,550
You look awfully drunk.

85
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,690
Is something wrong?

86
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,800
No.

87
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,250
You'd better go now.

88
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Jae-shin.

89
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,680
Your current place suits you the best.

90
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,880
As my brother's friend
and right next to me.

91
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,120
Just in case you forget.

92
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,190
Sometimes you get confused about
where you fit the best.

93
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,030
You look tired. Wash up and get some rest.

94
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,160
I'll get going now.

95
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,300
You must've worked awfully hard.
You did it all.

96
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,430
Looks like you did stay up all night.

97
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,040
Are you going back to the office?

98
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,700
No, they told us to take the day off.

99
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,080
Okay, drive safely back to Seoul.

100
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,590
-We'll leave the rest up to you.
-Sure, don't worry.

101
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,780
-Thank you.
-Sure.

102
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
Let's go.

103
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,790
Okay.

104
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,800
Let me know if you're sleepy. I can drive.

105
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,800
Okay.

106
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,150
Shall we listen to the radio?

107
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,580
<i>Morning Discovery.
This is your host, Lee Ji-hye.</i>

108
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,920
<i>We have a letter from
Mapo-gu Lovesick Guy.</i>

109
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,420
<i>There's something about his nickname.</i>

110
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,360
<i>Hello.</i>

111
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,850
<i>I'm a 27-year-old guy
who recently confessed my love</i>

112
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,370
<i>to a senior at work and got rejected.</i>

113
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,530
<i>My condolences to you, sir.</i>

114
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,060
<i>It rained yesterday.</i>

115
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,750
<i>You know that vibe.</i>

116
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,110
<i>So I confessed my love for her,
like a man.</i>

117
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,150
<i>But she said younger men
aren't her type.</i>

118
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,750
<i>A guy's heart isn't a joke.</i>

119
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,386
<i>Just because I'm younger,
my feelings don't matter, is it?</i>

120
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,060
<i>I was so hurt that...</i>

121
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,890
Let's just drive quietly.

122
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
We'll soon hit the rest stop.

123
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,880
Let's get something to eat.

124
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,180
Okay.

125
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,910
Hello, this is Chae Hyun-seung.

126
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,180
Oh, hello.

127
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,510
The Beauty Class banner company?

128
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,250
I'm not sure.

129
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,920
I think...

130
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,390
I'll ask Manager Kang and get back to you.

131
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,690
Okay, I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

132
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,730
I'll go on ahead.

133
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,330
Okay.

134
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,510
Happy birthday to you!

135
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,450
Happy birthday to you!

136
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,930
Happy birthday, dear Ha-eun!

137
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,360
Happy birthday to you!

138
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,640
You must have worked hard
to prepare everything.

139
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,150
I have to do this to
stop her from nagging me.

140
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,770
Where did you order the lunchboxes?

141
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,910
They were so pretty.

142
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,240
Could you pass me the info?

143
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,340
I want to order it for Ye-na's birthday.

144
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,350
I asked my husband's friend to do it.
He's a chef.

145
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,950
-From that restaurant?
-Yes.

146
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,550
Ha-eun asked, so I called him
and he said yes.

147
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,560
His recipes are really special indeed.

148
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,860
I tried to copy him at home,
but it didn't taste the same.

149
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,900
I guess that's why he's a famous chef.

150
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,930
I couldn't even think of copying him.

151
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,370
Could you ask him
if he can teach us his recipe?

152
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,210
His recipe?

153
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,540
I know it's not easy.

154
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,250
But I won't tell others.

155
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,210
I'll pay him handsomely.

156
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,950
I don't know if I can ask him that.

157
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,740
Come on, please.

158
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,550
Ask him if he's up for teaching a class.

159
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,120
Small restaurants these days
do that a lot.

160
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,460
Is that so?

161
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,560
Sounds great!

162
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,060
Alright, I'm in!

163
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,960
Me too.

164
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,830
Me too.

165
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,130
Okay, I'll ask him.

166
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,270
But don't get your hopes up.

167
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,210
I'm sorry to call you here.

168
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,440
I was suddenly short on ingredients.

169
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,000
It's okay.
I'm glad you could make time to see me.

170
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,020
And I can do my grocery shopping too.

171
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,820
I should get some of these.

172
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,350
What did you want to ask me?

173
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,830
Oh, about that...

174
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,700
Are you interested
in teaching a cooking class?

175
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,130
A cooking class?

176
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,500
Your recipe is special.

177
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,570
So people around me
are hyped to learn from you.

178
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,640
Just four people including me.

179
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
You too?

180
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,580
Yes. I love your cooking.

181
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,210
But I don't know if I can.

182
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,520
You're too busy, is it?

183
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,720
Even once a month would be great.

184
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,910
No, that's not what I mean.
It's just that I haven't done it before.

185
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,060
I'm not confident enough to do it.

186
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,200
I have an idea.

187
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,800
How about going to
another chef's cooking class?

188
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,530
If you see how it's done, it'll help.

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Well, I think that'll be good.

190
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,740
Right?

191
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,340
But I haven't been to one before.

192
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,930
Could you go with me?

193
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,810
Me?

194
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,180
I'd be shy going alone.

195
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
And I don't have anyone else to ask.

196
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,220
Sure. Why not?

197
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,840
PLUM BEIGE LIP COLOR RELAUNCH

198
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,240
RELAUNCH

199
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,640
We are holding an event
for the re-produced lipstick

200
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,600
this weekend.

201
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,120
After this event,

202
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,180
we'll decide whether
we should keep producing it.

203
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,680
Good job. It must've been hard.

204
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,490
Not at all.

205
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,190
Good job, Hyun-seung.

206
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,030
You did great stepping in eagerly
for the team.

207
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
Thank you.

208
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,750
Hyun-seung and Song-ah did great.

209
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,490
A round of applause for them.

210
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,510
Did anything happen to the two of you?

211
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,540
What do you mean?

212
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,180
When? What?

213
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,480
You two pulled an all-nighter together.

214
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,460
Did you not see a ghost?

215
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,060
I saw one before.

216
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,790
It was a woman in white.

217
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,560
And she had long hair like this.

218
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,730
It was me.

219
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,100
I grew my hair long
and wore a white T-shirt.

220
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,700
My ghost's hair was silky smooth.

221
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,600
So is mine.

222
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,700
You just gave me the creeps.

223
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,770
I'm getting goosebumps.

224
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,440
We were busy attaching stickers.

225
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,100
It was the director's order.

226
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,480
If we didn't do it on time...

227
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,380
That would've been scarier than a ghost.

228
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,980
You're right. That's scarier.

229
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,220
Let's go back to the meeting.

230
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,120
Oh, yes.

231
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,490
We're holding a new product
suggestion contest this year.

232
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,360
It'll be exactly the same as last year.

233
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,960
One mandatory participant
per team, as usual?

234
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,370
Yes. Any volunteers?

235
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,680
Then this time, it's Hyun-seung's turn.

236
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,980
The youngest one should do it
since he's quick-witted.

237
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,470
It's the same for other teams.

238
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,320
Song-ah did it every year.
You're finally free.

239
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,850
You'll be informed of the details,
so check the bulletin, Hyun-seung.

240
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,560
Team members, help him as much as you can.

241
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Yes, sir.

242
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,660
KLAR NEW PRODUCT SUGGESTION CONTEST

243
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,340
WE SUPPORT YOUR IDEA

244
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,770
It seems like a big deal, but it's not.

245
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,470
Don't feel too pressured.

246
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,770
I guess you're right.

247
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,560
But

248
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,840
Song-ah won first place every year.

249
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,910
I'm just saying. Good luck.

250
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,310
Song-ah is incredible.

251
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,380
Why make me do this?

252
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,050
What's wrong with being the youngest?

253
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,290
I've been pressured to win first place.

254
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,250
They told me the same thing too.

255
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,360
My manager wants the prize money
for the team dinner.

256
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,890
How much was it?

257
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,850
Three million won.

258
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,130
I heard it'll be taken into account
in our personnel evaluation.

259
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,800
Let's do it this way.

260
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,740
Give me all your ideas.

261
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,370
We'll do it by age this year.

262
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,810
I'll win first place, Hyun-seung's second

263
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,580
and Se-rim's third.

264
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,880
He has more ambition than he lets on.

265
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,110
-I'll get the coffee.
-No.

266
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,450
-I'll get it.
-Thanks.

267
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,920
What good idea is there?

268
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,890
-What good idea is there?
-Seriously.

269
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,690
Huh?

270
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
What is it?

271
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,670
Why? What?

272
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,970
Hyun-seung.

273
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,670
Isn't he the BM from your team?

274
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,520
{\an8}GRANDDAUGHTER OF KLAR COSMETIC
PLANS WEDDING WITH EMPLOYEE

275
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,250
Wait.

276
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,450
The BM Lee mentioned here.

277
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,120
-That's our BM Lee, right?
-I think so.

278
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,790
-He's the only BM who's still unmarried.
-Right.

279
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,920
Isn't he Director Lee's cousin?

280
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,390
But the woman in this article
is the director's sister.

281
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,120
How can the two get married?

282
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,200
They're not cousins then.

283
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,730
That's only a rumor, isn't it?

284
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,030
Yes, that's right.

285
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,900
BM Lee never said they were cousins.

286
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,710
Anyway, this is huge.

287
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,270
He'll become the chairman's
grandson-in-law.

288
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,440
Yes, you're right.

289
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,210
{\an8}PAGE NOT FOUND

290
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,380
Huh? The article has been deleted.

291
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,700
Huh?

292
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,980
What's the matter? It's deleted.

293
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,620
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

294
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,000
I asked them to delete the article.

295
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,530
We won't announce our stance or anything.

296
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,470
They're so bothersome.

297
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,310
How about announcing it now?

298
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,440
Now?

299
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,910
Most of the employees
must've seen the article.

300
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,110
It won't be good to confuse the employees.

301
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,550
I don't mind it being announced now.

302
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,820
Are you really okay with it?

303
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,390
You'll have to carefully watch
your actions after this.

304
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,020
We're going to get married anyway.

305
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,220
It's better if they talk to my face
than behind my back.

306
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,160
His promotion...

307
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,800
It's for sure.

308
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,300
Seriously.

309
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,830
Hello, sir.

310
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,940
You all must've seen the article.

311
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,510
It was deleted.

312
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,190
What's going on, sir?

313
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,740
The news about my marriage

314
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,350
is real.

315
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,380
I kept it a secret
because it's still early.

316
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,850
But now you know.

317
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,640
If you're free that day,
please come to the wedding.

318
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,950
-We'll make time to go.
-Of course.

319
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,660
Congratulations. A round of applause.

320
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,960
-Yes.
-Great.

321
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,860
Congratulations!

322
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,940
Let me treat you to a meal soon.

323
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,230
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

324
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,110
-Once again, congratulations.
-Congratulations.

325
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,530
<i>You must've been surprised today.</i>

326
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,570
Sorry for all the fuss, Grandpa.

327
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,840
I thought she was taking a picture
to see if the dress fits.

328
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,540
I didn't know she'd upload it
on her social media.

329
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,040
You really didn't know?

330
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,190
No. It never crossed my mind.

331
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,920
Are you still that insecure?

332
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,790
What did he do to make you cling to him?

333
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,190
There are a lot of better men out there.

334
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,390
I know.

335
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,730
I know Jae-shin isn't a great man.

336
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,170
But among all those people,

337
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,740
he was the only one who took care of me

338
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,400
when I was desperately in need.

339
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,910
So I can never let him go, Grandpa.

340
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,840
Even if you can't let go,

341
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,910
you can't keep hold of someone's heart.

342
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,570
Even if you break their legs

343
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,950
and make them sit next to you,

344
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,250
you can't win their heart.

345
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,120
I'm good if I can just
keep him next to me.

346
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,460
I remember what you taught us.

347
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,600
We must only desire what we can have.

348
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,900
We must only challenge what we can handle.

349
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,410
I won't struggle to hold on to his heart.

350
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,280
You don't have to worry.

351
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,050
It seems like Jae-shin knows for sure now.

352
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,520
That I have to be next to him.

353
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm going home now.

354
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,190
Are you working late, Song-ah?

355
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,820
Yes.

356
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,450
Someone has to go
to the color makeup section soon.

357
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,060
Not me, you know that, right?

358
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,830
I know.
I can't send you because I'm scared.

359
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,320
Color makeup has enough problems already.

360
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,840
You'll make it explode.

361
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,940
I'll make it boom!

362
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,880
I know.

363
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,710
Don't worry.

364
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
Are you leaving, Hyun-seung?

365
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,380
Want to go for a drink?

366
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,820
I'm going to do a brainstorming session

367
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,220
with my recruit buddies.

368
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,720
You're starting on that already?

369
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,460
Yes, I'm starting early.

370
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,770
Wow, he never half-asses it.

371
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,920
-He's like me.
-As if.

372
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,070
Hyun-seung, do you know MLB?

373
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,580
The LA Dodgers?

374
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,930
Yes, I do.

375
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,900
They won Rookie of the Year
for five years in a row.

376
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,010
In 1992, Eric Karros.

377
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,240
-In 1993, Mike Piazza.
-Piazza.

378
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,310
In 1994...

379
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,350
Raul Mondesi.

380
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,010
That's right.

381
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,720
-In 1995...
-Nomo Hideo.

382
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,020
-How did you know?
-Get to the point.

383
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,750
Well, I mean...

384
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,650
We can win first place 3 years in a row.

385
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,560
Hyun-seung, fight on!

386
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,690
-Thanks.
-You can do it!

387
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,330
If you don't know something, ask Song-ah.

388
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,530
Of course, she'll teach you well anyway.

389
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,230
She won first place no matter what.

390
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,030
Good luck.

391
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,550
Thanks.

392
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,330
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.

393
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,400
Manager Ahn, do you want to grab dinner?

394
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Hey...

395
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,500
Let's go eat.

396
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Hey, guys.

397
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,740
Hello.

398
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,370
Are you working late too?

399
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:02,970
Yes.

400
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
Do you want to get dinner with us?

401
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,170
It's okay, it won't take long.

402
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,110
Go eat.

403
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,380
Then treat us to dinner next time, please.

404
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,680
Hyun-seung has been
complimenting you non-stop.

405
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,350
I'm sick and tired of it.

406
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,650
There's no time. Let's go.

407
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,350
No time?

408
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,780
We have a tight schedule.

409
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,260
-Really?
-Let's go eat quickly.

410
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,790
-Do we have to go now?
-Come on.

411
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,060
-I'll look forward to that dinner!
-Forget it. Come on.

412
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,160
Bye.

413
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,130
Let's go! We don't have much time.

414
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,300
I'll get going too.

415
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,270
Enjoy your dinner.

416
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,010
Thanks. Goodbye.

417
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,340
Hurry up!

418
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,940
I'm coming!

419
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,320
Absorbs into my skin.

420
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,160
Ah, it's so refreshing.

421
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,190
Goodness. What are you doing, Director?

422
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,930
Director Lee is becoming beautiful!

423
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,560
Hey! I just put it on!

424
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,400
You won't get prettier with this.

425
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,000
How displeasing to my eyes.

426
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,490
If you act this way after you get married,

427
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,670
you'd be in trouble.

428
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,810
Mind your own business.

429
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,210
Right.

430
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,710
Why did you change the dress shop?

431
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,280
Why?

432
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,050
You even changed the date
to match their schedule.

433
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,020
Why'd you change shops?

434
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,350
I heard the news today.

435
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,020
It didn't satisfy my expectation.

436
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,320
Empty vessels make the most sound.

437
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,420
Maybe it's because you were fussy?

438
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,380
You should've gone to a better place then.

439
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,960
They leaked your photo.

440
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,770
We'll make an official statement soon.

441
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,340
Jae-shin agreed to it.

442
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,600
He did?

443
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,670
Yes. He didn't want you to be criticized.

444
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,880
Thanks anyway.

445
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,680
Lunch tomorrow? It's on me.

446
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
No. I'm busy all weekend.

447
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,150
Doing what? You have nothing to do.

448
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,860
This time, I do.

449
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,490
And it's very important to me.

450
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,130
How about a melting mask
that you can sleep on it?

451
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,530
I think that already exists.

452
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,270
Really?

453
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,940
Everything I say already exists.

454
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,620
Then what isn't there?

455
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,540
How about this?

456
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,950
Highly concentrated ampoule
on top and essence below it.

457
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,740
When you turn the container
for the first time,

458
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,140
the ampoule drops
and mixes with the essence.

459
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,660
Ampoule essence.

460
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,420
You're a genius.

461
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,790
Can you give that idea to me?

462
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,430
It exists.

463
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,460
Seriously, I quit! I quit!

464
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,000
Do we have to consider the prime cost?

465
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,170
I think so, feasibility is
one of the evaluation criteria.

466
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,210
I'm thinking about adopting
a disposable ampoule

467
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,240
to the container Hyun-seung suggested.

468
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,280
Sounds good.

469
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,610
I don't know if we can make
that kind of container.

470
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,080
It's disposable
so it has to be super small,

471
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,790
but it'll be more expensive.

472
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,650
Right.

473
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,890
How much will a container cost?

474
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,730
What?

475
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,090
She's still here.

476
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,890
Who?

477
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,900
Your senior.

478
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,810
Senior Yoon.

479
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,480
Yes?

480
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,130
We were talking and we wanted
to ask you something.

481
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,720
What is it?

482
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,290
We want to make
a disposable container that mixes

483
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,620
the top layer and bottom layer
when twisted.

484
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,630
Will it be possible to make one
in such a small size?

485
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,130
It's possible.

486
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,030
It doesn't have to be turned.

487
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,070
You can find another way too.

488
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,340
Then what about the prime price?

489
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,790
It's fine as long as
it's not ridiculously high.

490
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,240
Don't worry about it.

491
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,480
It's hard enough to think of a new idea.

492
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,580
It'll be harder if you
need to consider that.

493
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,280
Okay. Thank you.

494
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,520
Are you heading home now?

495
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,560
Yes.

496
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,890
Are you okay?

497
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,890
About what?

498
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,800
Today's article.

499
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,980
I shouldn't ask these things anymore.

500
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,770
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,310
No, it's okay.

502
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,840
It's not like I didn't know.

503
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,150
That's a relief.

504
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,680
Also...

505
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,450
If you, by any chance,
have any other questions, you can ask.

506
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,220
Okay.

507
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,230
Get home safely.

508
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,490
Okay.

509
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,180
Did something happen between you and her?

510
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,580
What?

511
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,390
You two seemed awkward.

512
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,550
Different from usual.

513
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,870
No, nothing happened.

514
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,590
Why would we seem awkward?

515
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,270
Do you want to do
market research with me tomorrow?

516
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,330
Let's do it separately.

517
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,400
The clerks will notice
if we show up together.

518
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,400
Okay, then.

519
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,950
Welcome! We're KLAR!

520
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,800
Welcome.

521
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,540
I'll contact you
when the design is completed.

522
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,080
Okay. I look forward to it.

523
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,780
Leave it to us.

524
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,750
-Okay.
-Thanks.

525
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:20,980
Take care.

526
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,950
Bye.

527
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,280
You're exhausted, right?

528
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,920
You've got no time to rest this weekend.

529
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
I am.

530
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,090
You'll soon be able to buy the lipstick
you were looking for.

531
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,830
When you get the word,
come anytime you want.

532
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,470
I'll doll up and wait for you.

533
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,270
-Manager.
-Yes, ma'am.

534
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,370
Department stores close at 8:30 p.m.
on the weekends, right?

535
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,810
Yes.

536
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
Why?

537
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,310
Nothing.

538
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,220
I'll be in my office.

539
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,510
Let me know when the next client comes.

540
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,810
Sure.

541
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,580
I shouldn't ask these things anymore.

542
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,430
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,640
Why make that face?

544
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,410
Huh? What?

545
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,210
Huh?

546
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,890
Did something happen?

547
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,350
No.

548
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,760
You have plans today?

549
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,360
Not really.

550
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,660
Let's go out.

551
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Where to?

552
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,200
I'm at Garosu-gil right now.

553
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,170
<i>Do you want to meet up
at our usual place later?</i>

554
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,560
Again?

555
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,340
Please don't interfere with my weekend.

556
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,630
<i>You jerk.</i>

557
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,980
<i>Never mind. Bye.</i>

558
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,180
What the...

559
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,950
What do you think?

560
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,280
It's pretty.

561
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,560
Good. I'm going with this.

562
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,690
Aren't you getting anything?

563
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,730
I don't need anything.

564
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,590
You don't buy clothes
because you need them.

565
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,330
You look around and buy some pretty stuff.

566
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,469
It's on me. Choose something.

567
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,739
You don't have money to buy me clothes.

568
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,300
Come here.

569
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,780
Wow, there are lots of
pretty clothes here.

570
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,810
This is pretty.

571
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,219
How about this?
Just buy this. It's pretty.

572
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,280
I can't wear this to work.

573
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,550
Wear it well.

574
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,760
Okay.

575
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,909
Tell me when you need something.

576
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,920
I'll buy it for you.

577
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,630
You never owe someone, do you?

578
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,050
Anyway, I'm so hungry.

579
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,400
-Want to eat something?
-Yes.

580
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,570
What should we have?

581
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,929
Huh?

582
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,540
What?

583
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,840
ABM Chae Hyun-seung!

584
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,590
Hey, Ga-young!

585
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,550
Hello!

586
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,350
Oh, hi.

587
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,480
What brings you here?

588
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,920
We were shopping.

589
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,650
I came to do market research.

590
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,920
But it's the weekend.

591
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Song-ah trained you to be a workaholic.

592
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,830
You two are the same.

593
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,730
Hi.

594
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,020
You must be busy.

595
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,100
You can go if you want.

596
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,240
Okay.

597
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,580
Have you had lunch?

598
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,640
Hey!

599
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,310
We're on our way to lunch.

600
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,950
If you haven't had it yet, join us.

601
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,880
You have to eat alone if you go home.

602
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,350
Let's go, come on!

603
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,870
Let's go!

604
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,290
Hey, Ga-young.

605
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,350
Cheers!

606
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,900
It's so good.

607
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,700
Eat up, ABM Chae. I'm buying.

608
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,460
No, it's on me.

609
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,440
No, I dragged you here, so I'm buying.

610
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,070
Okay.

611
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,240
What a coincidence

612
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,910
to run into each other here!

613
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,680
Right?

614
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,580
I was wondering how you were doing.

615
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,120
Why didn't you come by the store nowadays?

616
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,820
Actually, my work assignment has changed.

617
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,820
Why so?

618
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,530
I work on skincare and
door-to-door channel now.

619
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,520
Then what about Song-ah?

620
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,300
You don't work with her anymore?

621
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,870
No.

622
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,010
So that's why you were down and low.

623
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,810
What are you talking about?

624
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,280
Why have you become so thin?

625
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,910
Eat up, okay? Here.

626
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,010
Well, I...

627
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,650
She doesn't like skinny guys.

628
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,760
Eat up.

629
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,650
Hey!

630
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,290
Alright. I'll give you some, too. Wait.

631
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,090
Here comes the meat. Open your mouth.

632
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,130
Ow, it's hot.

633
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,210
I'll cool it down for you.

634
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,430
Here.

635
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,300
It's okay, right?

636
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,470
Eat.

637
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,160
What's taking her so long in the bathroom?

638
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,770
Does the market research help?

639
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,470
Yes, more or less.

640
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,000
This won't do.

641
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,850
I'll go check on her.

642
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,930
KIM GA-YOUNG

643
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,910
<i>I suddenly got a severe stomachache.</i>

644
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,650
<i>So I'm going home.</i>

645
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,870
<i>Don't desert the ABM. Walk him home.</i>

646
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,970
<i>Come home as late as you want.</i>

647
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,470
Kim Ga-young!

648
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,240
Why? What did she say?

649
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,510
Oh...

650
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,080
She went home because of a stomachache.

651
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,540
Is it bad?

652
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,920
It's nothing to worry about.

653
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,730
Should we say goodbye here?

654
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,440
Sure.

655
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,540
Tell Ga-young it was good seeing her.

656
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,750
Manager Kang?

657
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,980
It's really Manager Kang.

658
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,420
You're right.

659
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,640
Run!

660
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,740
What?

661
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,240
Run! Now!

662
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,090
Your shoe.

663
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Are you okay?

664
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,670
Let's go.

665
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
It'll be okay now, right?

666
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,500
Yes.

667
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,950
I'm so exhausted.

668
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,050
-Senior Yoon.
-Yes?

669
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,660
Why were we running?

670
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,530
I don't know.

671
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,060
Why did we run?

672
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,440
Did I tell you to run?

673
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,410
You told me to run just now.

674
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,930
How could you forget?

675
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,280
Hey, you ran with me.

676
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm so exhausted.

677
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,570
Ow, it hurts.

678
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,560
Hello!

679
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,900
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

680
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,830
You're here.

681
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,690
Get me a glass of water.

682
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,160
Is something wrong?

683
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,530
You said you had an errand.

684
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,770
It's nothing.

685
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,460
Weren't you busy today?

686
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,770
No, we didn't have that many customers.

687
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,220
I'll go inside and rest for a while.

688
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,460
What's up with her?

689
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,300
How's your foot?

690
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,730
It's okay.

691
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,940
You really don't exercise, do you?

692
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,510
You seemed out of breath.

693
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,510
I know. I need to exercise, right?

694
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,180
If I assess my metabolic age,

695
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,350
it'd say I'm in my 50s.

696
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,680
You went too far.

697
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,380
Okay, then maybe in my 40s?

698
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,390
70s.

699
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,150
In your 70s.

700
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,060
What?

701
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,690
What did you buy?

702
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,700
Oh, this?

703
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,450
It's not my taste,

704
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,700
but Ga-young bought it for me.

705
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,170
It must be a dress or a skirt.

706
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,540
How do you know so well?

707
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,760
What I said that time...

708
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,800
I hope you're not too hurt by it.

709
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,270
I know I've been pushing you away.

710
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,010
And it's ridiculous to say this now.

711
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,790
But I've been wanting to say this.

712
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,750
I hope you don't make that face.

713
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,390
You're not the problem.

714
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,100
For now,

715
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,830
I don't think I can handle anyone.

716
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,470
I don't want to be scared or swayed

717
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,010
by the wounds that jerk gave me.

718
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,110
But I can't help it right now.

719
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,820
Anyway, thanks.

720
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,990
I feel less pathetic.

721
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,560
Thanks to you.

722
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,660
I won't forget that.

723
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,890
Are you

724
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,750
never going to see me again?

725
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,240
You talk as if you'll never see me again.

726
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,040
Why would I not see you?

727
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,710
That's enough for me.

728
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,850
Actually, I knew it from the start.

729
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,010
I wanted you to be mine

730
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,620
when I interfered in your relationship.

731
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,720
I knew I was being selfish.

732
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,500
So I didn't expect a lot from the start.

733
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,030
But I'm a greedy guy.

734
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,310
Seeing you smiling at me made me think.

735
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,880
I thought things might really
go well with you.

736
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,150
I thought I might really
become your boyfriend.

737
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,320
So it was my fault.

738
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,040
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,160
I made you say difficult words.

740
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,210
Anyway...

741
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,860
If I can keep seeing you like this,

742
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,910
I'd be content.

743
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,310
I'll maintain the distance
if that's what you wish.

744
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,610
Like now. Like this.

745
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,080
Is that okay?

746
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,850
Why aren't you stretching?

747
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,510
I said I don't want to.

748
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,150
Why do you want to jog?
You've never done it before.

749
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,090
That's why I need to start jogging now.

750
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,590
If my metabolic age is 70, so is yours.

751
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,620
We won't be able to run in a war.

752
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,730
We'll just die.

753
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,820
What era are you living in?

754
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,170
If there is a war,

755
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,600
bombs will come flying and boom!

756
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,870
We all just die.

757
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,600
I'm leaving.

758
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,410
-Where are you going?
-Hey!

759
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,240
Run! Go!

760
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,420
This is nice.

761
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,780
Indeed.

762
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,620
Shall we hang it in our new home?

763
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,850
If you like it.

764
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,800
What?

765
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
I'm happy.

766
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,530
It's been so long since we went on a date.

767
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,070
I'll take more care of you from now on.

768
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,960
I won't make you upset like last time.

769
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,470
You'll be even busier
once you go to Europe,

770
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,110
so let's go on lots of dates.

771
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,480
Okay.

772
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,180
-Just a second.
-Okay.

773
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,480
Who is it?

774
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,760
I don't know this number.

775
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,490
You ignore it?

776
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,560
What if it's work?

777
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,030
They'll call back.

778
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,230
Don't worry about it.

779
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,010
Why isn't he picking up?

780
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,740
I sent him the account number long ago.

781
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,200
-Hey, Lee!
-Yes, sir!

782
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,880
Over here.

783
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,720
Yes, sir. I'm coming.

784
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,210
Thank you.

785
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,130
Throw it in.

786
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,660
Let's do this.

787
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,800
Go around.

788
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,300
Throw it in.

789
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,400
I'll keep going then.

790
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,670
No one is throwing it in.

791
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,040
Today's the last day of the promotion.

792
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,040
Why isn't she coming?

793
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,100
Director Lee Jae-woon.

794
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,950
Executive Director!

795
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,520
What brings you here on a weekend?

796
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,880
I just came to see
if everything is going well.

797
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,230
Let's have a cup of tea.
It's been so long.

798
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,230
Right now?

799
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,530
Are you busy?

800
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,990
No. Let's go then.

801
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,740
Okay. This way.

802
00:49:31,493 --> 00:49:32,593
RELAUNCH

803
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,490
Welcome! We're KLAR!

804
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,050
Are you looking for something?

805
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,510
Sorry.

806
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,870
Do you have the relaunched lipstick?

807
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,030
That one?

808
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,040
We sold the last one just a moment ago.

809
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,180
I guess I'm too late.

810
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,550
I'm sorry.

811
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,520
No, it's okay. Have a nice day.

812
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,930
Take a look.

813
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,440
Open it.

814
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,560
I reproduced it for someone.

815
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,900
That someone must have it.

816
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,830
Thank you for this.

817
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,570
I didn't say it's free.

818
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,340
My name is Lee Jae-woon.

819
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,810
What's your name?

820
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,080
It's Chae Ji-seung.

821
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,360
Chae Ji-seung.

822
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,880
Am I done with the payment?

823
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,950
One more thing.

824
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,950
Am I one of the reasons you came today?

825
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,530
If I don't answer that,

826
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,260
do I need to return the lipstick?

827
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,260
No.

828
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,600
You already paid for that
when you showed up today.

829
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,720
I wanted to get more,
but I guess it won't work.

830
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:46,980
I don't want my interest
to be a burden to you.

831
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,280
Do you have a business card?

832
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,350
Let's set up a date formally next time.

833
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,850
Lee Jae-woon.

834
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,070
Yikes!

835
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,210
What is it, ma'am?

836
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,540
What kind of eyeshadow are you wearing?

837
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,380
What?

838
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,290
Eyeshadow?

839
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,190
I'm testing a new one.

840
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,830
Is that so? Looks good on you.

841
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,830
Thank you.

842
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,800
What's up with you?

843
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,370
You never give compliments.

844
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,130
I'm just stating a fact.

845
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,700
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

846
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,290
Stop laughing.

847
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:52,830
Wait.

848
00:52:58,650 --> 00:52:59,860
What is it?

849
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,090
Tell me if you need anything.

850
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,190
Today's snack?

851
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,120
Instant noodles.

852
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,900
I'm going insane.

853
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,170
Stop laughing! Seriously!

854
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,610
Why can't I laugh?

855
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,540
You want noodles too?

856
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,610
Go help yourself.

857
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,560
Noodles, my butt.

858
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,600
<i>Does your father still visit?</i>

859
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:51,270
Blood ties and attachment
make you incompetent.

860
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,540
<i>Your position is out of your league.</i>

861
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,960
<i>So get your act straight.</i>

862
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:06,619
MYUNGJIN INN

863
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
That darn jerk.

864
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,750
Why'd he say he'd give me money?

865
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,020
Darn it.

866
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,520
I should've gotten a better settlement.

867
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,720
Sheesh.

868
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,680
Come in.

869
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,320
You should've told me you're coming.

870
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,100
What are you doing? Sit down.

871
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,070
What did you do with the money
you took from me?

872
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,540
Like you gave me a lot.

873
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,110
Some might think you gave me millions.

874
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,170
Never mind that.

875
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,390
Why didn't you answer my calls?

876
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,750
Why haven't you sent the money?

877
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,150
What do you do for a living?

878
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,520
You never care about me.

879
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,030
Why did you ask?

880
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,750
Are you playing a good son now?

881
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,800
How much do you want?

882
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,980
Let's disown each other.

883
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,270
How much will it take to do that?

884
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,440
What?

885
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,420
So you want to sever blood ties
by paying me?

886
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,520
Make a choice.

887
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,390
Take the money and cut ties with me.

888
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,620
Or get no money and watch me die.

889
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,300
How dare you threaten me!

890
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,010
How much can you give me?

891
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,350
Name a price.

892
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,830
300 million won.

893
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,980
Give me 300 million won then.

894
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,206
300 MILLION WON HAS BEEN
DEPOSITED TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

895
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,040
From this moment onward,
I have no father.

896
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,550
Remember, you gave this to me!

897
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,490
I'll never give it back to you!

898
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:02,990
Good work today.

899
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,690
Thank you, Senior Yoon.

900
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,160
Your advice helped us a lot
with the contest.

901
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:07,970
You flatter me.

902
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,430
You all are so good, I did nothing.

903
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:14,170
How can you say that?
You gave us lots of tips.

904
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:17,640
If one of us wins the prize,
we'll treat you big time.

905
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,880
We should treat her even if we don't win.

906
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,250
Then we'll treat you
even if we don't win.

907
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,340
You don't have to.

908
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,720
Just make it to the PT round.

909
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,250
Okay.

910
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,840
You're heading home, right?

911
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,980
How will you go?

912
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,050
I'll take the bus over there.

913
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,150
I brought my car.

914
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,590
Do you want me to drive you home?

915
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,290
It's okay. I'll take the bus.

916
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,330
I'll be going now. Get home safely.

917
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:39,990
Okay.

918
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,900
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.

919
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,470
Get home safely, Senior Yoon!

920
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,970
Let's go. Drop us off on your way home.

921
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:48,810
Okay.

922
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,010
Let's go.

923
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,350
{\an8}CHAE HYUN-SEUNG

924
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,780
<i>Did you get home safely?</i>

925
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:09,900
<i>This is an innocent question
from a junior to a senior.</i>

926
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,950
<i>I just arrived.</i>

927
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,160
<i>See you tomorrow, Junior Chae.</i>

928
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,610
<i>Okay, Senior Yoon.</i>

929
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,130
Let's go.

930
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:42,860
Yes, sir.

931
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,570
Here.

932
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,410
Give it to the models
or celebrity friends of yours.

933
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,650
It's a new essence.

934
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,930
If it's good enough,

935
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,710
ask them to upload it
on their social media.

936
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,250
Can they say it's not good
if they don't like it?

937
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,180
Geez.

938
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,880
Whatever.

939
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:08,980
Where are you going?

940
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,550
To the studio.

941
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,250
I have to wrap up yesterday's shoot.

942
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,660
Are you still busy nowadays?

943
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,620
Not really.

944
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,930
I'm turning down new projects.

945
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,320
I'm going to focus on
my married life after the wedding.

946
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,160
I won't be able to do that if not now.

947
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,430
Are you that happy
to get married to Jae-shin?

948
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,160
Yes.

949
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,800
What a quick and assured answer.

950
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,480
I'll leave now. I've stayed for too long.

951
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,280
Are you not going to see Jae-shin?

952
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,340
No. I don't want to bother him.

953
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,950
I'll see myself out.

954
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,390
Which floor?

955
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:20,920
-Tenth floor.
-Tenth floor.

956
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:30,770
Hold the elevator!

957
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,670
Thank you.

958
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,850
Oh, right.

959
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,820
You know, your senior...

960
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,920
-My senior?
-Yes.

961
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,860
She's a really nice person,
just like you said.

962
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,630
She doesn't have a boyfriend, right?

963
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,230
Why do you ask?

964
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,560
Is she interested in a blind date?

965
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,460
I have a friend who'd be perfect for her.

966
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,700
Is Senior Yoon Song-ah 28 years old?

967
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,300
Forget it. She's not interested.

968
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:10,370
Why?

969
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,070
You said she doesn't have a boyfriend.

970
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,410
My friend is really great.

971
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:16,310
He has looks, personality,
qualifications and everything.

972
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,310
This is your floor.

973
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,510
I should go.

974
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,320
Tell her about it, okay?

975
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,190
I'll send a photo later. Bye.

976
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,080
Why are you two together?

977
01:02:47,482 --> 01:02:48,632
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

978
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,964
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

979
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:34,205
<i>Chae Hyun-seung!</i>

980
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,530
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

981
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,855
<i>You are the one that I really need.</i>

982
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,210
<i>Aren't they flirting?</i>

983
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,290
<i>It's just a crush.</i>

984
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,270
<i>They are dating?</i>

985
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,590
<i>Manager Ahn!</i>

986
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,926
<i>Go for it!</i>

987
01:03:52,408 --> 01:03:53,945
<i>I still like you a lot.</i>
