1
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:11,403
ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,930
Sir,

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,400
I need to go to the basement.

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,790
Okay.

5
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,160
An announcement about the Europe Project
will be released soon.

6
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,200
Don't worry, your name isn't on the list.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,570
I'm running KLAR as well as
the Europe Project,

8
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,830
so we'll still run into each other.

9
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,839
But don't mind me.

10
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,670
Be patient for a couple of months.

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,809
You don't have to mind me either.

12
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,309
I'm okay.

13
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,450
This will be the last time
we talk privately.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,590
Don't mention the past again.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Let bygones be bygones.

16
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,230
Don't worry.

17
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,550
That's what I want too.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
Okay.

19
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,340
Why are you two together?

20
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,660
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

21
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,910
You can go now.

22
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,310
You're busy. Get back to work.

23
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,050
Okay.

24
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,430
By the way,

25
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,350
what you said earlier...

26
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,280
Oh, that?

27
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,890
Actually, I saw her at the store before.

28
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,790
At the store?

29
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,650
Yes.

30
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,630
I thought she was a store employee.

31
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,730
When I saw you together,
I was surprised, so...

32
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,240
Is she an HQ employee?

33
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,730
Is she your subordinate?

34
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,100
Yes, she's on my team.

35
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,120
Then who's the man?

36
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,510
Are they dating?

37
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,410
Yes.

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,020
I see.

39
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,090
They look good together.

40
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,590
I'll get going now.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,030
Drive safely.

42
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,830
Okay.

43
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,690
EPISODE 8

44
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,690
I'm so tired.

45
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,060
You must be tired, Manager Ahn.

46
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,830
I've prepared a piping hot cup of coffee.

47
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
Thank you.

48
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,970
-It's sweet and delicious.
-Right?

49
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,770
Call me whenever you're tired.

50
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,890
-Okay.
-Good.

51
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,980
This is so good.

52
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,590
So good.

53
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,020
Oh, my gosh. How can I carry this?

54
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,190
It looks so heavy.

55
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,140
I'll carry it!

56
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,160
I'll carry it, Manager Ahn.

57
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,490
-Oh.
-It's heavy.

58
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,630
You don't have to do it.
It goes in the mailroom.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,300
Oh, the mailroom.

60
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,170
Hurry!

61
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,370
Okay.

62
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,870
Song-ah?

63
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,850
You're leaving?

64
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,820
Yes.

65
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,890
Take care.

66
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,860
Hyun-seung!

67
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,360
Did something happen
between you and Manager Ahn?

68
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,660
Manager Ahn?

69
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,030
Did you make a mistake?

70
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,470
Why are you walking on eggshells
around her?

71
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,340
Nothing happened.

72
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,270
Really?

73
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,710
How far are you going to go?

74
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,820
Sorry. What I did back there...

75
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,130
It's okay.

76
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,460
You don't have to make excuses.

77
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,740
You did it to help me.

78
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Senior Yoon...

79
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,840
You should go inside.

80
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,910
What about you?

81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,910
I have an urgent business.

82
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,220
You go up first.

83
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,180
Okay then.

84
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,790
-See you later.
-Okay.

85
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,210
I owe her something.

86
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,780
-You owe her?
-Yes, but...

87
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,410
The elevator door is closing.

88
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,950
Okay then.

89
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,670
-Don't work too late.
-I won't.

90
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,680
See you tomorrow.

91
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,470
Yikes!

92
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,240
Manager Ahn!

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,600
How could I not know about that?

94
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,810
It's right before my eyes
and yet I couldn't tell.

95
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,529
My goodness! Your crush is Song...

96
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:59,610
No!

97
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,500
Manager Ahn!

98
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,620
Anyway, you're lucky I caught you.

99
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,880
If it was someone else,

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,890
the entire company
would've been in an uproar.

101
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,890
If you need anything,
please tell me at any time.

102
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,160
You like her so much.

103
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,190
I feel sorry for you.

104
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,030
I'm always rooting for you, Hyun-seung.

105
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,570
First floor!

106
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,870
Oh!

107
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,870
First floor!

108
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,370
First floor.

109
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,710
Go for it!

110
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,210
Goodbye.

111
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,090
{\an8}LEE JAE-WOON

112
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,100
<i>So when are we going to meet?</i>

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
I didn't know I'd see you this soon.

114
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,330
I was just asking,

115
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,150
and you said you haven't had dinner.

116
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
But

117
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,390
you've hardly eaten anything.

118
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,060
Oh, right, I...

119
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,430
You don't have to force yourself.

120
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,930
You'll upset your stomach.

121
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,700
Are you upset?

122
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,000
Because I lied about not having dinner?

123
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,870
I prefer a man who doesn't lie.

124
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,040
Okay, I'll never lie to you again.

125
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,680
Even if it's trivial.

126
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,350
Do you always try to
please other people like this?

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,850
No, I'm only doing it for you.

128
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,090
By the way,

129
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,960
what do you do?

130
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,360
I make clothes.

131
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,330
What kind of clothes?
There are so many kinds of them.

132
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,610
Wedding dresses.

133
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,500
I took over my mother's shop.

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,660
I see.

135
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,970
Too bad. If I had known earlier,

136
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,340
I'd ask you to make
my sister's wedding dress.

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
No, I'd better not.

138
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,350
Her temper is so...

139
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,080
I think I made a mistake.

140
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,620
What?

141
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,010
A bad-tempered sister-in-law

142
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,780
is a turn-off, right?

143
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,360
This is only the first time
we're eating together.

144
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,570
You're right.

145
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,450
Go on and eat.

146
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,200
I'll drink cold water and get a grip.

147
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,040
Excuse me! Can I get some cold water?

148
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,310
Right.

149
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,650
We don't know about each other's age yet.

150
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,180
I'm 37 years old.

151
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,860
Two years apart then.

152
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,660
You're 39 years old?

153
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,790
Who?

154
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,000
Then...

155
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,570
35 years old?

156
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,270
Yes.

157
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,140
Huh?

158
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,240
Why are you flustered?

159
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,000
There's no reason for it.

160
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,740
Oh, I like this place.

161
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,020
But you don't like me?

162
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,500
Go away.

163
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Hello? Where's the owner?

164
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,410
Get behind me.

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,010
Hi, sweetie. Why are you here alone?

166
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,080
Seung-ah!

167
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,550
I'm sorry, I lost my grip.

168
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,290
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,190
It's okay.

170
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,690
Goodbye!

171
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,910
Are you alright?

172
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,740
Oh, I...

173
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm still scared.

174
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,280
There are so many dogs here.

175
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,640
Let's go.

176
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,960
This dish looks good.

177
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,230
So you can do it this way.

178
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,110
Are you watching something fun?

179
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,170
Huh?

180
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,310
Is it more fun than what I'm watching?

181
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,180
I want to watch too.

182
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,420
Are you really watching this?

183
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,560
Yes, I'm watching this.

184
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,030
It can't be.

185
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,660
It looked like it was so much fun.

186
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,060
Time for bed, Ha-eun!

187
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,600
Dad!

188
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,970
What are you working on so hard?

189
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,100
I told you.

190
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,360
Chef Ryu and I are
working on a cooking class.

191
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,210
I'm looking for references.

192
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,130
Take it easy. You must be tired.

193
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,640
Don't worry, I'll take care of myself.

194
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,540
Tuck Ha-eun in for me.

195
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,120
Right, Ha-eun.

196
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,690
Good night, Mom!

197
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,720
Good night, sweetie!

198
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,790
Let's go.

199
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,570
Your uterine myoma has grown.

200
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,640
It's grown?

201
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,180
It used to be the same.

202
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,730
You said you've been
feeling pain recently?

203
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,740
And there's some bleeding?

204
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,810
I came because my lower belly hurt more.

205
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,010
It looks like

206
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,930
it's suddenly grown bigger recently.

207
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,850
It's a low chance,

208
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,430
but we should perform surgery
and take a biopsy of it.

209
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,870
Then is it...

210
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,900
Is it cancer?

211
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,660
<i>I can't say for sure.</i>

212
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
<i>Let's perform surgery first.</i>

213
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,120
DAUGHTER

214
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,910
Wait!

215
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,100
No...

216
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,190
RECRUITING NEW MARKETERS
FOR KLAR COSMETICS

217
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,400
Senior Yoon! I'll do it.

218
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,870
Will you?

219
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,700
Yes.

220
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,430
Thanks.

221
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,850
We're set to go, right?

222
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes, I think so.

223
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,020
Wow, this place brings back memories.

224
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,890
It seems like only yesterday
I saw you here.

225
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,980
Indeed.

226
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,330
It feels strange seeing you here.

227
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,030
I didn't know I'd see you again.

228
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,700
Thanks for what you did back then.

229
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,300
You brought me something to eat.

230
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,340
I was so hungry at that time,
I was about to go crazy.

231
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,610
I would've snapped off a desk leg
and gnawed it down.

232
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,080
A desk leg?

233
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Oh, a desk leg.

234
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,220
I missed out on a good show.

235
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,090
Gnawing on a desk leg
sounds like a circus act.

236
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,360
You'll make this noise when you eat it.

237
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,080
A circus act?

238
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,600
Yes.

239
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,160
It's not too late.

240
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,830
Want me to snap off a desk leg
and beat you with it?

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Come in, please.

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,410
Stop joking...

243
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,560
Hello.

244
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,180
You should've believed me.

245
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,010
Shut up.

246
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,640
-Sit here.
-Hi, please come in.

247
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,920
Come over here, please.

248
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh, you brought your papers?

249
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,320
Read this carefully,

250
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,560
and ask me what you'd like to know.

251
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,729
This is my business card.

252
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,400
Thank you.

253
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,219
Read this carefully,

254
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,000
and take your time to ask me questions.

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,570
Okay.

256
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,600
Something good is going on?

257
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,449
Huh? Nothing.

258
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,949
Right!

259
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,490
You know about it, right?

260
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,260
About what?

261
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,160
Song-ah and Hyun-seung!

262
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,060
They are busted?

263
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,130
So busted.

264
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,700
If you know it, you should've told me.

265
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I almost set Hyun-seung
up on a blind date.

266
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,200
How could I? They are dating secretly.

267
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,110
Dating? What do you mean?

268
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,410
You said you know.

269
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,310
I do.

270
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,010
About Hyun-seung's crush.

271
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,620
What?

272
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,210
It's a crush?

273
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,490
They're dating?

274
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,520
Aren't they flirting?

275
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,930
Crush.

276
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,260
Aren't they dating?

277
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,430
Flirting?

278
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,740
I can't believe the first day
is so hectic this year.

279
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,470
It's not usually like this, right?

280
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,730
Usually, the last day is the busiest day.

281
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,010
What about lunch? Where should we go?

282
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,050
Have you been to the cafeteria?

283
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,020
No. Is it good?

284
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,320
Not bad. Let's go there.

285
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,050
Okay.

286
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,860
This way.

287
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,570
Chae Hyun-seung!

288
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,170
It's really you.

289
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,410
Long time no see.

290
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,510
Yes, it's been a while.

291
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,350
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,390
Are you here for the campus recruiting?

293
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,220
Yes.

294
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,190
Me too.

295
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,780
I'll go on ahead.

296
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,030
No, Senior Yoon.

297
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,400
Let's go together.

298
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
We're going somewhere.

299
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,840
Sorry. See you when the day's over.

300
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
You're at KLAR, right? I'll go find you.

301
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,240
I have other plans.

302
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,850
I'll get going now.

303
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,580
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

304
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,290
Why are we here?

305
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,940
I told you.

306
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,070
You'll have to carefully
watch your actions.

307
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,410
And that includes what you wear.

308
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,180
I picked out the clothes
that will suit you well.

309
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,820
And they will become
your taste after this.

310
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,620
Let's begin.

311
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,410
This one.

312
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,120
Yes, sir.

313
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,020
You look better than I expected.

314
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,970
Thanks for today.

315
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,550
Don't be.

316
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,020
To some extent, I'm putting
shackles on you.

317
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,820
You'll be criticized non-stop
about your conduct.

318
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,230
About what you must do
and must not do in our family.

319
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,040
By the way, how's your dad?

320
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,700
He hasn't called you yet?

321
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,460
If he sees your marriage announcement,

322
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,210
he'll come to you soon.

323
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,610
Don't worry. That won't happen.

324
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,740
You met him already?

325
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,170
As a courtesy to join your family,

326
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,810
I've taken care of him.

327
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,690
Good job.

328
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,930
We're here.

329
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,300
Can I really go?

330
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,400
They're your friends from college.

331
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,170
The junior we met earlier
told you to come.

332
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,540
Don't be so nervous.

333
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,910
The owner here is our senior.

334
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,980
Everyone is friendly and fun.

335
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,750
It'll be fine.

336
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,970
Since I'm already here,

337
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,250
should I join for a while?

338
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:37,950
Sure.

339
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,460
Okay.

340
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,070
Strawberries, go!

341
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,260
I like strawberries!

342
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,930
Strawberries!

343
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,030
Strawberries!

344
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,160
I'm here!

345
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,270
-Hey!
-Hyun-seung!

346
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,240
Why has it been so long?

347
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,810
-Hey!
-Long time no see!

348
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,980
-Sorry. It's been a while.
-Remember me?

349
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,240
Of course, I remember you.

350
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,950
Where should we sit?

351
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,780
-Over here.
-Okay.

352
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,200
Move over. Here.

353
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,750
Thanks.

354
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,050
Sit here.

355
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,570
-Okay.
-Thank you.

356
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,200
You got lucky with food.
You're here just in time.

357
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,170
Is this the senior
you've been talking about?

358
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:26,670
Yes.

359
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,140
Say hi.

360
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,240
This is the owner I told you about.

361
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,340
Oh, hello...

362
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,940
Sit down.

363
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,010
Oh, okay.

364
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,810
Hello, I'm Yoon Song-ah.
I work with Hyun-seung.

365
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,550
Nice to meet you.

366
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,950
I'm this fool's senior, Kim Jong-hyuk.

367
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,390
You must've gone through a lot
training this fool.

368
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,460
Hyun-seung is really good at his job,

369
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,180
so I receive a lot of help.

370
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,150
You're so kind.

371
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,630
How did you end up with this idiot?

372
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,600
Oh, come on.

373
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,900
What did you say? You need more soju?

374
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,640
Yes!

375
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,390
More soju?

376
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,140
Yes!

377
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,010
Soju!

378
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,010
Hey, guys!

379
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,210
Eat whatever you like today.

380
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,650
Hyun-seung is buying everything!

381
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,320
Ready, go!

382
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,090
Chae Hyun-seung!

383
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,790
Seriously, guys...

384
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,490
Hye-jung's voice wasn't loud enough.

385
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Chae Hyun-seung!

386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,040
Unemployed, alright.

387
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,670
Here come the drinks!

388
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,610
One here.

389
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,480
I'll pour you one.

390
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,300
-Hyun-seung.
-Yes?

391
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,320
How's work? Is it fun?

392
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,380
Work?

393
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,450
It's fun. The office vibe is good.

394
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,060
And there are a lot of
good seniors like her.

395
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,830
Wow, you know how to
lead a good social life!

396
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,130
What about making products?

397
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,960
Can you really make whatever you want?

398
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,060
Not really.

399
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,700
But things do go as marketers plan them.

400
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,870
From product planning
to the container and design,

401
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,440
we control everything.

402
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
Hyun-seung, what's the
best cushion foundation?

403
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,010
Of course it's KLAR.

404
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,180
-Oh, my bad.
-Come on.

405
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,480
By the way, are you wearing makeup?

406
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,450
Yes.

407
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,950
He's unbelievable, Hyun-seung.

408
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,010
He always wears makeup, even during tests.

409
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,090
Great self-discipline.

410
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,190
Hey! It's about my pride.

411
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,180
Of course it is.

412
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,530
You really...

413
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,800
Senior Yoon,

414
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,970
can I have your business card?

415
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,270
My business card?

416
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,900
I want to go to KLAR too.

417
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,910
I want to ask you a bunch of questions.

418
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,080
Hey, shouldn't the order go like this?

419
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,480
Come on, you're still a newbie.

420
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,580
If I have questions,
she'd answer me better.

421
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,550
So move over, please.

422
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,850
Can I have your business card?

423
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,520
Sure, I'll give it to you.

424
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,720
He seized his chance.

425
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,830
I'm so embarrassed.

426
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,690
Thank you.

427
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,100
Can I have one too?

428
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Of course.

429
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,330
If you have any questions,
contact me anytime.

430
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,040
Really? Thank you.

431
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,900
Me too...

432
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,510
No, I'm not drunk!

433
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,880
One, two, three, four!

434
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,450
Orange, orange, oh!

435
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,220
Orange, orange, oh!

436
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,850
-Who?
-Why didn't you catch it?

437
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Me?

438
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,360
Drink! Here goes the shot!

439
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,930
Isn't this too much?

440
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,030
Gulp it down!

441
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,860
Don't sneak away, drink it already!

442
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,070
Rice cake, four.

443
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,500
Rice cake.

444
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,340
Fish cake, eight.

445
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,010
Fish cake!

446
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,740
Okay!

447
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,180
Tuna, tuna...

448
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,200
-No.
-You have to drink.

449
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,770
Come on. Seriously.

450
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,080
Get used to this.

451
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,750
They'll give you a lot of help
from now onward.

452
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,600
Sorry for being late.

453
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,840
This is Jae-shin,
the one I told you about.

454
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,310
Come in.

455
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,450
The sky is spinning in circles.

456
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,320
I think I'm going to die.

457
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,060
Don't worry. People won't die that easily.

458
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,560
No, I mean it.

459
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,720
It's your fault you suck at games.

460
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,730
You slipped and lost every time.

461
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,300
You're too good at it.

462
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,530
You said it was your first time playing,

463
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,710
and yet you never lost.

464
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,010
You didn't even offer to drink for me.

465
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,610
Don't you know my motto?

466
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,260
When training juniors...

467
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,390
You raise them to be strong.

468
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,760
But this is too much, isn't it?

469
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,090
Are you feeling that bad?

470
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,360
I think I'll be okay in a little while.

471
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,000
You should go home.

472
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,970
And hear later that you die on the street?

473
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,340
I knew it.

474
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,540
You're the best.

475
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,900
Get some rest.

476
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,710
Okay.

477
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,350
You must've had a really fun college life.

478
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,290
I guess.

479
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,690
What about you?

480
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,630
It was hard enough just to attend classes.

481
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,400
I tutored kids, worked part-time jobs...

482
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,260
I had no time to make friends,

483
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,240
let alone join club activities.

484
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,050
I wanted to be independent,
so don't feel bad.

485
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,190
Anyway, seeing you today made me jealous.

486
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,330
A college life like that
would've been fun.

487
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,500
And it was different seeing you
as someone else's senior.

488
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,670
I was cool, right?

489
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,430
Yes.

490
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,180
I'll invite you again some time.

491
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,840
I'll invite you anytime, so please come.

492
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,130
The door is wide open.

493
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,670
I think you've sobered up now. Let's go.

494
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,530
Okay.

495
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,510
What's wrong?

496
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
You okay?

497
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,600
No.

498
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,930
Five minutes.

499
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,600
Just stay like this for five minutes.

500
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,600
Who are you?

501
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,820
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE

502
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,480
So you're Jae-shin's father?

503
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,430
Oh, yes.

504
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,400
As it says there, I'm Jae-shin's father.

505
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,540
He's a spitting image of me.

506
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,460
So,

507
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,940
have you heard about me from him?

508
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,880
I only know you exist.

509
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,950
He doesn't like me that much.

510
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,440
I guess that's how it is
between every father and son.

511
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,650
By the way, you're very lovely.

512
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,090
My son has great taste in women,
just like his old man.

513
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,300
How did you find me here?

514
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,470
Well...

515
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,200
The wedding announcement
was huge in the news.

516
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
I did a little digging.
It was easy to find.

517
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,480
I don't have an ulterior motive.

518
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,840
You'll be joining our family now.

519
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,180
I should see you at least once.

520
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,380
It'll be weird to see you
for the first time at the wedding.

521
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,220
You're coming to our wedding?

522
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,290
Of course, I am.

523
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,260
It's my one and only son's wedding.

524
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,990
But don't worry.

525
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,430
I look shabby today
because I was in a rush.

526
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,630
But if I clean myself up,
I'd look like a movie star.

527
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
In order to do that,

528
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,180
I need some money.

529
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,080
Oh, where are you going to live?

530
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,320
How much do you want?

531
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,920
How much?

532
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,990
Tell me.

533
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,520
Come on.

534
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,490
That's not why I come.

535
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,440
I guess I should consider your position.

536
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,240
And I am sort of badly-off these days.

537
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,560
One big one...

538
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,630
No,

539
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,550
two big ones will do.

540
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,350
Why should I?

541
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,060
Huh?

542
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,720
Do I seem

543
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,630
like a pushover to you?

544
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:29,569
No...

545
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,160
Since my daughter-in-law
dutifully offered first...

546
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,460
I told you I didn't come to get anything!

547
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,339
So you don't need the money?

548
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,930
Oh, thank you!

549
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,240
It was inconvenient for me all day
because I lost this.

550
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,070
You're an office worker.

551
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,540
How could you lose your employee card?

552
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,100
You're a newbie and yet
you're already laid-back.

553
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,710
I've been working long enough
to be laid-back.

554
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,390
How confident.

555
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,980
-The food's here.
-Here's your food.

556
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,810
Thank you.

557
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,290
Looks good.

558
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,080
Thank you.

559
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,890
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

560
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,530
My stomach is burning.

561
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,600
You're still very young.

562
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,330
When I was your age,
I drank a crate of soju...

563
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,520
Yes, I know.

564
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,070
You drank a crate of soju
and a crate of beer

565
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,340
but you felt nothing.

566
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,540
I know it all.

567
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,380
Slick as a whistle.

568
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,210
You pretended to be cool
in front of that senior of yours.

569
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,010
Did I?

570
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,750
You like her, don't you?

571
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,490
What are you talking about?

572
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,520
I knew it! I'm right!

573
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,720
It's so obvious. How can she not know?

574
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,660
Is it that obvious?

575
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,700
Geez.

576
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,230
Just tell her.

577
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,990
I should be more careful.

578
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,010
So that I can be around her.

579
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,380
Hey.

580
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,180
Why the sudden sad vibe?

581
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,490
We'll first knead the dough
for buckwheat noodles.

582
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,020
First, put in buckwheat flour.

583
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,660
We also use hard wheat flour.

584
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,030
Kneading with hot water
is called scalding.

585
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:44,330
You use this method to make thin noodles.

586
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,540
Scrub the buckwheat noodles
as hard as you can.

587
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,280
Remove the starch to get a chewy texture.

588
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,980
Oh, this is sesame oil.

589
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,730
They are edible flowers.

590
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,710
Would you like to try it?

591
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,670
Is it good?

592
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,710
It's really good.

593
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,810
Is it?

594
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,890
You're right.

595
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,660
Your cooking is better though.

596
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I agree.

597
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,730
You two must be together.

598
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,500
What?

599
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
You're not?

600
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,470
You seem close.

601
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,930
Oh, no. We're...

602
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,940
Friends.

603
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,810
Just close friends.

604
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,280
Oh, I see. Good for you guys.

605
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,150
You can come to places like this.
I envy you.

606
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,450
It's good to have a friend.

607
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,160
Thank you for today.

608
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,130
I learned a lot.

609
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,230
That's good.

610
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,100
You'll do it then?

611
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,770
Yes. I'll check my schedule
and let you know.

612
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,670
Oh, and...

613
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,400
Sorry about earlier.

614
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,840
I went ahead and said we were friends.

615
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,770
If I said I was your husband's friend,

616
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,010
she'd look at us in a funny way.

617
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,910
Come to think of it, that's possible.

618
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,970
You have a lot of friends, don't you?

619
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,680
I do.

620
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,020
But what's the use?

621
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,890
They're all married
and busy raising their kids.

622
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,960
I got married early.

623
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,350
I was busy raising Ha-eun,

624
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,460
so I couldn't see them.

625
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,800
Now, it's the opposite.

626
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,790
I know all the moms of Ha-eun's friends.

627
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,400
But they are different from my friends.

628
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,570
I guess you're right.

629
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,470
What about you? Do you have many friends?

630
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,310
Not really, I only have Woo-hyun.

631
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,910
It's sad, right?

632
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,970
What's wrong with that?

633
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,580
My husband is the same too.

634
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,650
You're peas in a pod.

635
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,250
By the way, how did you two
become friends?

636
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,690
Oh, about that...

637
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,430
What is it?

638
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,740
PICK UP HA-EUN FOR
NATURE EXPERIENCE CLASS

639
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,110
Sorry, I have to go to my next schedule.

640
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,170
Sure.

641
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,380
-I'll see you next time.
-Bye.

642
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,460
Doctor, that was the last patient.

643
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,720
Okay, well done today.

644
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,580
HAN-SEO

645
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,150
Over here!

646
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,090
That was quick.

647
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,560
We were wrapping up.

648
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,260
Your restaurant?

649
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,490
It's my day off.

650
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,440
You're hosting a cooking class
with my wife?

651
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,680
Yes, I'm going to give it a go.

652
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,750
It's boring managing the restaurant.

653
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,150
It's good that your place
is doing well so quickly.

654
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,020
Has it been six months now?

655
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,520
Yes.

656
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,860
Around that.

657
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,140
Should I prepare what Manager Kwon
asked by tomorrow?

658
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,010
Yes.

659
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,600
You're leaving now?

660
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,610
Yes.

661
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,850
You're getting off work late.

662
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,260
Why are you here?

663
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,630
You didn't answer my texts.

664
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,420
There was no reason to answer.

665
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,110
You're still very angry.

666
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,400
Let's go, Senior Yoon.

667
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,310
I'll keep coming.

668
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,020
Until you agree to meet me.

669
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,200
So?

670
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,570
What do you want to say?

671
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,600
Who was that woman?

672
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,570
Your girlfriend?

673
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,350
It's so strange.

674
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,180
That you're looking at me like this.

675
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,840
If you don't have anything
to say in particular,

676
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,250
I'll leave now.

677
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,780
I miss you so much.

678
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,430
Did you ever think about me?

679
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,340
I know I'm being shameless.

680
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,480
Acting like this after what I did to you.

681
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,540
I thought I made myself clear.

682
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,210
When I say it's the last time,
it's really the last time.

683
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,150
But you still chose him.

684
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,520
I was young.

685
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,420
That's why I preferred someone
who shared the pain.

686
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,990
But in reality, it wore me down.

687
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,360
You always said it'd be fine.

688
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,600
That everything would be alright.
And I missed that.

689
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,600
You're the one

690
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,910
that I really need.

691
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:30,870
Seo-yeon,

692
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,390
you can't do this.

693
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,410
You can't win or discard people
based on your needs.

694
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,210
Also, there's someone I like.

695
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,750
I like her a lot.

696
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,590
Who?

697
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,990
That woman?

698
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,930
Yes.

699
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,220
What about her?

700
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,670
Does she feel the same way?

701
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,870
The important thing is
I'm not going back to you.

702
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,640
Just accept my feelings then.

703
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:08,480
I can't give up on my feelings
just because you like her.

704
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,410
When you grow weary of your crush,

705
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,220
you'll look at me one day, right?

706
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:15,920
I won't become weary.

707
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,150
Even if we get further apart,

708
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,250
I still won't become weary.

709
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,990
Then I'll keep my eyes fixed on you too.

710
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,930
I don't think I'll become weary either.

711
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,830
Don't you think that's an obsession?

712
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,460
It seems to me that we're the same.

713
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,460
You and I.

714
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,700
Unrequited love is nothing more
than a selfish thought.

715
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,300
<i>She's got a lot of nerve! How shameless!</i>

716
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,880
What a jerk.

717
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,490
<i>She's talking a load of trash!
Ignore her!</i>

718
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,740
But it's not that easy.

719
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,890
<i>Of course, it'll trouble your mind.</i>

720
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,690
You said you won't be greedy,

721
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,330
but you can't control your feelings.

722
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,560
But still, there's a way.

723
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,830
<i>Keep your feelings
to yourself till the end.</i>

724
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,870
<i>Because you want to stay by her side.</i>

725
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,580
It'll be hard to keep hiding it.

726
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,460
<i>Geez.</i>

727
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,070
<i>I'm tearing up.</i>

728
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,080
<i>Anyway, Little Brother.</i>

729
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,040
<i>I'll call you Little Brother, okay?</i>

730
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:21,050
<i>From now on, just focus on
your feelings.</i>

731
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,020
<i>Don't look at anything around you.</i>

732
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,290
<i>Just look at your heart.</i>

733
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,220
Okay?

734
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,790
Keep that in mind!

735
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,630
<i>I've been through it.</i>

736
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,610
<i>The same thing as you.</i>

737
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,560
I pretended I didn't know.

738
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,710
I held out, pleading and begging.

739
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,950
That's what I did.

740
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,620
<i>But do you know how it ended?</i>

741
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,620
<i>She dumped me in the end.</i>

742
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:23,140
<i>Unrequited love is nothing more
than a selfish thought.</i>

743
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,150
SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

744
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,180
<i>Are you alright?</i>

745
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,390
Have you been talking all night

746
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,040
without having dinner?

747
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,460
We didn't talk that long.

748
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,350
That woman

749
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,420
is the girl you mentioned before, right?

750
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,920
Is she asking you to get back together?

751
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,400
You read my mind.

752
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,370
It's obvious.

753
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,330
She came to the office
because you ignored her texts.

754
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,710
These people always do that.

755
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,970
They tear you into pieces

756
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,760
and leave you for someone else.

757
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,610
Then, they come back
as though nothing's happened.

758
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,350
It's more appalling that they think
they can undo what's happened.

759
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,920
You must be upset.

760
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,660
Not that much.

761
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,860
Don't lie.

762
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,030
Your face says otherwise.

763
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,900
It's okay.

764
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,740
I used to be such a mess in front of you.

765
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,810
Did something else happen?

766
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,550
Are you worried?

767
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,620
Of course.

768
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,820
Why?

769
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
What do you mean why?

770
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,370
Because you're a junior that I value.

771
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,540
Senior Yoon.

772
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,480
Yes? Talk to me.

773
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,450
The more I think about it,

774
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,820
the more I realize I'm being too greedy.

775
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,240
I still like you a lot.

776
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,900
I don't want to
keep the distance I promised.

777
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,270
I was lying.

778
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,510
I want to stay by your side
even if it's like this.

779
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,550
I was going to hide my feelings,

780
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,780
but it'll come out eventually.

781
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,780
Then you'll be shocked again

782
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,070
and feel sorry for me.

783
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,160
I'll become a burden to you.

784
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,670
I don't want to see you like that again.

785
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,140
So I'm going to give you up.

786
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,810
I'll try to become distant from you.

787
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,220
When you say no, it means no.

788
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,060
So don't be surprised if I seem different.

789
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,330
And don't be hurt.

790
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,470
I can't be the same as before.

791
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,910
All my friends say you're awesome.

792
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,840
They're asking if you can set them up
with your friends.

793
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,850
There's only Jae-woon.

794
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,150
There's no one then.

795
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,720
I need to keep my conscience clear.

796
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,190
Thanks.

797
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,320
For meeting up with my friends.

798
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,160
By the way, I met your father
earlier today.

799
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,690
My father?

800
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,070
Yes. He came to my studio.

801
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,540
He saw our wedding article.

802
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,960
I think he came to me
because he was afraid to go to you.

803
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,070
What did he say?

804
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,340
Seemed like he can barely make ends meet.

805
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,710
Why didn't you call me?

806
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,160
I thought about it,

807
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,070
but I didn't want to stress you out.

808
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,450
I took care of him.

809
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,450
He's no longer my father.

810
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,790
So don't give him money ever again.

811
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,730
Don't even talk to him.

812
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,630
Did I make a mistake?

813
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,490
<i>So I'm going to give you up.</i>

814
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
I'll try to become distant from you.

815
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,430
Iced Americano with two shots of espresso

816
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,170
and two pumps of vanilla syrup.

817
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,570
Okay.

818
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,340
Oh! Song-ah!

819
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,610
Oh, hello.

820
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,820
You're here alone?

821
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:42,750
Yes.

822
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,990
When will they send
the new eyeshadow sample?

823
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,890
They said within this week,
but I'll check again.

824
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,120
Okay.

825
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,530
By the way,

826
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,060
Hyun-seung's new product idea is great.

827
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,030
The team leader pulled out a list.

828
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,800
Hyun-seung is on the presentation list.

829
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Really?

830
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,270
The official email will be sent tomorrow,

831
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,740
but you can tell him in advance.

832
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,710
Okay.

833
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,480
How do you feel?

834
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,660
I knew you'd make the PowerPoint list.

835
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,400
All that's left is the first place.

836
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,730
I'll do my best.

837
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,300
What do you mean?

838
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,920
You'll win first place
even without doing your best.

839
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,340
What are you doing there, Song-ah?

840
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,040
Song-ah,

841
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,800
Hyun-seung made the presentation list.

842
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,680
Congratulations. You worked hard.

843
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,150
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

844
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,590
Come on.

845
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,190
Let's go out for drinks.

846
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,120
To wish for first place.
What do you think?

847
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,860
I'm in.

848
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,360
Of course, you are.

849
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,030
How about you?

850
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,800
Sure.

851
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,060
Of course, you're the hero.

852
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,600
What do you want to eat?

853
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,470
Anything's fine.

854
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,300
We should go where you want to go.

855
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,640
Cheers!

856
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,920
Wow! This is so good!

857
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,690
You must order makgeolli
and pajeon on rainy days.

858
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,530
You used Hyun-seung
as an excuse to drink, right?

859
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,060
Kind of.

860
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,390
It's a good day to drink together.

861
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,000
I'll order fried pepper.

862
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,370
Ma'am, fried pepper
and assorted jeon, please!

863
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,240
Okay.

864
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,010
Do you want anything?

865
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,540
No, you ordered everything.

866
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,380
I'll just eat that.

867
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,750
I wanted beef jeon though.

868
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,020
Why are you feeling down?

869
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,080
Just drink.

870
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,520
Yes, let's drink.

871
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,590
-You're very tactful.
-Of course.

872
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,560
Okay.

873
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,580
No one is going home early, okay?

874
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,760
No one will go.

875
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,760
Hyun-seung!

876
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,360
First place!

877
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,230
Go for it!

878
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,750
Go for it!

879
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,200
Listen to the sound of rain.

880
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,240
I hope the food comes soon.

881
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,580
Cheers!

882
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,450
I knew it.

883
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,720
He can't hold his liquor.

884
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,620
Where is Song-ah anyway?

885
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,890
Why don't you go look for her, Hyun-seung?

886
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,560
Yes, you should go.

887
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,370
The youngest one should step up.

888
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,270
Okay, I'll go look for her then.

889
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:56,540
I told you it's a crush.

890
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,110
They're flirting.

891
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,680
I said they're dating.

892
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,250
I heard it with my own ears.

893
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,450
I saw it with my own eyes.

894
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,950
They held hands and ran.

895
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,020
They held hands again?

896
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,020
Again? When?

897
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,750
Geez! What is this?

898
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,050
I got it.

899
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:11,960
Today,

900
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,490
no one is leaving early.

901
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,830
We'll go to work in the morning.

902
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:16,800
Go back to sleep.

903
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,130
Sleep well, Manager Kwon.

904
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,800
It started in Samcheok.

905
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,440
It doesn't make sense
if they're still not dating.

906
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,570
Maybe the crush became a relationship,

907
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,810
then they broke up

908
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,080
and now they're flirting.

909
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,310
Geez! What is it?

910
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:31,940
Seriously.

911
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,280
Relationships are so complicated.

912
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,620
I give up.

913
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,180
-They're flirting.
-Go back to sleep.

914
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,580
Are you okay?

915
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,610
Yes.

916
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,680
What about you?

917
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,050
Me too.

918
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,470
I'll go back inside.

919
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,300
Okay.

920
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:50,790
Oh...

921
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,530
I'm sorry.

922
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,500
It's okay.

923
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,870
I'm going in now.

924
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:03,870
Okay.

925
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:39,170
First, the selling points of Aqua Cushion.

926
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,810
There are two things you need to remember.

927
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,880
Triple functional cosmetics.

928
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,750
Dermatologically tested
for sensitive skin.

929
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,980
Remember these two aspects.

930
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,010
Specifically, it brightens the skin,
treats wrinkles

931
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,660
and blocks UV rays.
It has three functions.

932
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,020
Take note of that.

933
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,090
It's best for those who want to moisturize

934
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:02,130
and those who want
a skin-lightening effect...

935
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:02,860
Hi.

936
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,400
Hello.

937
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,300
Where is Manager Ahn?

938
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,470
She'll be here later.

939
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,570
The previous training session
hasn't ended yet.

940
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,400
Wait in the next lecture room,
I'll call for you.

941
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,260
Okay.

942
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,480
Inflacin X that helps soothe the skin...

943
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,960
You're here.

944
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,070
Where's Manager Ahn?

945
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,210
She went to solve issues
with the new product.

946
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,370
Oh.

947
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,270
Is it serious?

948
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,340
One of the materials for the container
is running late.

949
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,030
How is it going with your presentation?

950
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:15,600
Good.

951
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,650
{\an8}TRAINING TEAM MANAGER KIM SO-MIN

952
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,650
<i>You can come in five minutes later.</i>

953
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,250
If I don't like this,

954
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,110
I become the bad person, is it?

955
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:27,940
I can't ask you if you need any help.

956
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,850
We can't laugh together anymore.

957
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,120
I can't even look at you in the eyes.

958
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,960
I don't like this.

959
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,390
I'm the bad person, right?

960
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:50,920
Even so,

961
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,740
I'll just be the bad person.

962
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,870
So don't give up.

963
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,210
Don't become distant

964
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,770
from me.
