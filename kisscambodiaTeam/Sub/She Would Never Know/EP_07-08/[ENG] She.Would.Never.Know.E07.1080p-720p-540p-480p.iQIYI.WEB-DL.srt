[All places, characters, firms and events

3
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,330
Sorry. I dozed off.


4
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,330
Get some sleep.


5
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,400
We did a lot already.


6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,170
But there's still a lot left.


7
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,810
I'm awake now.


8
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,220
No, stop.


9
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,039
Just get some kip.


10
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,479
You can barely keep your eyes open.


11
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,420
I usually go to bed early.


12
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,880
Lie down for half an hour.


13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,950
Don't worry, I'll wake you up.


14
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,270
Should I?


15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,020
I'll switch with you when I wake up.


16
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Okay.


17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Oh, wait.


18
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
Wait for a second.


19
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,800
Take this.


20
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,940
Are you okay? You're all wet.


21
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,970
I'm okay.


22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,100
Quick.


23
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,230
Lie down here. Use that as a blanket.


24
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,760
Come quickly before you're fully awake.


25
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,780
Dry yourself. You'll catch a cold.


26
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,280
I can brush it off. It's okay.


27
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Sit down.


28
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,790
Now.


29
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,450
Can I ask you something?


30
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
Why do you like me?


31
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,330
I'm just curious.


32
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,880
It wasn't love at first sight.


33
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,450
Excuse me!


34
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,020
Are you here for career counseling?


35
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,230
[At first...]


36
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,860
Then I'll see you at work next time.


37
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,530
[I wanted to see you once again.]


38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,360
[I hoped to see you again.]


39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,870
[That's how I felt.]


40
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,310
When I saw you again,


41
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,170
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.


42
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,280
[You're kind and passionate,
just as I thought.]


43
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,490
I learned about your thoughts,
actions and expressions.


44
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,920
Learning more about you was great.


45
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,530
I don't know exactly when
I started to like you.


46
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
Nor do I know why.


47
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,730
It's just...


48
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,900
It's just because it's you.


49
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,510
I like you because you're you.


50
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,110
I think when you like someone,


51
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,530
that's what happens.


52
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,000
You see only what you want to see.


53
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,630
You think you've known enough
about that person.


54
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,100
But


55
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,970
you are mistaken.


56
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,110
I'm not that great of a person.


57
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm more foolish than you think.


58
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,180
And I'm pathetic.


59
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,900
Also,


60
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,270
I'm a bad person.


61
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,470
So...


62
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,150
So your heart is too big for me.


63
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,170
For a person like me to accept.


64
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,090
This is the only answer I can give you.


65
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,430
Warm yourself up.


66
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,310
I'll wait.


67
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,490
I can wait.
I won't make you uncomfortable.


68
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,190
I'll wait.


69
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm sorry.


70
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,150
[Episode 7]


71
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,690
What are you doing?


72
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,710
Hey, baby.


73
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,680
You're late.


74
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,050
Some of them aren't right for you.


75
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,690
I thought I bought all your clothes,


76
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,410
but there are some tacky ones
mixed in here.


77
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,260
Did you buy them yourself?


78
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,150
Your taste isn't that good.


79
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,470
Leave them. I'll organize it.


80
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,130
You're busy. I'll do it.


81
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,669
We'll move into our new place soon.


82
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,840
I have to clean it out anyway.


83
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,850
I said I'll do it.


84
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,690
Okay then, you do it.


85
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,550
You look awfully drunk.


86
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,690
Is something wrong?


87
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,800
No.


88
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,250
You'd better go now.


89
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Jae-shin.


90
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,680
Your current place suits you the best.


91
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,880
As my brother's friend
and right next to me.


92
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Just in case you forget.


93
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,190
Sometimes you get confused about
where you fit the best.


94
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,030
You look tired. Wash up and get some rest.


95
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,160
I'll get going now.


96
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,300
You must've worked awfully hard.
You did it all.


97
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,430
Looks like you did stay up all night.


98
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,040
Are you going back to the office?


99
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,700
No, they told us to take the day off.


100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,080
Okay, drive safely back to Seoul.


101
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,590
-We'll leave the rest up to you.
-Sure, don't worry.


102
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,780
-Thank you.
-Sure.


103
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Let's go.


104
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,790
Okay.


105
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,800
Let me know if you're sleepy. I can drive.


106
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,800
Okay.


107
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,150
Shall we listen to the radio?


108
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,580
[Morning Discovery.
This is your host, Lee Ji-hye.]


109
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,920
[We have a letter from
Mapo-gu Lovesick Guy.]


110
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,420
[There's something about his nickname.]


111
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,360
[Hello.]


112
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,850
[I'm a 27-year-old guy
who recently confessed my love]


113
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,370
[to a senior at work and got rejected.]


114
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,530
[My condolences to you, sir.]


115
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,060
[It rained yesterday.]


116
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,750
[You know that vibe.]


117
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,110
[So I confessed my love for her,
like a man.]


118
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,150
[But she said younger men
aren't her type.]


119
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,750
[A guy's heart isn't a joke.]


120
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,450
[Just because I'm younger,
my feelings don't matter, is it?]


121
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,060
[I was so hurt that...]


122
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,890
Let's just drive quietly.


123
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,440
We'll soon hit the rest stop.


124
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Let's get something to eat.


125
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,180
Okay.


126
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,910
Hello, this is Chae Hyun-seung.


127
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,180
Oh, hello.


128
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,510
The Beauty Class banner company?


129
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,250
I'm not sure.


130
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,920
I think...


131
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,390
I'll ask Manager Kang and get back to you.


132
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,690
Okay, I'll call you back
as soon as possible.


133
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,730
I'll go on ahead.


134
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,330
Okay.


135
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,510
Happy birthday to you!


136
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,450
Happy birthday to you!


137
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,930
Happy birthday, dear Ha-eun!


138
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,360
Happy birthday to you!


139
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,640
You must have worked hard
to prepare everything.


140
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,150
I have to do this to
stop her from nagging me.


141
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,770
Where did you order the lunchboxes?


142
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,910
They were so pretty.


143
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,240
Could you pass me the info?


144
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,340
I want to order it for Ye-na's birthday.


145
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,350
I asked my husband's friend to do it.
He's a chef.


146
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,950
-From that restaurant?
-Yes.


147
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,550
Ha-eun asked, so I called him
and he said yes.


148
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,560
His recipes are really special indeed.


149
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,860
I tried to copy him at home,
but it didn't taste the same.


150
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,900
I guess that's why he's a famous chef.


151
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,930
I couldn't even think of copying him.


152
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,370
Could you ask him
if he can teach us his recipe?


153
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,210
His recipe?


154
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,540
I know it's not easy.


155
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,250
But I won't tell others.


156
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,210
I'll pay him handsomely.


157
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,950
I don't know if I can ask him that.


158
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,740
Come on, please.


159
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,550
Ask him if he's up for teaching a class.


160
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,120
Small restaurants these days
do that a lot.


161
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,460
Is that so?


162
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,560
Sounds great!


163
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,060
Alright, I'm in!


164
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,960
Me too.


165
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,830
Me too.


166
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,130
Okay, I'll ask him.


167
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,270
But don't get your hopes up.


168
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,210
I'm sorry to call you here.


169
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,440
I was suddenly short on ingredients.


170
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,000
It's okay.
I'm glad you could make time to see me.


171
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,020
And I can do my grocery shopping too.


172
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,820
I should get some of these.


173
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,350
What did you want to ask me?


174
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,830
Oh, about that...


175
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,700
Are you interested
in teaching a cooking class?


176
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,130
A cooking class?


177
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,500
Your recipe is special.


178
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,570
So people around me
are hyped to learn from you.


179
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,640
Just four people including me.


180
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,680
You too?


181
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,580
Yes. I love your cooking.


182
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,210
But I don't know if I can.


183
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,520
You're too busy, is it?

363
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,880
I know.


364
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,710
Don't worry.


365
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,480
Are you leaving, Hyun-seung?


366
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,380
Want to go for a drink?


367
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm going to do a brainstorming session


368
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,220
with my recruit buddies.


369
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,720
You're starting on that already?


370
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,460
Yes, I'm starting early.


371
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,770
Wow, he never half-asses it.


372
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,920
-He's like me.
-As if.


373
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,070
Hyun-seung, do you know MLB?


374
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,580
The LA Dodgers?


375
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,930
Yes, I do.


376
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,900
They won Rookie of the Year
for five years in a row.


377
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,010
In 1992, Eric Karros.


378
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,240
-In 1993, Mike Piazza.
-Piazza.


379
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,310
In 1994...


380
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,350
Raul Mondesi.


381
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,010
That's right.


382
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,720
-In 1995...
-Nomo Hideo.


383
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,020
-How did you know?
-Get to the point.


384
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,750
Well, I mean...


385
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,650
We can win first place 3 years in a row.


386
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,560
Hyun-seung, fight on!


387
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,690
-Thanks.
-You can do it!


388
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,330
If you don't know something, ask Song-ah.


389
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,530
Of course, she'll teach you well anyway.


390
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,230
She won first place no matter what.


391
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,030
Good luck.


392
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,550
Thanks.


393
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,330
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.


394
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,400
Manager Ahn, do you want to grab dinner?


395
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Hey...


396
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,500
Let's go eat.


397
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Hey, guys.


398
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,740
Hello.


399
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,370
Are you working late too?


400
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,970
Yes.


401
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you want to get dinner with us?


402
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,170
It's okay, it won't take long.


403
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,110
Go eat.


404
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,380
Then treat us to dinner next time, please.


405
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,680
Hyun-seung has been
complimenting you non-stop.


406
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,350
I'm sick and tired of it.


407
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,650
There's no time. Let's go.


408
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,350
No time?


409
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,780
We have a tight schedule.


410
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
-Really?
-Let's go eat quickly.


411
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,790
-Do we have to go now?
-Come on.


412
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,060
-I'll look forward to that dinner!
-Forget it. Come on.


413
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,160
Bye.


414
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,130
Let's go! We don't have much time.


415
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,300
I'll get going too.


416
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,270
Enjoy your dinner.


417
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,010
Thanks. Goodbye.


418
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,340
Hurry up!


419
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,940
I'm coming!


420
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,320
Absorbs into my skin.


421
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,160
Ah, it's so refreshing.


422
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,190
Goodness. What are you doing, Director?


423
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,930
Director Lee is becoming beautiful!


424
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,560
Hey! I just put it on!


425
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,400
You won't get prettier with this.


426
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
How displeasing to my eyes.


427
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,490
If you act this way after you get married,


428
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,670
you'd be in trouble.


429
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,810
Mind your own business.


430
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,210
Right.


431
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,710
Why did you change the dress shop?


432
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,280
Why?


433
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,050
You even changed the date
to match their schedule.


434
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,020
Why'd you change shops?


435
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,350
I heard the news today.


436
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,020
It didn't satisfy my expectation.


437
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,320
Empty vessels make the most sound.


438
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,420
Maybe it's because you were fussy?


439
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,380
You should've gone to a better place then.


440
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,960
They leaked your photo.


441
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,770
We'll make an official statement soon.


442
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,340
Jae-shin agreed to it.


443
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
He did?


444
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,670
Yes. He didn't want you to be criticized.


445
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,880
Thanks anyway.


446
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,680
Lunch tomorrow? It's on me.


447
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
No. I'm busy all weekend.


448
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,150
Doing what? You have nothing to do.


449
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,860
This time, I do.


450
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,490
And it's very important to me.


451
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,130
How about a melting mask
that you can sleep on it?


452
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,530
I think that already exists.


453
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,270
Really?


454
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,940
Everything I say already exists.


455
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,620
Then what isn't there?


456
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,540
How about this?


457
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,950
Highly concentrated ampoule
on top and essence below it.


458
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,740
When you turn the container
for the first time,


459
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,140
the ampoule drops
and mixes with the essence.


460
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,660
Ampoule essence.


461
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,420
You're a genius.


462
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,790
Can you give that idea to me?


463
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,430
It exists.


464
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,460
Seriously, I quit! I quit!


465
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,000
Do we have to consider the prime cost?


466
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,170
I think so, feasibility is
one of the evaluation criteria.


467
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,210
I'm thinking about adopting
a disposable ampoule


468
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,240
to the container Hyun-seung suggested.


469
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,280
Sounds good.


470
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,610
I don't know if we can make
that kind of container.


471
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,080
It's disposable
so it has to be super small,


472
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,790
but it'll be more expensive.


473
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,650
Right.


474
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,890
How much will a container cost?


475
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,730
What?


476
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,090
She's still here.


477
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,890
Who?


478
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,900
Your senior.


479
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,810
Senior Yoon.


480
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,480
Yes?


481
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,130
We were talking and we wanted
to ask you something.


482
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,720
What is it?


483
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,290
We want to make
a disposable container that mixes


484
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,620
the top layer and bottom layer
when twisted.


485
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,630
Will it be possible to make one
in such a small size?


486
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,130
It's possible.


487
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,030
It doesn't have to be turned.


488
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,070
You can find another way too.


489
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,340
Then what about the prime price?


490
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,790
It's fine as long as
it's not ridiculously high.


491
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,240
Don't worry about it.


492
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,480
It's hard enough to think of a new idea.


493
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,580
It'll be harder if you
need to consider that.


494
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,280
Okay. Thank you.


495
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,520
Are you heading home now?


496
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,560
Yes.


497
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,890
Are you okay?


498
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,890
About what?


499
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,800
Today's article.


500
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,980
I shouldn't ask these things anymore.


501
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,770
I'm sorry.


502
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,310
No, it's okay.


503
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,840
It's not like I didn't know.


504
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,150
That's a relief.


505
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,680
Also...


506
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,450
If you, by any chance,
have any other questions, you can ask.


507
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,220
Okay.


508
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,230
Get home safely.


509
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,490
Okay.


510
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,180
Did something happen between you and her?


511
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,580
What?


512
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,390
You two seemed awkward.


513
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,550
Different from usual.


514
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,870
No, nothing happened.


515
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,590
Why would we seem awkward?


516
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,270
Do you want to do
market research with me tomorrow?


517
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,330
Let's do it separately.


518
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,400
The clerks will notice
if we show up together.


519
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay, then.


520
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,950
Welcome! We're KLAR!


521
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,800
Welcome.


522
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,540
I'll contact you
when the design is completed.


523
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,080
Okay. I look forward to it.


524
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,780
Leave it to us.


525
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,750
-Okay.
-Thanks.


526
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,980
Take care.


527
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,950
Bye.


528
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,280
You're exhausted, right?


529
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,920
You've got no time to rest this weekend.


530
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
I am.


531
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,090
You'll soon be able to buy the lipstick
you were looking for.


532
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,830
When you get the word,
come anytime you want.


533
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,470
I'll doll up and wait for you.


534
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,270
-Manager.
-Yes, ma'am.


535
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,370
Department stores close at 8:30 p.m.
on the weekends, right?


536
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,810
Yes.


537
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,440
Why?


538
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,310
Nothing.


539
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,220
I'll be in my office.


540
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,510
Let me know when the next client comes.


541
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,810
Sure.


542
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,580
I shouldn't ask these things anymore.


543
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,430
I'm sorry.


544
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,640
Why make that face?


545
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,410
Huh? What?


546
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,210
Huh?


547
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,890
Did something happen?


548
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,350
No.


549
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,760
You have plans today?


550
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,360
Not really.


551
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,660
Let's go out.


552
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Where to?


553
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm at Garosu-gil right now.


554
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,170
[Do you want to meet up
at our usual place later?]


555
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,560
Again?


556
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,340
Please don't interfere with my weekend.


557
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,630
[You jerk.]


558
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,980
[Never mind. Bye.]


559
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,180
What the...


560
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,950
What do you think?


561
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,280
It's pretty.


562
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,560
Good. I'm going with this.


563
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,690
Aren't you getting anything?


564
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,730
I don't need anything.


565
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,590
You don't buy clothes
because you need them.


566
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,330
You look around and buy some pretty stuff.


567
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,469
It's on me. Choose something.


568
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,739
You don't have money to buy me clothes.


569
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,300
Come here.


570
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,780
Wow, there are lots of
pretty clothes here.


571
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,810
This is pretty.


572
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,219
How about this?
Just buy this. It's pretty.


573
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,280
I can't wear this to work.


574
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,550
Wear it well.


575
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,760
Okay.


576
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,909
Tell me when you need something.


577
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll buy it for you.


578
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,630
You never owe someone, do you?


579
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,050
Anyway, I'm so hungry.


580
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,400
-Want to eat something?
-Yes.


581
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,570
What should we have?


582
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,929
Huh?


583
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,540
What?


584
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,840
ABM Chae Hyun-seung!


585
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,590
Hey, Ga-young!


586
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,550
Hello!


587
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,350
Oh, hi.


588
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,480
What brings you here?


589
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
We were shopping.


590
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,650
I came to do market research.


591
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,920
But it's the weekend.


592
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Song-ah trained you to be a workaholic.


593
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,830
You two are the same.


594
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,730
Hi.


595
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,020
You must be busy.


596
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,100
You can go if you want.


597
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,240
Okay.


598
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,580
Have you had lunch?


599
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,640
Hey!


600
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,310
We're on our way to lunch.


601
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,950
If you haven't had it yet, join us.


602
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,880
You have to eat alone if you go home.


603
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,350
Let's go, come on!


604
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,870
Let's go!


605
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,290
Hey, Ga-young.


606
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,350
Cheers!


607
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,900
It's so good.


608
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,700
Eat up, ABM Chae. I'm buying.


609
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,460
No, it's on me.


610
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,440
No, I dragged you here, so I'm buying.


611
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,070
Okay.


612
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,240
What a coincidence


613
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,910
to run into each other here!


614
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,680
Right?


615
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,580
I was wondering how you were doing.


616
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,120
Why didn't you come by the store nowadays?


617
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,820
Actually, my work assignment has changed.


618
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Why so?


619
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,530
I work on skincare and
door-to-door channel now.


620
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,520
Then what about Song-ah?


621
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,300
You don't work with her anymore?


622
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,870
No.


623
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,010
So that's why you were down and low.


624
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,810
What are you talking about?


625
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,280
Why have you become so thin?


626
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,910
Eat up, okay? Here.


627
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,010
Well, I...


628
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,650
She doesn't like skinny guys.


629
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,760
Eat up.


630
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,650
Hey!


631
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,290
Alright. I'll give you some, too. Wait.


632
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,090
Here comes the meat. Open your mouth.


633
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,130
Ow, it's hot.


634
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,210
I'll cool it down for you.


635
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,430
Here.


636
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,300
It's okay, right?


637
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,470
Eat.


638
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
What's taking her so long in the bathroom?


639
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,770
Does the market research help?


640
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,470
Yes, more or less.


641
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,000
This won't do.


642
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,850
I'll go check on her.


643
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,930
[Kim Ga-young]


644
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,910
[I suddenly got a severe stomachache.]


645
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,650
[So I'm going home.]


646
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,870
[Don't desert the ABM. Walk him home.]


647
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,970
[Come home as late as you want.]


648
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,470
Kim Ga-young!


649
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,240
Why? What did she say?


650
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,510
Oh...


651
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,080
She went home because of a stomachache.


652
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,540
Is it bad?


653
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,920
It's nothing to worry about.


654
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,730
Should we say goodbye here?


655
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,440
Sure.


656
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,540
Tell Ga-young it was good seeing her.


657
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,750
Manager Kang?


658
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,980
It's really Manager Kang.


659
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,420
You're right.


660
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,640
Run!


661
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,740
What?


662
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,240
Run! Now!


663
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,090
Your shoe.


664
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Are you okay?


665
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,670
Let's go.


666
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
It'll be okay now, right?


667
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,500
Yes.


668
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,950
I'm so exhausted.


669
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,050
-Senior Yoon.
-Yes?


670
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,660
Why were we running?


671
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,530
I don't know.


672
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,060
Why did we run?


673
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,440
Did I tell you to run?


674
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,410
You told me to run just now.


675
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,930
How could you forget?


676
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,280
Hey, you ran with me.


677
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm so exhausted.


678
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,570
Ow, it hurts.


679
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,560
Hello!


680
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,900
-Goodbye.
-Bye.


681
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,830
You're here.


682
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,690
Get me a glass of water.


683
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,160
Is something wrong?


684
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,530
You said you had an errand.


685
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,770
It's nothing.


686
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,460
Weren't you busy today?


687
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,770
No, we didn't have that many customers.


688
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,220
I'll go inside and rest for a while.


689
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,460
What's up with her?


690
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,300
How's your foot?


691
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,730
It's okay.


692
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,940
You really don't exercise, do you?


693
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,510
You seemed out of breath.


694
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,510
I know. I need to exercise, right?


695
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,180
If I assess my metabolic age,


696
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,350
it'd say I'm in my 50s.


697
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,680
You went too far.


698
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,380
Okay, then maybe in my 40s?


699
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,390
70s.


700
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,150
In your 70s.


701
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,060
What?


702
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,690
What did you buy?


703
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,700
Oh, this?


704
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,450
It's not my taste,


705
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,700
but Ga-young bought it for me.


706
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,170
It must be a dress or a skirt.


707
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,540
How do you know so well?


708
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,760
What I said that time...


709
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,800
I hope you're not too hurt by it.


710
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,270
I know I've been pushing you away.


711
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,010
And it's ridiculous to say this now.


712
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,790
But I've been wanting to say this.


713
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,750
I hope you don't make that face.


714
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,390
You're not the problem.


715
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,100
For now,


716
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,830
I don't think I can handle anyone.


717
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,470
I don't want to be scared or swayed


718
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,010
by the wounds that jerk gave me.


719
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,110
But I can't help it right now.


720
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,820
Anyway, thanks.


721
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,990
I feel less pathetic.


722
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,560
Thanks to you.


723
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,660
I won't forget that.


724
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,890
Are you


725
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,750
never going to see me again?


726
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,240
You talk as if you'll never see me again.


727
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,040
Why would I not see you?


728
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,710
That's enough for me.


729
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,850
Actually, I knew it from the start.


730
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,010
I wanted you to be mine


731
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,620
when I interfered in your relationship.


732
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,720
I knew I was being selfish.


733
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,500
So I didn't expect a lot from the start.


734
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,030
But I'm a greedy guy.


735
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,310
Seeing you smiling at me made me think.


736
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,880
I thought things might really
go well with you.


737
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,150
I thought I might really
become your boyfriend.


738
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,320
So it was my fault.


739
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,040
I'm sorry.


740
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,160
I made you say difficult words.


741
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,210
Anyway...


742
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,860
If I can keep seeing you like this,


743
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,910
I'd be content.


744
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,310
I'll maintain the distance
if that's what you wish.


745
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,610
Like now. Like this.


746
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,080
Is that okay?


747
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,850
Why aren't you stretching?


748
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,510
I said I don't want to.


749
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,150
Why do you want to jog?
You've never done it before.


750
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,090
That's why I need to start jogging now.


751
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,590
If my metabolic age is 70, so is yours.


752
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,620
We won't be able to run in a war.


753
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,730
We'll just die.


754
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,820
What era are you living in?


755
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,170
If there is a war,


756
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,600
bombs will come flying and boom!


757
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,870
We all just die.


758
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,600
I'm leaving.


759
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,410
-Where are you going?
-Hey!


760
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,240
Run! Go!


761
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,420
This is nice.


762
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,780
Indeed.


763
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,620
Shall we hang it in our new home?


764
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,850
If you like it.


765
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,800
What?


766
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
I'm happy.


767
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,530
It's been so long since we went on a date.


768
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,070
I'll take more care of you from now on.


769
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,960
I won't make you upset like last time.


770
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,470
You'll be even busier
once you go to Europe,


771
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,110
so let's go on lots of dates.


772
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,480
Okay.


773
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,180
-Just a second.
-Okay.


774
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,480
Who is it?


775
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,760
I don't know this number.


776
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,490
You ignore it?


777
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,560
What if it's work?


778
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,030
They'll call back.


779
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,230
Don't worry about it.


780
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,010
Why isn't he picking up?


781
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,740
I sent him the account number long ago.


782
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,200
-Hey, Lee!
-Yes, sir!


783
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:18,880
Over here.


784
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,720
Yes, sir. I'm coming.


785
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,210
Thank you.


786
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,130
Throw it in.


787
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,660
Let's do this.


788
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,800
Go around.


789
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,300
Throw it in.


790
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,400
I'll keep going then.


791
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,670
No one is throwing it in.


792
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,040
Today's the last day of the promotion.


793
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,040
Why isn't she coming?


794
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,100
Director Lee Jae-woon.


795
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,950
Executive Director!


796
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,520
What brings you here on a weekend?


797
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,880
I just came to see
if everything is going well.


798
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,230
Let's have a cup of tea.
It's been so long.


799
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,230
Right now?


800
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,530
Are you busy?


801
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,990
No. Let's go then.


802
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,740
Okay. This way.


803
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,840
[Relaunch]


804
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,490
Welcome! We're KLAR!


805
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,050
Are you looking for something?


806
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,510
Sorry.


807
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,870
Do you have the relaunched lipstick?


808
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,030
That one?


809
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,040
We sold the last one just a moment ago.


810
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,180
I guess I'm too late.


811
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,550
I'm sorry.


812
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,520
No, it's okay. Have a nice day.


813
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,930
Take a look.


814
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,440
Open it.


815
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,560
I reproduced it for someone.


816
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,900
That someone must have it.


817
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,830
Thank you for this.


818
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,570
I didn't say it's free.


819
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,340
My name is Lee Jae-woon.


820
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,810
What's your name?


821
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,080
It's Chae Ji-seung.


822
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,360
Chae Ji-seung.


823
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,880
Am I done with the payment?


824
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,950
One more thing.


825
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:11,950
Am I one of the reasons you came today?


826
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,530
If I don't answer that,


827
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,260
do I need to return the lipstick?


828
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,260
No.


829
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:22,600
You already paid for that
when you showed up today.


830
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,720
I wanted to get more,
but I guess it won't work.


831
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:34,980
I don't want my interest
to be a burden to you.


832
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,280
Do you have a business card?


833
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,350
Let's set up a date formally next time.


834
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,850
Lee Jae-woon.


835
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,070
Yikes!


836
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,210
What is it, ma'am?


837
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,540
What kind of eyeshadow are you wearing?


838
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,380
What?


839
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,290
Eyeshadow?


840
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,190
I'm testing a new one.


841
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,830
Is that so? Looks good on you.


842
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,830
Thank you.


843
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,800
What's up with you?


844
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,370
You never give compliments.


845
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,130
I'm just stating a fact.


846
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,700
Yes, I'm sure that was it.


847
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,290
Stop laughing.


848
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,830
Wait.


849
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:47,860
What is it?


850
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,090
Tell me if you need anything.


851
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,190
Today's snack?


852
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,120
Instant noodles.


853
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,900
I'm going insane.


854
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,170
Stop laughing! Seriously!


855
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,610
Why can't I laugh?


856
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,540
You want noodles too?


857
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,610
Go help yourself.


858
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,560
Noodles, my butt.


859
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,600
[Does your father still visit?]


860
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:39,270
Blood ties and attachment
make you incompetent.


861
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,540
[Your position is out of your league.]


862
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,960
[So get your act straight.]


863
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,020
[Myungjin Inn]


864
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
That darn jerk.


865
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,750
Why'd he say he'd give me money?


866
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,020
Darn it.


867
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,520
I should've gotten a better settlement.


868
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,720
Sheesh.


869
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,680
Come in.


870
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,320
You should've told me you're coming.


871
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,100
What are you doing? Sit down.


872
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,070
What did you do with the money
you took from me?


873
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,540
Like you gave me a lot.


874
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,110
Some might think you gave me millions.


875
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,170
Never mind that.


876
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,390
Why didn't you answer my calls?


877
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,750
Why haven't you sent the money?


878
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,150
What do you do for a living?


879
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,520
You never care about me.


880
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,030
Why did you ask?


881
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,750
Are you playing a good son now?


882
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,800
How much do you want?


883
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,980
Let's disown each other.


884
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,270
How much will it take to do that?


885
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,440
What?


886
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,420
So you want to sever blood ties
by paying me?


887
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,520
Make a choice.


888
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,390
Take the money and cut ties with me.


889
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,620
Or get no money and watch me die.


890
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,300
How dare you threaten me!


891
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,010
How much can you give me?


892
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,350
Name a price.


893
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,830
300 million won.


894
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,980
Give me 300 million won then.


895
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,070
[300 million won has been
deposited to your bank account.]


896
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:35,040
From this moment onward,
I have no father.


897
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:41,550
Remember, you gave this to me!


898
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,490
I'll never give it back to you!


899
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,990
Good work today.


900
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,690
Thank you, Senior Yoon.


901
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,160
Your advice helped us a lot
with the contest.


902
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:55,970
You flatter me.


903
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,430
You all are so good, I did nothing.


904
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,170
How can you say that?
You gave us lots of tips.


905
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,640
If one of us wins the prize,
we'll treat you big time.


906
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,880
We should treat her even if we don't win.


907
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,250
Then we'll treat you
even if we don't win.


908
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,340
You don't have to.


909
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,720
Just make it to the PT round.


910
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,250
Okay.


911
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,840
You're heading home, right?


912
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,980
How will you go?


913
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,050
I'll take the bus over there.


914
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,150
I brought my car.


915
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,590
Do you want me to drive you home?


916
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,290
It's okay. I'll take the bus.


917
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,330
I'll be going now. Get home safely.


918
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:27,990
Okay.


919
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,900
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.


920
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,470
Get home safely, Senior Yoon!


921
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,970
Let's go. Drop us off on your way home.


922
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:36,810
Okay.


923
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,010
Let's go.


924
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,750
[Chae Hyun-seung]


925
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,780
[Did you get home safely?]


926
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,790
[This is an innocent question
from a junior to a senior.]


927
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,850
[I just arrived.]


928
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,060
[See you tomorrow, Junior Chae.]


929
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,510
[Okay, Senior Yoon.]


930
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,030
Let's go.


931
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,760
Yes, sir.


932
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,470
Here.


933
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,310
Give it to the models
or celebrity friends of yours.


934
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,550
It's a new essence.


935
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,830
If it's good enough,


936
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,610
ask them to upload it
on their social media.


937
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,150
Can they say it's not good
if they don't like it?


938
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,080
Geez.


939
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,780
Whatever.


940
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,880
Where are you going?


941
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,450
To the studio.


942
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,150
I have to wrap up yesterday's shoot.


943
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,560
Are you still busy nowadays?


944
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,520
Not really.


945
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,830
I'm turning down new projects.


946
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,220
I'm going to focus on
my married life after the wedding.


947
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,060
I won't be able to do that if not now.


948
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,330
Are you that happy
to get married to Jae-shin?


949
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,060
Yes.


950
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,700
What a quick and assured answer.


951
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,380
I'll leave now. I've stayed for too long.


952
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,180
Are you not going to see Jae-shin?


953
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,240
No. I don't want to bother him.


954
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,850
I'll see myself out.


955
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,290
Which floor?


956
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,820
-Tenth floor.
-Tenth floor.


957
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,670
Hold the elevator!


958
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,570
Thank you.


959
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,750
Oh, right.


960
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,720
You know, your senior...


961
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,820
-My senior?
-Yes.


962
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,760
She's a really nice person,
just like you said.


963
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,530
She doesn't have a boyfriend, right?


964
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,130
Why do you ask?


965
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,460
Is she interested in a blind date?


966
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,360
I have a friend who'd be perfect for her.


967
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,600
Is Senior Yoon Song-ah 28 years old?


968
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,200
Forget it. She's not interested.


969
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,270
Why?


970
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,970
You said she doesn't have a boyfriend.


971
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,310
My friend is really great.


972
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,210
He has looks, personality,
qualifications and everything.


973
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,210
This is your floor.


974
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,410
I should go.


975
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,220
Tell her about it, okay?


976
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,090
I'll send a photo later. Bye.


977
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,980
Why are you two together?


978
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,540
Let's go, Senior Yoon.
