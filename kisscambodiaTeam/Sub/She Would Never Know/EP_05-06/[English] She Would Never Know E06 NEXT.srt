00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,808
{\an8}ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,160
This is unbelievable.

3
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,170
Hey!

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,440
Seriously!

5
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,280
Your head! Hey!

00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,242
{\an8}EPISODE 6

7
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:21,900
Drink it.

8
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,670
Don't forget this!

9
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,860
{\an8}SEVEN HOURS AGO

10
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,020
Geez, why are you so heavy?

11
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,020
My password is my birthday.

12
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,550
I know. You said that a hundred times.

13
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,170
Is it this one?

14
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,870
I can hear my house crumbling down.

15
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,010
No.

16
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,180
Mind the steps!

17
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,650
Slow down.

18
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,820
Good. Slow down.

19
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,720
You're as big as a bear.

20
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,090
Hyun-seung, let me take your bag off.

21
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,480
-My bag...
-Sit up.

22
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,600
-I don't have my bag.
-Sit up.

23
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,900
Head.

24
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,520
Ow, you pulled out my hair.

25
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,770
Why are you laughing?

26
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,650
Hyun-seung, you know
this is your house, right?

27
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm going home now. Bye.

28
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,020
No.

29
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,620
Why can't I go?

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,690
Let go!

31
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,360
-Let go!
-No, never.

32
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
Stop! You're being bad!

33
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,230
You're the worst.

34
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,600
I'll leave now.

35
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
What do you want me to do?

36
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,080
Let's go.

37
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,720
Huh?

38
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,040
Let's go.

39
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,470
-Let's go!
-Where?

40
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,520
Sit here, please.

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,820
Sit down, please. Okay, thank you.

42
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,260
Okay.

43
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,100
Wait a second.

44
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you going to do?

45
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,760
Here.

46
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,260
These are all yours.

47
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,230
-Huh?
-Eat it all.

48
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,670
Oh! Okay.

49
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,140
It's 100% juice...

50
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,760
Drink it.

51
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,660
I can leave after I finish this, is it?

52
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,330
Finish it. It's good for your health.

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,200
Seriously.

54
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,970
Open your mouth.

55
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,130
You better remember this tomorrow.

56
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,580
Don't forget this!

57
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,060
You eat well.

58
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,830
You're pretty.

59
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,930
Pretty.

60
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,570
What?

61
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,870
What are you going to do now?

62
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,780
I'll get even with you tomorrow.

63
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,750
<i>Starting from tomorrow,
we don't know each other.</i>

64
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
<i>Don't ever talk to me.</i>

65
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,090
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

66
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,230
Yes, bit by bit...

67
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,860
Why did you drink so much?

68
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,400
You're not even a newbie.

69
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,600
It could've been hard to decline

70
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
since it was your first time.

71
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,040
Did they force you to drink?

72
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,730
No, it wasn't like that.

73
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,560
Why did you get drunk then?
That's not like you.

74
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,680
Well...

75
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,850
I wanted to do well.

76
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,920
Do well?

77
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,390
I wanted to fit in and adapt well,
so that you wouldn't worry.

78
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,660
Though I made you worry in the end.

79
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
I taught you wrong.

80
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,900
It's good to fit in,

81
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,670
but you must know how much you can handle.

82
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,730
Also, I never worry about you.

83
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,280
You're already doing well.

84
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,670
Why would I worry about
someone who's doing well?

85
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,690
In fact, you did too well yesterday.

86
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,490
Anyway, don't let this happen again.

87
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,290
Alright.

88
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,450
This is for you.

89
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,830
How do you feel?

90
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,260
I'm fine.

91
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,040
Why were you there last night though?

92
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,940
I was passing by.

93
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,210
The place?

94
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,940
Yes.

95
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,540
Let's go, we have to work.

96
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,710
Passing by?

97
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,780
Yes!

98
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,280
Come quickly!

99
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,620
Okay.

100
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,420
The reason I asked for the two of you

101
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,930
is because the chairman
demanded something.

102
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,250
Do you have data comparing between
the color cosmetics

103
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,000
of global brands and that of our brand?

104
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,460
Something about managing products or SKU?

105
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,440
We do, but it still has some rough edges.

106
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,100
{\an8}SKU (STOCK KEEPING UNIT):
NUMBER OF PRODUCTS BEING MANAGED

107
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,660
How long will it take
if you two work on it together?

108
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,510
I can't be sure.

109
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,480
It's impossible to finish it by today.

110
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,310
Send it to me as soon as possible then.

111
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,180
After we presented the Europe Project,

112
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,980
he's gotten very interested
in color cosmetics.

113
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,220
You may leave now.

114
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,460
Sir, there's something I need to tell you.

115
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,090
What is it?

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,060
In this project, I...

117
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,300
I'll tell him.

118
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,940
I'll tell him about that.

119
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,430
What is it about?

120
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,070
ABM Yoon's mother lives alone.

121
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,830
So?

122
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,240
So it's hard for her to leave for
Europe for several years.

123
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,200
She's the only child.

124
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,140
So she's decided not to go?

125
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,440
Yes.

126
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,580
That can't be helped. What else can we do?

127
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,550
Find an alternative quickly.

128
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,020
Okay.

129
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,010
To meet your deadline,

130
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,680
it'll be really hard
to start from the design.

131
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,420
However, we can modify
what you're wearing...

132
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,660
I'll just go with this one.

133
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,020
Really?

134
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,360
But you have to meet the deadline
no matter what it takes.

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,970
-I'll leave now.
-Good job today.

136
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,580
What time is it?

137
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,410
-Good work. Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

138
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,940
Goodbye.

139
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,280
I sent the report form already.
Fill in and send it back to me.

140
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,670
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,360
If you're feeling uncomfortable,
you don't have to do it here.

142
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,020
It's okay, sir.

143
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,030
Do as you wish.

144
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm stepping outside for a bit.

145
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,550
Do you have a lot of work to do?

146
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,110
Do you need help?

147
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,950
No, it's okay. Go home.

148
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,290
Hey, Chae Hyun-seung!

149
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,590
Can't you show up in a normal way?

150
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,400
No. This is my charm.

151
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,300
Are you off work? Want to grab dinner?

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,570
Dinner?

153
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,300
Up for it?

154
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Is that a yes?

155
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,950
What the...

156
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,600
What the...

157
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,540
I just don't feel like eating alone today.

158
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,880
This is the sandwich you like.

159
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,850
This is the strawberry milk you like.

160
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,520
This is mine.

161
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
What? Do you need something else?

162
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,050
Did I not bring wet wipes?

163
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
I'm okay.

164
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,290
It's just work.

165
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,070
Man.

166
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,870
You know what I'm thinking
even before I tell you.

167
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,960
It's so rewarding, being your boyfriend.

168
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
Just eat already.

169
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,800
Okay.

170
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,740
Seems like you need to write
a lot of reports these days.

171
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,810
Apparently, the company
is preparing a huge project.

172
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,620
So the chairman asked for
a bunch of information.

173
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,780
Oh, even the chairman?

174
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,440
Yes.

175
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,510
Are you on the fast track to success now?

176
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,830
Become an assistant manager
at a young age, and all the way to BM?

177
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,970
Why? Do you want me to guide you?

178
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,900
I'll be so grateful if you do.

179
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,970
I'll trust you and follow you.

180
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,540
I can never beat you.

181
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,040
Thanks for the food.

182
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,340
Enjoy your meal.

183
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,160
How may I help you?

184
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,590
Huh? Son!

185
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,830
Lee Se-dong's son, Mr. Lee Jae-shin?

186
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,700
Yes.

187
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,740
I told you my son works in a huge company.

188
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,310
How could you not believe me?

189
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,280
My son graduated from
the best university in Korea!

190
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,680
What's going on?

191
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,590
Mr. Lee Se-dong is
the victim of an assault.

192
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,360
The assailant is the man next to him.

193
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,590
-Ouch!
-Sheesh.

194
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,660
He can agree to a settlement...

195
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll never agree to a settlement!

196
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,230
Then what?

197
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,320
You want to put him in jail?

198
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,510
You committed attempted fraud against him,

199
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,100
don't you know that?

200
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,570
I was wronged!

201
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,440
He was looking for a way
to earn some money,

202
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
so I recommended him

203
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,280
an investment scheme.

204
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,050
But I didn't know it was a fraud.

205
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,320
I was conned too!

206
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,380
And what's with your attitude?

207
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,310
I'm the sole victim here! Huh?

208
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,730
You swindler!

209
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,690
Seriously.

210
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,960
Sit down!

211
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,500
We'll find out the truth
after investigating his case.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,370
We called you because he said
you can be his guarantor.

213
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,700
Can you do it?

214
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,480
We shouldn't have settled like that.

215
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,670
Why did you agree
to take that little money?

216
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,150
Didn't you go to a top university?

217
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,320
I got hit for nothing.

218
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,460
Hey, let's go somewhere for a bite.

219
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,560
I was in there for hours. I'm so hungry.

220
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,660
Hey! Where are you going?

221
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,010
Give me some money before you go.

222
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,020
I need money.

223
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,710
If I got a better settlement,
that would've solved my problem.

224
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,320
But I didn't because of you,

225
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,380
so you have to give me money.

226
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,820
So? Can you give it to me now?

227
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,340
Or

228
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:19,720
should I pay you a visit to your office?

229
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You still work
at that shiny building, right?

230
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,139
Text me your account number.

231
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,560
I'll treat you to
something good next time.

232
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,300
If you insist.

233
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,090
Take care.

234
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,350
You, too.

235
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,320
Bye.

236
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,920
Jae-woon's sister took some pills

237
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,220
because of me.

238
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,930
After that, Jae-woon asked me
to marry his sister.

239
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,670
It was actually an order.

240
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,870
I had no option to refuse the order.

241
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,570
I had no choice but to marry her.

242
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,640
I can't get out

243
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,210
unless they let me go.

244
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,880
I just have to live like this.

245
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,330
So don't let me ruin

246
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,560
your opportunity to go to Europe.

247
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,220
I won't either.

248
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,130
I'm just an unpleasant eyesore
to you now, right?

249
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,170
Sooner or later, you won't even
care about me anymore.

250
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,640
Don't miss this golden chance
simply because of me.

251
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,650
Just focus on what's good for you.

252
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,280
You've always wanted a chance like this.

253
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,770
So pretty!

254
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,450
You're so pretty, Ha-eun!

255
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,240
It's so pretty.

256
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,610
Do you like it too, Ha-eun?

257
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,500
Your dresses are the prettiest
in the world.

258
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,750
You're even prettier.

259
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,110
Happy birthday, Ha-eun.

260
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,850
Thanks.

261
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,550
Go get changed so that
you can wear it on your birthday.

262
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,350
No, I want to wear this home.

263
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,090
It'll get wrinkled.

264
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,620
You can iron it for me.

265
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,130
Geez.

266
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,670
Can't you make dresses, Mom?

267
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,570
Why? Do you want me to make one for you?

268
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,940
Aunt Ji-seung makes dresses

269
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,080
while Uncle Hyun-seung makes cosmetics.

270
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,080
But you stay at home all the time.

271
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,250
What do you mean?

272
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,350
I'm busy raising you to be a pretty girl.

273
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,430
Do you want me to work?

274
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,100
Like Aunt Ji-seung?

275
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,370
No, you should do whatever you want.

276
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,500
Your favorite thing is raising me.

277
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Of course.

278
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,280
So there's nothing wrong
with the mascara container?

279
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,050
Nothing changed?

280
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,220
<i>The post-process and the thickness</i>

281
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,510
<i>are the same as before.</i>

282
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,810
<i>Shall I make the container thicker?</i>

283
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,660
What about the cost variance then?

284
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,030
<i>There's not much difference.</i>

285
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,100
Then ask the manufacturer to...

286
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,900
Huh?

287
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,100
<i>See you downstairs!</i>

288
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,240
Oh, yes.

289
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,680
Here.

290
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,020
Thanks.

291
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,810
I should be buying.

292
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,990
No, it's okay.

293
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,860
When did you get back to Korea?

294
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,150
It's not the time for you
to return to the office yet.

295
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,660
I still have a few months left.

296
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,460
I dropped in because
I had something to report.

297
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
How have you been?

298
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,470
I hear your work is excellent, as always.

299
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,100
I'm just doing my best.

300
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,540
Don't work too much though.

301
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,580
So that you can work hard when I return.

302
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,150
The BM position in your team
might become vacant.

303
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,720
I have my eye on it.

304
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,920
Oh...

305
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,190
Wait, you know about that?

306
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,230
Are you involved in the Europe Project?

307
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,060
No. They did make an offer,

308
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,000
but I'm not sure.

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,670
Why?

310
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,370
It's such a good opportunity.
You have to take it.

311
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,610
Something is keeping you here?

312
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,140
Family? Boyfriend?

313
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,180
No.

314
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm just wondering
if I'm qualified enough to go.

315
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,470
Oh? It's BM Choi. When did she come back?

316
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,330
Who is she?

317
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,590
She's at the European branch office.

318
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,510
She's a real hotshot.

319
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,850
Hello.

320
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,890
-I'm the one who contacted you.
-Nice to meet you.

321
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Come this way, please.

322
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,630
Hyun-seung.

323
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,530
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,530
Go inside and get more freebies.

325
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,400
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,450
Please open them too.

327
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,040
We should organize it

328
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,770
in order to avoid confusion later.

329
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,410
Okay.

330
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,330
Sir!

331
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,630
We couldn't reach the model.

332
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,240
So the male model couldn't come?

333
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,600
They said he left,

334
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,880
but we couldn't get a hold of him.

335
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,600
There's no substitute, is it?

336
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,500
What did the agency say?

337
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,280
All the A-list models are booked.

338
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,390
Those who are available
aren't suitable for cosmetics.

339
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
What should we do?

340
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,190
We can't do this without a male model.

341
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,960
It's the main part.

342
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,760
I know.

343
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,100
Should I get prepared then?

344
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,560
Don't I look dandy today?

345
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,130
Just say something if I'm not.
It's awkward if you

346
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,100
don't say anything.

347
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,260
Did you invite male beauty influencers?

348
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,970
Yes, there're a few of them.
Should I ask them?

349
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,940
Let's call them first.

350
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,240
Where's the list?

351
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,150
Hyun-seung has it.

352
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,550
Hyun-seung!

353
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,110
Yes?

354
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,220
You have the list, right?

355
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,000
Huh?

356
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,600
Wait!

357
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,060
Wait for a second...

358
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,190
Me?

359
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,660
Hyun-seung, turn around.

360
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,500
Look, he's perfect.

361
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,800
There's no need to find someone else.

362
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,680
He has great complexion and build.

363
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,190
He's practically a model.

364
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,110
Isn't that right, sir?

365
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,430
Is it okay?

366
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,120
We're not forcing you,
so don't feel pressured.

367
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,980
Do whatever you like.

368
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,390
He seems to feel uncomfortable.

369
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,350
Find someone from our clients.

370
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,750
I'll do it.

371
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,930
I'll do it. I'll try it out.

372
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,960
That's a great decision. We're safe now.

373
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,330
Thanks, Hyun-seung.

374
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,330
Let's get you changed.

375
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,400
Help him with it, Song-ah.

376
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,170
Okay. Let's go, Hyun-seung.

377
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,570
Okay.

378
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,550
I'll go inside and get ready.

379
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,860
We should do a final check.

380
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,010
I'll make preparations.

381
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,480
Do the clothes fit well?

382
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Yes, they do.

383
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:37,990
Give that to me.

384
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,060
We don't have much time.
Come here quickly.

385
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,660
Okay.

386
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,630
Wow, you have a great complexion.

387
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,400
It's better than
the beauty product models.

388
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,570
I'm flattered.

389
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,300
I'll style your hair first.

390
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,110
Okay.

391
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
All done.

392
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,450
Thank you.

393
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,490
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

394
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,410
First of all, I'd like to thank
all the VIP clients

395
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,770
who took time out of their busy schedule

396
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,040
to come to the KLAR event.

397
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,370
This event is a beauty class
for our VIP clients.

398
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,640
It will be led by the makeup artist,
Jeon Hyun-hong.

399
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,820
Before we start, let's watch
a short video from KLAR.

400
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,030
{\an8}WELCOME TO KLAR'S VIP BEAUTY CLASS!

401
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,530
Get the artist and
female model ready first.

402
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,600
Already?

403
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,070
Hyun-seung has only
gotten his hair styled.

404
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,730
Song-ah, help him with the skincare then.
You can do it, right?

405
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,740
Yes, I can...

406
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,250
Okay, I'll do it.

407
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,250
Great. Please follow me.

408
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,550
Thank you for doing it.

409
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,120
Ignore my clumsiness, okay?

410
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,960
You'll do fine. Don't worry.

411
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,030
Senior Yoon.

412
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,630
Huh?

413
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,360
Can I ask you something?

414
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,460
What?

415
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,540
Are you going to Europe?

416
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,010
How did you know about that?

417
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,620
No matter what your decision is,
I'll support you.

418
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,530
I really wanted to say that.

419
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,340
They ask for the male model now.

420
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,110
Okay!

421
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,310
Okay.

422
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,670
Hurry up.

423
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,000
{\an8}KLAR'S VIP BEAUTY CLASS INVITATION

424
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,080
Let's jump into the next stage
of KLAR's makeup world.

425
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,280
The model is very handsome, isn't he?

426
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Yes!

427
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,220
Please give him a round of applause
so he'll do well today.

428
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,590
Thank you.

429
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,230
You should brighten up three spots
with the foundation.

430
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,970
First,

431
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,170
the forehead.

432
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,240
Then, the ridge of the nose.

433
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,180
Lastly, the triangle zone.

434
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,980
Keep the amount to a bare minimum.

435
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,550
The shade should be one level
brighter than the skin.

436
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,870
How many levels? Yes, one level.

437
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,860
Go along the texture of the skin.
Do it gently.

438
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,660
Will you face the audience?

439
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,350
Thank goodness, he's doing well.

440
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,840
I can do well too.

441
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,570
Never.

442
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,620
You can just say no. Why say never?

443
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:07,550
It often looks awkward
because of the color difference.

444
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,120
Brighten the front part of the neck
with the same shade

445
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,720
to give it a three-dimensional effect.

446
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,190
<i>No matter what your decision is,
I'll support you.</i>

447
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,220
If you apply it vertically
and horizontally,

448
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,970
it will fix better on the skin.

449
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,370
Now, I'll show you
how to apply lip products.

450
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
Hello.

451
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,410
You can give it to me.

452
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,960
Here.

453
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,560
Please follow me. This way.

454
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,870
I'm sorry.

455
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,150
Excuse me!

456
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,940
We met before, haven't we?

457
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,880
We met at the store the other time.

458
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,750
Don't you remember?

459
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,220
Hello.

460
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,890
I thought you were a store employee.

461
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,690
Turns out you're from HQ.

462
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,220
KLAR Team.

463
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,630
Yoon Song-ah.

464
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,210
I have to go now.

465
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,040
Okay, bye.

466
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,100
Are you going inside?

467
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,420
No, I'm done.

468
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,340
Wow, this is great. How much is it?

469
00:34:52,749 --> 00:34:53,470
3,000 won?

470
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,510
It's cheap and good.

471
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,959
Hi, I'm here.

472
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,180
Welcome.

473
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:06,789
Bracken and bellflower roots.

474
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,830
Okay.

475
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,560
It's for my husband's memorial service,

476
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,880
so give me the best ones.

477
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,720
Okay, you're so fussy.

478
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,300
What about your daughter?

479
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,690
She's on her way.

480
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,710
By the way, shouldn't she get married now?

481
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,660
My nephew works in Seoul too.

482
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,640
Should I set them up?

483
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,050
She's only 28 years old.
She's too young to get married.

484
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,290
Stop talking nonsense
and give me my stuff.

485
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,500
Alright.

486
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,910
Why is everyone interested
in her marriage?

487
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,230
She's my daughter.

488
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,390
Wait a minute, is this girl coming or not?

489
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,550
Sheesh.

490
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,450
Yes.

491
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,660
Have you reached?

492
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,800
Yes.

493
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,410
Don't get into a fight with her.

494
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,520
I know, don't worry.

495
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:10,820
{\an8}WE'RE CLOSED FOR TODAY.

496
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,810
Spend the night there.

497
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,240
Okay, I'll call you.

498
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:15,354
Okay.

499
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,034
{\an8}MY LOVELY DEAR.

500
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,430
Hey, you're home?

501
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,830
Sweetie! Where are you?

502
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,470
Huh?

503
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,970
Sweetie!

504
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,880
When did you get here?

505
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,910
Throw these away.

506
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,150
And Dad's photos too.

507
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,990
Why sleep in the living room
when you have your own room?

508
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,950
You just came home
and you're nagging me already.

509
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,920
Also,

510
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,230
they represent your father.

511
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,990
Why would I throw them away?

512
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,200
They're precious.

513
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,420
All done.

514
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,440
Really?

515
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,190
Let's see.

516
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,720
Great, it's sturdy and good.

517
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,510
The task is done.

518
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,030
Why order self-assembly furniture
when you can't do it?

519
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,700
Why do you think I did?
Because it's cheap.

520
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,900
Didn't you do well
in the finance business?

521
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,870
Where did all that money go?

522
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,330
Where do you think it went?

523
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:47,050
I bought you meals and drinks
when you were in school.

524
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,590
I don't recall you buying me anything.

525
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,440
I did. Think hard.

526
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,660
Okay, I'll think about it on my way home.

527
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,590
Bye.

528
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,890
What?

529
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,270
What are all those?
How can I do that all by myself?

530
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,930
I called someone to help you out.

531
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,600
Who?

532
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,540
Why would you call me

533
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,210
on a weekend?

534
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,780
I hope your dad enjoys the food.

535
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,740
He loved my radish sprouts.

536
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,690
So, how are you doing?

537
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,220
If you hung up like that,
you should've called back.

538
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,920
Don't you wonder
if your mother is dead or alive?

539
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,690
Did something happen last time?

540
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,220
It sounded like you were crying.

541
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,390
Let's hold Dad's memorial
at a temple or somewhere else.

542
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,970
What are you talking about?

543
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,210
It's been 13 years since he left.

544
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,340
You're still young.

545
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,130
You should make a fresh start.

546
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:43,900
Are you telling me to
abandon your father and get married?

547
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,490
Abandon who?

548
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,030
He died a long time ago.

549
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,810
You're one heartless girl.

550
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,810
Your father means so much to me.

551
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,780
How could you tell me to abandon him

552
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,650
and go find another man?

553
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,190
What kind of daughter are you?

554
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,820
Are you, by any chance,

555
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,080
trying to get rid of me
because of your boyfriend?

556
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,500
What kind of person was he?

557
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,540
What?

558
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,580
Was Dad such a great person

559
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,130
for you to be devoted like this?

560
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,380
What are you talking about?

561
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,400
Of course, your dad was a good person.

562
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,500
He behaved socially even without laws.

563
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,220
He loved me so much.
He was good to you too.

564
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,090
I can't believe how ungrateful you are!

565
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,390
Huh? Where are you going?

566
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,510
You haven't finished eating.

567
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:45,910
I finished it.

568
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,610
Seriously, that girl.

569
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,970
Every time...

570
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,810
Thanks for working so hard!

571
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,560
It was worth raising you,
my precious juniors!

572
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,520
So that's why you bought us meals
when we were in school.

573
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,300
It was all for today.

574
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,790
Right? I bought you a lot of meals, right?

575
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,830
But why don't you remember?

576
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,650
You bought meals mainly for girls.

577
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,040
I acknowledge that.

578
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,340
But among the guys,
I treated you the best.

579
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,190
By the way, about the money I spent on
buying you drinks...

580
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,690
You can pay me back
by hanging out with me until I die.

581
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,410
That's too harsh.

582
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,580
I didn't even drink that much.

583
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,660
I'll just pay you back in cash.

584
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,510
Keep it.

585
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,280
Anyway,

586
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,430
accidental death can't be helped.

587
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,620
I'll deal with dying of hunger.

588
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,140
You two are responsible
to prevent me from dying alone.

589
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:26,540
Including me?

590
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,380
It'll bore me if I see
the same person all the time.

591
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,090
You're being picky
under such circumstances?

592
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,860
I'm good at scheming.

593
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,720
You're almost like a loan shark.

594
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,570
Man.

595
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,790
This won't do.

596
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,400
Huh?

597
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,330
I should find a woman for him.

598
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,510
There must be an angel out there

599
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,690
who will take him in.

600
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,940
You don't have any preferences, do you?

601
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,140
Nope. None.

602
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,200
Okay.

603
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,340
That's wise.

604
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,840
Got anyone?

605
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,570
I'm in the lobby.

606
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,350
Okay, I'll wait. Take your time.

607
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,810
Did you, by any chance, come to see me?

608
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
I guess not.

609
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,610
What brings you here?

610
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,590
If it's okay for you,
would you like to have lunch with me?

611
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,980
It's lunchtime.

612
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,340
Sir, you're on your way
to a lunch meeting.

613
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,620
I can cancel it.

614
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,140
It was planned a month ago, so you can't.

615
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,530
I can make the impossible possible.

616
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,610
Yes, I'm quite competent.

617
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,130
I made plans already.

618
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,300
Oh, I guess not today then.

619
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,390
But we'll see each other soon.

620
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,240
You'll soon be able to buy
the lipstick you were looking for.

621
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,030
When you get the word,
you can come anytime you want.

622
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,640
I'll doll up and wait for you.

623
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:46,980
Ji-seung!

624
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:48,700
Hey!

625
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,920
What brings you here?

626
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,550
The pop-up store project.

627
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,170
I've decided to do it.

628
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,060
You did?

629
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,550
You're on a roll!

630
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,690
But I don't know
if I made the right decision.

631
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,760
I don't know if I can
handle a bigger business.

632
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,200
You'll do great. I guarantee it.

633
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,300
You've gotten thin.

634
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,020
Something happened?

635
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,030
Me?

636
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,610
I'm fine.

637
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,080
For real. Nothing happened.

638
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,400
Do you want me to set you up
on blind dates?

639
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,590
It's better for you to go.

640
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,810
How's it going with the blind date
Yeon-seung mentioned before?

641
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,000
I don't know.

642
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,230
By the way...

643
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,790
What?

644
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,900
Is it easy to reproduce
a discontinued makeup product?

645
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,220
For example, lipstick.

646
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,280
Of course not.

647
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,900
We have to revive a dead product line.

648
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,820
The process is complicated,

649
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,690
and it doesn't always succeed.

650
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,650
It's harder than increasing
the production volume.

651
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,510
Why do you ask?

652
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,220
Huh?

653
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,650
No reason. Have your lunch.

654
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,310
Okay, I'll be right there.

655
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,520
Manager Yoo.

656
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,930
She went to the training team.

657
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,640
ABM Yoon, come with me to the store.

658
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,040
It's urgent, so get ready immediately.

659
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,960
Yes, sir.

660
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,410
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, sir.

661
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,840
Hello, sir.

662
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,850
Are you an employee?

663
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,390
Yes, I'm ABM Yoon Song-ah from KLAR.

664
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,950
I thought you'd be curious
about the products.

665
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,580
She knows everything
about color cosmetics.

666
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,890
Is that so? Nice to meet you.

667
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,220
This snack tastes better
when I eat it like this.

668
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,400
You already ate a lot at lunch.

669
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,460
The cafeteria lunch wasn't enough for me.

670
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,970
Manager Ahn? Hey!

671
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,870
What's on your mind?

672
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,950
Why is BM Lee taking Song-ah everywhere?

673
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,090
Is there something going on?

674
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,810
Senior Yoon left with BM Lee?

675
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:27,500
Yes.

676
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,090
They hurriedly went to the store.

677
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,370
It's not good to be
called to urgent matters.

678
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,410
Still,

679
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:40,230
there must be something going on.

680
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,960
You must be really exhausted
with all the wild thoughts.

681
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,360
You make me more exhausted.

682
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,550
Yes, hello?
This is Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

683
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,480
I'm Chief Kim.

684
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,470
Oh, yes. Hello.

685
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,880
Hi, is ABM Yoon Song-ah not in?

686
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,410
She's on outside duty right now.
You can talk to me.

687
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,490
What?

688
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,010
We took special care
in displaying the products.

689
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,940
As you can see,
the eyeliners are over here.

690
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,850
The front part here is the skincare line.

691
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,830
The lipsticks I told you about
are our main items,

692
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,290
so we placed it close to the entrance.

693
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,200
Would you like to see it?

694
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
Darn it!

695
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,530
I saw you take it.

696
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,260
You saw it wrong.

697
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,330
Go check on them.

698
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,600
Show me what's in your pocket.

699
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,010
Why should I?

700
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,530
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

701
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,550
Call then!

702
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,230
What's going on?

703
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,290
This girl stole a product,
but she insists she didn't.

704
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,700
I didn't steal it!

705
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,090
Let me see what's in your pocket then.

706
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,570
Why should I show it to you?

707
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,650
You should prove me wrong.

708
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,100
Are you sure she stole it?

709
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,590
Yes, she definitely stole it.

710
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,350
There are surveillance cameras, right?

711
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,360
Yes.

712
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,060
But it's a blind spot,
so it might not be on the camera.

713
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,270
I should call the police.

714
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,020
Just send them away.

715
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,380
This isn't important right now.

716
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,030
Just send them away?

717
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,390
What's the problem?

718
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,890
What's going on?

719
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,290
This student stole a product, sir.

720
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,890
I told you I didn't!

721
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,220
You're confident
you didn't steal it, right?

722
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,840
Right! I didn't steal!

723
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,210
How many times do I have to say it?

724
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,430
You tell me.

725
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,060
She said she didn't steal it!

726
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,730
Not that. Tell me what you know.

727
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,470
She didn't steal.

728
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,840
Is that so?

729
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,690
You're at the age
where you want these things.

730
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,810
Fill a basket with all kinds of products.

731
00:51:59,090 --> 00:51:59,940
Yes, sir.

732
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,810
I want to make a deal with you.

733
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,400
If you tell the truth,

734
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,860
I'll give you everything in that basket.

735
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,160
You'll really give me all of it?

736
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,670
Hey!

737
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,660
Of course.

738
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,920
Fill another basket.

739
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,790
Yes, sir.

740
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,800
Well...

741
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,330
Darn it! Seriously! Here!

742
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,870
I was just going to test it.

743
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,870
Let her go.

744
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,140
I can take these, right?

745
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,580
You said I can take them
if I tell the truth.

746
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,360
What have you done?

747
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:22,220
You got this back because of me.

748
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,580
Did you say your friend stole it?

749
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,120
You lost your chance while hesitating

750
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,540
for your shallow friendship.

751
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,110
If you ask for something
when you did nothing,

752
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,250
you become a thief too.

753
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,430
Don't you agree?

754
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,800
What a jerk!

755
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,010
Young ones and old ones alike...

756
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,620
They say they're friends and all,

757
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,560
but when there's profit involved,

758
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,420
they stab you in the back.

759
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:59,560
That's why you shouldn't
let strangers in your house.

760
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,400
Things that need to
stay outside must stay outside.

761
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,510
Let's go.

762
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:35,170
So the package was misprinted
for the re-produced lipstick?

763
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,790
Yes, the previous one
was for limited edition,

764
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:39,980
so Senior Yoon sent them a new one.

765
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,870
But they printed the previous one.

766
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,350
I'm sorry, I must've been out of my mind.

767
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:48,090
The event will take place
two days later, isn't it?

768
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,000
Director Lee is paying
extra attention to it.

769
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,550
Can we ship it tomorrow
if we print a new one now?

770
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,450
They said it's possible
tomorrow afternoon.

771
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,010
It can't be shipped tomorrow then.

772
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,480
Well,

773
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,280
let's report to BM Lee first.

774
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,030
Oh, stickers!

775
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,540
That's what Senior Yoon did
when they misprinted the leaflet.

776
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,080
Can't we do that this time?

777
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,000
I don't see why not.

778
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,330
We can take care of
the urgent ones that way.

779
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,780
You can make stickers quickly, right?

780
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,750
Yes, I'll tell them to make it quickly.

781
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,470
Attaching them is the problem.
Will the factory do it?

782
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,900
It's hard to get part-timers
on short notice,

783
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,650
and I can't go either.

784
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,780
I'll go then.
We need to send the stickers anyway.

785
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,630
Is that okay, Manager Kang?

786
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,020
Go if you want to suffer.

787
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,700
Why would you say that?

788
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,620
Proceed with the stickers first.

789
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:39,610
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'll ask the factory to get part-timers.

790
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,580
Let's see if you'll
need to go, Hyun-seung.

791
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,140
I'll report to BM Lee.

792
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,230
Okay.

793
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,050
Go on ahead.

794
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,750
Why would you put up with that?

795
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,650
You said they wouldn't let you go.

796
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,590
Then why are you being treated that way?

797
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,390
What's wrong with it?

798
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,730
In return, I can live like
a decent human being elsewhere.

799
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,830
I have to pay back my debt.

800
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,120
I think you've paid back plenty
for what you've been doing.

801
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,180
If that's not it...

802
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,310
Do you want to
keep your position that much?

803
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:40,780
Yes.

804
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,550
If I put up with being humiliated
by a few people,

805
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,610
no one will think I'm that criminal's son.

806
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,010
Is it because of your father...

807
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,720
I'm going to persevere.

808
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,050
No matter what.

809
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,600
That's why I need you.

810
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,420
You haven't changed a bit after two years.

811
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,330
You still live like the teenager
who had nothing.

812
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,700
I taped cushions on the stools
for your comfort.

813
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,000
Thank you.

814
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,190
I tried to get more part-timers,

815
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:56,980
but only the two of them are available.

816
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,740
And they only work until nine o'clock.

817
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,520
-Nine o'clock?
-Yes.

818
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,150
Thank you for doing this.

819
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,820
Sure.

820
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,640
The stickers?

821
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,170
Here, they are here.

822
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,610
Okay. Good luck.

823
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:11,220
Thanks.

824
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,440
Goodbye.

825
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,310
Bye.

826
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,190
Wow, when will you finish all of that?

827
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,160
Seems like you need to
pull an all-nighter.

828
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,430
-Goodbye!
-Bye.

829
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,710
Okay, then. Let's begin.

830
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,620
-Okay.
-Okay.

831
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,510
I'm already sick of this.

832
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,240
When will we finish everything?

833
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,060
You'll buy us coffee, right?

834
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,090
Coffee? Oh, okay.

835
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,700
Oh, I made a mistake.

836
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,380
Luckily the stools are cushy.

837
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,050
Right.

838
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,560
<i>So Hyun-seung is at the factory now?</i>

839
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:15,590
Yes.

840
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,460
They hired part-timers,
but there are not enough people.

841
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,430
So we sent him.

842
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,900
He stepped up for his ex-trainer's job.

843
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,770
You raised him well.

844
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,710
I should've raised my trainee well too.

845
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:27,600
Right, Manager Ahn?

846
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:30,810
Major fail.

847
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:39,220
Oh, no. I don't know what to say.

848
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,450
We have to go now.

849
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,960
Oh, I'm sorry. Feel free to leave.

850
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,660
But will you be able to do this all alone?

851
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,560
Even if you're up all night,
I don't think you'll finish.

852
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,500
I can do it. I'll have to try.

853
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,040
He's so optimistic.

854
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,340
Take it easy.

855
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,640
-Okay.
-Let's go.

856
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,090
Get home safely.

857
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,230
You're so handsome.

858
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,110
I feel bad.

859
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,780
I can do this!

860
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,630
Senior Yoon.

861
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,100
Are you still attaching stickers?

862
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,400
Yes.

863
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,010
How many do you have left?

864
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,780
Well...

865
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,750
I'm almost done.
I'll finish in an hour or two.

866
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,550
That's good.

867
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,140
I heard the stickers were your idea.

868
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,920
Good work.

869
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,530
It's all thanks to you.

870
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,460
Since I have to do well
without you after this.

871
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,530
Huh?

872
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,070
Without me?

873
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,270
Yes. Without you.

874
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,980
But I'm staying though.

875
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,280
What?

876
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,820
I'm not going.

877
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,690
I'm not going to Europe.

878
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:34,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

879
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,970
Really?

880
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,210
You can do that?

881
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,080
Why can't I do that?

882
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,720
Hello?

883
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,350
Oh, uh...

884
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,090
I'm sorry. Please wait.

885
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,100
I'll call you back in a second.

886
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:11,430
What?

887
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,770
Yes!

888
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,130
Calm down.

889
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,070
Calm down, Chae Hyun-seung.

890
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,400
I said calm down.

891
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,310
Thank you!

892
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,440
Yes, the water in Europe tastes bad.

893
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,420
She's not going!

894
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Black hair.

895
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,860
Her height is...

896
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,810
European song.

897
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:02,550
What the...

898
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,620
What in the world!

899
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:12,860
Senior Yoon?

900
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,130
You dance really well.

901
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,100
What is this?

902
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:28,740
You said you'll finish in an hour or two.

903
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,180
Where should I start?

904
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:42,490
One glass, please.

905
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:43,820
Okay.

906
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,660
<i>You haven't changed a bit
after two years.</i>

907
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,920
<i>You still live like the teenager...</i>

908
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,930
You scumbag!

909
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,860
<i>Who had nothing.</i>

910
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:58,900
Son!

911
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,120
What do I have then?

912
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,300
Senior Yoon.

913
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:32,400
Huh?

914
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:35,310
Can I ask why you decided
not to go to Europe?

915
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,610
Because it's not what I want to do.

916
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,910
I like what I'm doing now.

917
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:51,720
Also,

918
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:56,130
Korean food suits my taste better.

919
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:44,095
{\an8}SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

920
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:46,570
<i>That's our BM Lee, right?</i>

921
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,897
<i>-I think so.
-He's the only BM who is still unmarried.</i>

922
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:53,400
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

923
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,030
<i>Congratulations!</i>

924
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:57,945
<i>Are you okay?</i>

925
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,883
<i>What do you like about me?</i>

926
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,670
<i>Because I'm very ambitious.</i>

927
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:12,324
<i>Let's go. I'll maintain the distance
if that's what you wish.</i>

928
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,804
<i>-Stop laughing.
-Just like now.</i>
