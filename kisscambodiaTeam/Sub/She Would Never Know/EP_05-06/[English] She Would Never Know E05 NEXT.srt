{\an8}ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,330
Senior Yoon!

3
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,650
Are you alright?

4
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,520
What's wrong?

5
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,020
It's too cramped.

6
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,590
What about you?
Are you here with your friends?

7
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,890
No, I followed you here.

8
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,360
How did you know I'm here?

9
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,490
I saw you while I was passing by.
You stood out.

10
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,129
Great eyesight.

11
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,370
You can go now. I'm here with my friend.

12
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,210
Why? Since we've met, let's hang out.

13
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,910
Hey.

14
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,410
Do you need to leave now?

15
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,440
No.

16
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,250
Let's hang out then!

17
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,350
Great!

18
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,850
Let's go!

19
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,620
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

20
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,250
Come on.

21
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,850
So you two have been friends
since middle school?

22
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,870
{\an8}EPISODE 5

23
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,629
Yes. And we live together too.

24
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,370
It'll bring us trouble
if people find out that

25
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,400
the HQ employee and
store employee are friends,

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,530
so I told her not to tell anyone.

27
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,140
I swear upon my life I won't tell anyone.

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,910
You're overreacting.

29
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,280
Then upon all my assets?

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
By the way, why are you here?

31
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,250
If you have any plans, you can go now.
It's okay.

32
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,379
Plans? Oh, my friends?

33
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,190
They are already gone.

34
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,790
I was on my way home
before I followed you inside.

35
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,930
Why?

36
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,840
I know, right?

37
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,760
I would like to know why.

38
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,100
Were you worried if she might meet a guy?

39
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,900
Hey, Kim Ga-young!

40
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,550
Yes.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,500
You!

42
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,340
No, I mean, she
causes trouble quite often.

43
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,140
When I'm not around, she wreaks havoc.

44
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,379
I followed her inside
because I was worried.

45
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,780
I was worried that she
might cause trouble again.

46
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm your senior.

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,500
I know.

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,760
If you were my junior,
I'd knuckle you on the head.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,530
She gives me so much headache.

50
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,460
So this is who you are.

51
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,900
You're better than I thought.

52
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,710
If you get to know me more,

53
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,330
you'll find me even better.

54
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,910
Should we get to know
each other more tonight then?

55
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,060
Sounds good.

56
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,670
Cheers.

57
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,740
Cheers?

58
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,710
Unbelievable.

59
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,540
We need to get to know each other more.

60
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,320
What a party pooper.

61
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,060
Why don't you two go drink some more?

62
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,190
Shall we?

63
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,930
I'll have to take a rain check.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
I can't fall out of favor
with Senior Yoon.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
Seriously.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Let's meet up early next time.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,470
We should start drinking
in the morning. Up for it?

68
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,270
Sure!

69
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,959
Awesome!

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,570
Stop talking and get in.

71
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,440
Alright. Call us!

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Okay, bye.

73
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,480
Get home safely.

74
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:03,250
Okay.

75
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,050
Senior Yoon.

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,150
Have a great weekend.

77
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:11,990
You, too.

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,160
Get home safely.

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,830
Bye.

80
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,600
Alright!

81
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,230
Fight on!

82
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,030
Ji-Seung, you're watching this, right?

83
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,030
Go easy.

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,840
Alright!

85
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,240
Wait!

86
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,890
Seriously.

87
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,930
Is it good?

88
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,030
The shrimp is good.

89
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,060
Try the sweet and sour pork.

90
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,300
Thank you.

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,030
Hey.

92
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,870
You're seeing someone, right?

93
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,430
You're being too giddy.

94
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,370
You're seeing someone, right?

95
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,080
Of course, I am.

96
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,780
It'd be weird if I'm not.

97
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,150
Who is she? What's she like?

98
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,180
Why do you think it's a woman?

99
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,990
It's a man?

100
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,590
Seriously!

101
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,390
What about you?

102
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,950
What about me?

103
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,900
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

104
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,870
Of course, you aren't.

105
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,370
You never know.

106
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,810
Remember the chef
of the restaurant we went to?

107
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,730
My hubby's friend?

108
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,010
Yes, what about him?

109
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,550
Do you want to set her up with him?

110
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,110
Huh?

111
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,120
Just one date. He seems perfect for you.

112
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,380
I'm not interested!

113
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,590
That's why you need to see him.

114
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,290
If I wait for you to get interested,

115
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,020
I'll never see you get married.

116
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,460
You need to make an effort.

117
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,130
That's the only way
to improve this situation.

118
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,160
Why do you keep running away?

119
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,510
I'm not running away...

120
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,300
Then what? Huh?

121
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,170
Why do you keep your distance
from everyone?

122
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,480
Since we're on the subject,
I'll ask you upfront.

123
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,850
Is the canceled engagement
still troubling you?

124
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,580
Yeon-seung.

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,510
It was your choice.

126
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,450
You weren't dumped, you quit.

127
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,990
So why are you afraid?

128
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,650
Do you regret it after all these years?

129
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,950
I don't regret it.

130
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,060
I'd do the same if I went back in time.

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,350
Then what's the reason?

132
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,690
You're breaking my heart.

133
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,110
You should love, and be loved by someone.

134
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,160
That's the way to live.

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,510
Yeon-seung, stop it.

136
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,340
The noodles are getting cold.

137
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,810
So this time, do as I say.

138
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,510
If you don't like him,
I won't bring it up again.

139
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Okay.

140
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,150
People might think
you're the older sister.

141
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,360
Show me some respect then.

142
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,460
Alright, Big Sister.

143
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,870
Here's your receipt.

144
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,270
Do you, by any chance, have a dog in here?

145
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,940
Sorry?

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,780
I keep hearing the sound
of a dog whimpering.

147
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,010
Is she sick?

148
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,750
She's not well for sure.

149
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,600
Stop that and call her.

150
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
This has gone too long.

151
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Do you think I don't want to call?

152
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,030
I'm scared.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,450
What if she says she'll
never see me again?

154
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,540
She's so heartless.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,390
She hung up the phone.

156
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,240
It'd be nice for her to call me first.

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,550
I told her to go to the college here,

158
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,440
but she abandoned me and went to Seoul.

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Can I ask you something?

160
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,720
Sure.

161
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,530
Are you really her biological mother?

162
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:38,990
Huh?

163
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,550
You're breaking my prejudice

164
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,390
that all the mothers would sacrifice
themselves for the children.

165
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
In your case,
your daughter sacrificed herself.

166
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,960
How can a real mother

167
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,300
not let the child date or go to college?

168
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,640
I feel so sorry for her.

169
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,900
You...

170
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,580
Customers are waiting. Go make beverages.

171
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Go work!

172
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,140
Okay, I will.

173
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,850
So stop pouting and tend the counter.

174
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,890
If you keep loafing around,
I'm going to quit.

175
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,730
Sheesh.

176
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,390
Boo!

177
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,480
Yikes!

178
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,890
Seriously!

179
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,940
Good morning.

180
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,400
Good morning.

181
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,070
Did you rest well yesterday?

182
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,440
Yes, and you?

183
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,740
Me too.

184
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,910
By the way, do you go to clubs often?

185
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,240
You danced really well.

186
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,420
What were your moves?

187
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,880
When did I dance like that?

188
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,920
Or is it like this?

189
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,990
I danced way better than that.

190
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,560
Way better than this?

191
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,480
Show me then.

192
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,760
How dare you!

193
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,320
You must be crazy.

194
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,110
BM Lee, you must be slacking off.

195
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,580
How can you come in
later than the director?

196
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,620
Are you wearing makeup?

197
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,220
Oh, uh...

198
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,360
We're launching a new product.

199
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,720
You're so thorough, as always.

200
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,100
How was the wedding shoot? Exhausting?

201
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,570
I guess.

202
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,240
It's not far off now.

203
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,040
Let's talk about your promotion soon.

204
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,410
Become a director before the wedding

205
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,210
and go to Europe after that.

206
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,550
It's perfect, right?

207
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,820
Stop what? Me?

208
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,260
Stop goofing around.

209
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,820
I didn't.

210
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,500
Get in, Senior Yoon.

211
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,880
Right,

212
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,020
the lipstick is coming out
next week, is it?

213
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,520
ABM Yoon.

214
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,500
Yes, the shipment will be on Thursday.

215
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,630
I'll keep checking.

216
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,350
So you're in charge of it.

217
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,690
You'll send LMS, right?

218
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,250
{\an8}LMS (LONG MESSAGE SERVICE):
GROUP MESSAGING SERVICE FOR LONG TEXTS

219
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,360
To the customers who already bought it.

220
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Please pay extra attention.

221
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,760
It's very important to me.

222
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,770
Of course, sir.

223
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,660
Wait, I should give more than
lip service to you.

224
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,800
What do you think about lunch?

225
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,340
You are free, right?

226
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,500
Yes.

227
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,660
Will you be okay?

228
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,390
There's no reason not to be. I'll be fine.

229
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,650
If that customer comes,
please let me know.

230
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,850
Please call me. This is really good.

231
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,590
Japanese food is okay, right?

232
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,810
Perhaps I should've asked.

233
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,610
Yes, it's alright.

234
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,600
How long have you been working here?

235
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,440
Is it your third year?

236
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,150
Yes.

237
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,450
How's the marketing business? Is it fun?

238
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,250
I'm enjoying it.

239
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,720
I've been looking forward
to dining with you.

240
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,230
BM Lee complimented you once in a while.

241
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,720
He doesn't usually do that.

242
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,200
That's why I've been
keeping an eye on you.

243
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,880
I think you're great.

244
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,010
You're diligent and tactful.

245
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,810
Thank you.

246
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,650
Are there any difficulties at work?

247
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,420
For example, something like
wanting another BM?

248
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,880
What? Are you saying yes to that?

249
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,710
You should step up your game.

250
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,250
Your competent team member might run away.

251
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,400
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,610
Come in.

253
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,570
Your meal is ready.

254
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,750
Chef Oh is here, right?

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm here with important guests,

256
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,300
so pay extra attention.

257
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,640
I wonder what Song-ah's eating.

258
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,880
It'll be really expensive and good, right?

259
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,380
Of course.

260
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,180
I hope I can sit with the director too.

261
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,450
-Manager Ahn.
-Yes?

262
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,390
Should I give you some money?

263
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,160
Really?

264
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,910
Of course. You think I'm lying?

265
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,310
I'm opening my wallet.

266
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,150
Am I being too generous?

267
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,440
Here, buy and eat anything you want.

268
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
You want a designer bag, right?

269
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,110
Buy that too.

270
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,160
And bring me back the change.

271
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,270
Why do you still have so much left?

272
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,460
No appetite?

273
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,220
Oh, right. I guess I don't.

274
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,950
Why? At your age,
even a stone tastes good.

275
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,060
Is it because of your crush?

276
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,690
Oh, no. Not at all.

277
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,950
Who is your crush anyway?

278
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,910
Just tell me. I won't tell anyone.

279
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,970
I was so curious that I couldn't sleep.

280
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,700
Look. Can you see the bags under my eyes?

281
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,440
Manger Ahn, you've always
had bags under your eyes.

282
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,010
At first, I thought you were a panda.

283
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,610
Hyun-seung.

284
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,770
Yes?

285
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,020
If you tell Ahn,
the whole company will know.

286
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,190
Just tell me.

287
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,720
You know I'm good with secrets, right?

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,909
I rarely speak.

289
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,980
I told you. It's Manager Yoo.

290
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,830
Seriously!

291
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:36,070
Don't say that.
She might really think you like her.

292
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,030
He learned bad stuff at the office.

293
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,200
Song-ah should have taught him better.

294
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,970
Hyun-seung!

295
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,010
Hello.

296
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,050
Huh?

297
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,980
Are you having lunch?

298
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,780
Yes.

299
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,720
-You too?
-Yes.

300
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,850
Have you had lunch?

301
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,540
-Yes.
-I see.

302
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,120
You're with them?

303
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,920
Yes.

304
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,490
I see.

305
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,970
You know about the Europe Project, right?

306
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,000
The Europe Project?

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,870
Huh?

308
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,390
You haven't told her yet?

309
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,810
I think it's too soon to make it public.

310
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,910
Geez, you're too cautious.

311
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,310
I can tell her now, right?

312
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,650
She'll be going with you anyway.

313
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,220
Are you interested in working overseas?

314
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,050
Yes, I guess...

315
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,250
We'll begin a major push
into the European market.

316
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,830
We'll open independent stores
starting with Paris.

317
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,060
So we need to set up a TF team.

318
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,600
I hope you'll join the team.

319
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,170
Me?

320
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,200
We need competent people more than ever.

321
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,440
-If you agree, then...
-Director.

322
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,210
I'll discuss it with ABM Yoon later.

323
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
It hasn't been made public yet.

324
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,580
I don't think it's fair to others.

325
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,760
I guess you're more cautious

326
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,720
because she's your team member.

327
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,430
People might think you're favoring her.

328
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,790
BM Lee is in charge of the project.

329
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,170
You can learn the details
from BM Lee later.

330
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,430
That'll do, right, BM Lee?

331
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,600
Yes, sir.

332
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,200
Excuse me.

333
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,040
{\an8}KIM GA-YOUNG: KNOCK KNOCK

334
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,680
<i>Sir, she's here!</i>

335
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,240
{\an8}WINK

336
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,310
Now?

337
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,080
I'm sorry, but I need to go now.
It's urgent.

338
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,120
You two finish up.

339
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,320
Think about it, ABM Yoon.

340
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,520
Sorry.

341
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,170
You were planning to take me to Europe?

342
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,740
It's a good opportunity.

343
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,310
It'll be a great asset to you.

344
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,950
So you really were going to take me.

345
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,980
You never planned to tell me about
your marriage, is it?

346
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,490
If I never found out,

347
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,790
you would've taken me to Europe.

348
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,730
How could you?

349
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,190
Are you really the same person I know?

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,340
How much worse are you going to get?

351
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,710
How much lower can you go?

352
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,590
I'm not that stupid
to fall for the garbage

353
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,490
that is disguised as a good opportunity.

354
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,690
Tell the director that I'm not going.

355
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,930
What happened to you last weekend?

356
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,230
You just left.

357
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,560
Was it because of the call
you were waiting for?

358
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,330
Something important came up.

359
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,170
Is that so? Still, you should've told us.

360
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,040
You didn't even pick up your phone.

361
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,210
Actually, I have something to tell you.

362
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,420
What is it?

363
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,240
Not long ago,

364
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,420
I saw Seo-yeon on my way home from work.

365
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,020
It seems like she works
somewhere around here.

366
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,710
She must've found a job too.

367
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,560
Are you okay?

368
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,760
About Seo-yeon?

369
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
Of course, I am.

370
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,730
I don't even remember her number.

371
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,980
Really?

372
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,860
Since you turned every girl down,

373
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,970
I thought you were still into her.

374
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,180
Then, by any chance, this weekend...

375
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,680
Sorry,

376
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,710
something important came up.

377
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,420
Thanks.

378
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,240
Senior Yoon!

379
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,190
Did you enjoy your lunch?

380
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,870
I guess.

381
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,760
Are you back from lunch?

382
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,660
Yes, I am.

383
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,230
Go ahead to the office.
I'm going to take a walk.

384
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,270
Can I walk with you?

385
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,770
I ate too fast. I feel bloated.

386
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,540
Okay then.

387
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,920
Do you have something important
to do in the afternoon?

388
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,690
No, not really.

389
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
Good.

390
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,050
Huh?

391
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,600
<i>Right.</i>

392
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,500
Hara is already well known,

393
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,760
but if you open a pop-up store

394
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
in our department store,

395
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,200
it will help to further promote your shop.

396
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,150
And thanks to Hara, it'll improve
the image of our store too.

397
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,090
Okay, I'll think about it
in a positive light.

398
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,960
We're planning to make some changes too.

399
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,820
I look forward to your response.

400
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,590
See you again.

401
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,640
Goodbye.

402
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,260
Bye.

403
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,430
We meet again.

404
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,670
You must be wondering why I'm here.

405
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,280
Who are you?

406
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,850
No way.

407
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,310
You don't remember me?

408
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,880
I'm not that easily forgettable.

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,760
Lipstick.

410
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,700
I'll get it for you.

411
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,060
Even if I have to make it myself.

412
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,360
You remember me, right?

413
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,930
What brings you here?

414
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Oh, that.

415
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,140
There's something I want to ask you.

416
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,890
Which is...

417
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,270
Do you need to go through a lawsuit?

418
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,020
For me to meet you?

419
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
For example,

420
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,760
a divorce suit

421
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
or something like that?

422
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,170
<i>Is she saying no?</i>

423
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,260
<i>She's saying no, right?</i>

424
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,300
Do you need it or not?

425
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,530
No.

426
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,000
There's no need for a divorce suit.

427
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,570
Yes!

428
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,810
Okay!

429
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,330
That's great.

430
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,380
As I promised, I'll let you go now.

431
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,480
We'll meet again, so don't be sad.

432
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,650
I'll rack my brains
to find ways to see you.

433
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,160
Bye.

434
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
I broke off my engagement.

435
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,700
If that's an issue...

436
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,310
Should I break off an engagement too?

437
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,290
Tell me your answer next time.

438
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,550
And also your name.

439
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,040
You said you want to bunk off.

440
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,830
That's why we're here.

441
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,950
There's nothing else to do,

442
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,020
so why don't we look at the products?

443
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,180
What are you talking about?

444
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,410
We can eat something nice, watch a movie

445
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,720
or just take a walk.

446
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,520
It's not a date.

447
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,120
I asked you to bunk off.

448
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,690
But still...

449
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,360
We need to develop a new product.

450
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,160
We have to do this soon anyway,

451
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,660
so let's do it now.

452
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
It's a lip tint, right?

453
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,740
Do you like your work that much?

454
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,270
When people don't want to work,

455
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,540
they don't even go near it.

456
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,900
Yes,

457
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,350
I like my work that much.

458
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm going to do it for a very long time.

459
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,430
So I just need to work hard

460
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,660
to win your favor, right?

461
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,630
Teach me quickly,

462
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,160
so that I can develop a good product
and win your favor.

463
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,230
Please explain to me.

464
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,830
Hurry up.

465
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,270
The shape of an applicator
is important in lip products.

466
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,180
We make the shape based on the texture.

467
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,310
It's a bit bent. Like this.

468
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,180
It goes on well.

469
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,740
Right?

470
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,950
The color is really deep.

471
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
What's the color?

472
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,720
You know the colors by number, right?

473
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,090
No. 1 is pink, no. 2 is

474
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,830
orange, no. 3 is beige, no. 4 is red

475
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,950
and no. 5 is purple.

476
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,000
You can name them whatever you like.

477
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,860
But just to be sure,

478
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,670
you need to check
with the legal team first.

479
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,270
Another company might have patented it.

480
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,960
When I come up with a new name,

481
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,140
I should patent it too.

482
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,470
That's right.

483
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:45,980
What could they be?

484
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,210
For example, avoid names like these.

485
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,250
Oh, because they are already taken.

486
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,920
Come in!

487
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Take a seat.

488
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,460
Sorry about earlier.
It was really important.

489
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
Was the lunch good?

490
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,830
Yes.

491
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,740
About the TF team...

492
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,060
You should've told me
before you spoke about it.

493
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,870
I thought you already told her.

494
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,010
We decided to take
ABM Yoon a long time ago.

495
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,310
I don't think I said anything
I shouldn't have.

496
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,180
I think I should sleep on it.

497
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,950
Why all of a sudden?

498
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,320
Is there a problem with her?

499
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,030
It's hard to find someone like her.

500
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,150
Does she have a problem with you?

501
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,270
No,

502
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,800
I just want to be careful.

503
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,670
You should be,

504
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,410
but this is unexpected.

505
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,610
Okay, I know you'll do the right thing.

506
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,540
Let me know when you make a decision.

507
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,880
I'm changing the job assignments.

508
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,460
Manager Kang.

509
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,630
Yes, sir.

510
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,570
You'll be the new trainer for ABM Chae.

511
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,520
He'll be working closely with you

512
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,940
for products and channels.

513
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,170
Why so suddenly?

514
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,180
I've been watching him closely

515
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,030
and I think he's having
a hard time with his task.

516
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,810
Color cosmetics development
is harder than skincare.

517
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,490
I think it was too much
for a first-year newbie.

518
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,380
Teach him well, Manager Kang.

519
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,480
Yes, sir.

520
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,460
Who will come to color cosmetics then?

521
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,360
And who will handle his channels?

522
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,700
I'll let you know after I think about it.

523
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,670
Manager Yoo and ABM Yoon
will have to work on it for now.

524
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,240
Yes, sir.

525
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,180
Just transfer ABM Chae
when you have the decision then.

526
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,840
We can't afford to spare anyone
in our section right now.

527
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,250
We don't know how long it'll take
for you to make the decision.

528
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,140
We can just swap the members when there's

529
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,190
someone available for our section,
so that there's no gap.

530
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,160
Was ABM Chae doing that much work for you

531
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,630
to worry about a gap in the workload?

532
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,460
As I see it, he's more like an assistant.

533
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,400
He does quite a lot for a newbie.

534
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,800
He's doing great.

535
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,470
ABM Yoon,

536
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,270
I understand what you're saying.

537
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,110
But this is my decision as a BM
to operate the team better.

538
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,520
I think it'll be better for his career

539
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,920
to learn the basic knowledge.

540
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,850
I'll decide quickly
so that there won't be a gap.

541
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,630
Start the takeover immediately.

542
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,340
ABM Chae, learn from
Manager Kang after this.

543
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,040
Yes, sir.

544
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,020
Senior Yoon...

545
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,620
Song-ah!

546
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,290
Is there a lot to hand over?

547
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,660
No, not much. Why?

548
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,360
Can it be done
before we get off work?

549
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,340
You can just give me the material.

550
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,260
I'll have to check first.

551
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,360
Okay.

552
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,840
Why?

553
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,040
What were you going to say?

554
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,240
We'll talk later.
Do what you have to do first.

555
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,090
Okay.

556
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,160
<i>Canceled?</i>

557
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,150
I didn't cancel it.

558
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,930
Why did you cancel my dress?

559
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,370
It was because of internal affairs.

560
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,240
I'm getting married in a month.

561
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,340
What is the internal affair?

563
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,570
Are you closing the shop?

564
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,910
We will compensate...

565
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,010
What else do I need other than a dress?

566
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,620
Are you really telling me I'm on my own?

567
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,080
Is this how you handle things?

568
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,690
I don't believe it!

569
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,170
Find a new dress shop for me.

570
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,430
Where they can meet the deadline.

571
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,940
I'm going home.

572
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,170
Okay, bye.

573
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,710
Bye.

574
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,800
Senior Yoon!

575
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,240
Are you done?

576
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,010
Yes.

577
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,700
After the meeting, it was so hectic.

578
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,910
We didn't have a chance to talk.

579
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,350
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,380
You're suffering because of me.

581
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,410
I knew you would say that.

582
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,920
I was going to say I'm alright.

583
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,260
I'm really okay.

584
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,830
Since he thinks we're dating,

585
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,020
he'll surely split us up.

586
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,330
You're better than me.

587
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,150
You'll learn a lot of new things

588
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,470
at skincare and door-to-door.

589
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,670
Do your best.

590
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,070
Okay.

591
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,900
I'll work twice as hard,
so don't worry.

592
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,140
By the way,

593
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
the weather is so nice.

594
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,840
Are you not going to
throw me a farewell party?

595
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,680
I will,

596
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,190
but I'm a bit tired today.

597
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,460
Let's set a date soon.

598
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,260
Okay.

599
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,890
Get home safely.

600
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,860
You too, bye.

601
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,730
Bye.

602
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,170
You're home.

603
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,000
Thank you.

604
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,170
You should've let yourself in.

605
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,530
I have manners.

606
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,570
I don't barge into other people's houses,

607
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,830
even if you're my boyfriend.

608
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,000
Can you take a day off this week?

609
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,870
Why?

610
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,810
There's a problem with my wedding dress.

611
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,710
I'm going to change the shop.

612
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,310
I'll check my schedule.

613
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,010
Are you not going to ask

614
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,690
what problem it is?

615
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,760
You must have a good reason for it.

616
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,270
I guess I'm getting married alone.

617
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,040
It's my wedding dress anyway.

618
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
It's not someone else's problem.

619
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,870
I'll be careful from now on.

620
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,980
I'll get the earliest possible day off.

621
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,810
A lot happened today. I'm tired.

622
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,260
I'll get going now.

623
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,290
Hyo-joo.

624
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,330
You know, Jae-shin.

625
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,260
You can't walk all over me.

626
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
I do love you more,

627
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,570
but it's not my weakness.

628
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,090
This is really good for the complexion...

629
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,460
It goes like this, right?

630
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,620
Huh? What?

631
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,370
Song-ah.

632
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,810
Changes are hard, right?

633
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,170
Yes, a little.

634
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,140
It's been only two days,
so it must be awkward.

635
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,680
Still, how can you know just by his voice?

636
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,370
Lucky you, Hyun-seung.

637
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,080
Your trainer is so affectionate.

638
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,290
Oh, she's your ex-trainer now.

639
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,950
Get ready to go, Hyun-seung.

640
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,720
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,490
I'll introduce Hyun-seung
to the sales team.

642
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,840
To celebrate his transfer,

643
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,350
talk to Chief Kim

644
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,300
and ask for an increase in sales.

645
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,270
Hyun-seung.

646
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,400
Yes, sir.

647
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,340
Hang in there.

648
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,940
I will.

649
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,340
We'll be back.

650
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,710
Yes, this is Yoon Song-ah from KLAR.

651
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,450
Yes, Director Lee.

652
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,220
Director Lee asked to see me.

653
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,820
Tell him it's ABM Yoon Song-ah.

654
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,420
Please wait for a moment.

655
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,020
Sure.

656
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,060
Sir, ABM Yoon Song-ah is here.

657
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,900
Yes, sir.

658
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,910
You're here.

659
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,010
Hello, sir.

660
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,640
I've brought the product you asked for.

661
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,650
Good.

662
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,520
Okay, thanks.

663
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,050
Have you thought about it?

664
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,650
What I said at lunch the other time?

665
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,560
Well...

666
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,660
You're still thinking about it.

667
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,430
While you're at it, give it some thought.

668
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,920
It's the chance of a lifetime.

669
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,240
If you say you want to go,

670
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,540
I'll send you there for sure, okay?

671
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,440
You may go now.

672
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,130
What? I'm busy.

673
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,550
Jae-shin is at work, right?

674
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,230
Why would you ask me about him?

675
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,480
Of course, he's at work.

676
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,190
Two of these, please.

677
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,780
All right.

678
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,790
Lastly, two of these.

679
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,280
Pack them with the drinks
I ordered earlier.

680
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,130
Okay.

681
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,700
He decorated this place so well.

682
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,940
Did he pick these out himself?

683
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,680
Is omija tea okay?

684
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,600
Try it, I made the ingredients myself.

685
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,220
What a lovely color.

686
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,680
Thank you.

687
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,220
Am I bothering you at break time

688
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,490
when you should get some rest?

689
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,160
I'm okay if it's you, Yeon-seung.

690
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,970
What brings you here anyway?

691
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,500
Since you're always nice to us,

692
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,840
I want to thank you.

693
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,320
This is men's skincare.

694
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,010
My brother's company makes it.

695
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,310
My husband said it's good.

696
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm using this too.

697
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,450
Oh, really?

698
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,120
That's great!

699
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,100
Everyone has a different taste
for their skincare,

700
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,760
so I was a bit worried.

701
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,880
Thank you.

702
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,400
Did you choose the decorations yourself?

703
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,640
Or a girlfriend chose them for you?

704
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,140
They are so pretty.

705
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,220
I chose them myself.

706
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,140
I don't have a girlfriend.

707
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,210
Oh, why though?

708
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,620
You seem like a great guy.

709
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,750
Are you not interested in dating?

710
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,410
I am, but...

711
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,420
The reality is harder than you think.

712
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,430
Why?

713
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,490
Where there's a will, there's a way.

714
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,870
Perhaps you haven't met
the right person yet.

715
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,140
If you don't mind my asking,
what's your type?

716
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,730
There might be someone
I know who fits your type.

717
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,440
I don't know what type I like.

718
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,020
But there's a type I'm curious about.

719
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,920
Which type is that?

720
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,400
Ow, hot.

721
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,460
It's hot.

722
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,000
Yes, it's hot.

723
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,750
<i>But there's a type I'm curious about.</i>

724
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,620
He's talking about me, right?

725
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,930
He has an eye for beauty.

726
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,060
Who?

727
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,160
Oh, just someone I know.

728
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,870
Did someone say you're pretty?

729
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,210
Why do you ask?

730
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,080
That person might be conning you.

731
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,510
What?

732
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,380
You're not pretty, Mom.

733
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,180
What about Aunt Ji-seung?

734
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,080
She's pretty.

735
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,580
And Uncle Hyun-seung?

736
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,220
He's pretty.

737
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,020
And you?

738
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,820
I'm pretty.

739
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,150
Why aren't I pretty then?

740
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,760
Ask Grandma, not me.

741
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,160
A daughter is supposed
to support her mother.

742
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
But I can't lie.

743
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,460
Green light.

744
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,390
Go, Mom.

745
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,860
Hello.

746
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,490
Long time no see.

747
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,260
He's a newcomer.

748
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,750
Hello, I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

749
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,330
Let's talk later when we have time.

750
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,330
Okay.

751
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,730
Goodbye.

752
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,940
Hello.

753
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,470
Go introduce yourself.

754
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,310
Yes.

755
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,410
Hello, I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

756
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,210
Oh, hello.

757
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,320
Hello.

758
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,050
Hello.

759
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,080
He's the new ABM.

760
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,740
Oh.

761
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,420
Hello.

762
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,150
Nice to meet you.

763
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Hello.

764
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,020
Hello.

765
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,330
Hello, I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

766
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:38,860
Hi.

767
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,830
I look forward to working with you.

768
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:40,990
I'll get going now.

769
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,250
{\an8}GANGNAM

770
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,000
Chief Kim,

771
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,070
I want to introduce the new ABM.

772
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,790
Oh! He's new?

773
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,940
No, but he was assigned
to door-to-door this week.

774
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,140
Hyun-seung.

775
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,070
Right, I'm Chae Hyun-seung.

776
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,980
Nice to meet you.

777
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,350
Nice to meet you, I'm Kim Do-gyun.

778
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:57,910
Hello.

779
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,350
How long have you worked here?

780
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,720
I've never seen you before.

781
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,870
It's my first year.

782
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,650
So you have zero background
about door-to-door.

783
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,760
Have you been to the branch office?

784
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,960
I went once when I was an intern.

785
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,520
Then you haven't.

786
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,400
Are you free today?

787
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,290
Today?

788
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,230
It's up to you. Check your schedule.

789
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,500
I don't have anything important today.

790
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,330
It's settled then.

791
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,760
Hey, Manager Jin!

792
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,120
You're going to the branch office, right?

793
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,180
Yes.

794
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,880
Take the new ABM with you.

795
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,250
Teach him well.

796
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,490
Put the samples in the trunk.

797
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,050
Yes, sir.

798
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,460
Marketers should know
the situation on the field.

799
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,040
You all just sit at your desks.

800
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,340
That's not how you develop
a proper sales policy.

801
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,130
Fasten your seatbelt.

802
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,110
Yes, sir.

803
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,230
Three boxes.

804
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,050
Okay.

805
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,120
Here's your receipt.

806
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,390
Here.

807
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,360
Okay, thank you.

808
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,290
Goodbye.

809
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,900
Bye.

810
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,660
It looks heavy. I'll do it.

811
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,110
No, it's okay.

812
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,710
Do you really want to end it like this?

813
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,220
Is it that easy for you to move on?

814
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,750
Even if we break up, this isn't the way.

815
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,420
Just tell the director that
I won't join the TF team.

816
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,060
That's all I want to hear from you.

817
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,860
Is it because of Chae Hyun-seung?

818
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,230
Did he tell you not to go?

819
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,360
Let's go.

820
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm here!

821
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,200
Come on in.

822
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,160
Hello.

823
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,200
Nice to meet you.

824
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,030
Put the box here.

825
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,570
Yes, sir.

826
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,740
Coffee?

827
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,940
Perfect.

828
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,210
Hello.

829
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,840
Who is he? A newbie?

830
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,250
An ABM from KLAR.

831
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:20,950
He's doing door-to-door now, but
he's only done department stores before.

832
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,620
Coffee?

833
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,050
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

834
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,120
If an elder gives you
something, you take it.

835
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,330
You're such a geezer.

836
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,830
I'm glad that I don't have to make more.

837
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,300
I have something
to say to KLAR's marketing.

838
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,800
Good, pour it all out

839
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,170
so that they'll work properly.

840
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,110
Sit down.

841
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:46,210
Yes, sir.

842
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,380
Please tell me everything.

843
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,480
About the policy...

844
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,120
It's always a sample or 5:1 or 4:1.

845
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,090
What are you doing? Take notes.

846
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,730
Oh, right...

847
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,830
Can I use that pen and paper?

848
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,670
The policy is always 5:1 or 4:1...

849
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,910
Yes, but the policies should be...

850
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,410
We're back!

851
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,880
Did you sell a lot?

852
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,420
Oh! Manager Jin is here.

853
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,040
Did you bring something good?

854
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,050
I'm the good thing,
what more can you want?

855
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,520
Who is this?

856
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,260
An ABM from KLAR.

857
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,760
Oh! ABM!

858
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,290
So handsome! How old are you?

859
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,630
I sold a lot of KLAR products today.

860
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,160
Why didn't you give him a cup of coffee?

861
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:44,970
Do you want some coffee?

862
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,070
No, thanks. I don't like caffeine.

863
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:47,970
How about iced tea?

864
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,800
No, it's alright.

865
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,460
Over here! He's an ABM from KLAR!

866
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,200
Oh, hello.

867
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,740
Nice to meet you.

868
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,580
Hello.

869
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,080
We have a gathering later.

870
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,720
A gathering?

871
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,450
You should come!

872
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,470
It'll be fun.

873
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,560
<i>Yes, ma'am, I just got in.</i>

874
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:11,610
<i>Yes.</i>

875
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,830
I'll get my stuff and go home.

876
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:15,900
Yes.

877
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,700
Okay, see you tomorrow.

878
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,500
Goodbye.

879
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:20,700
Okay.

880
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,670
Chae Hyun-seung.

881
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,810
Okay. Rock, paper, scissors!

882
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,950
I'm going first.

883
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,680
I did it!

884
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,530
Did you really have dinner?

885
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,190
Your cheeks have sunken in.

886
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,110
It's because I worked outside today.

887
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,720
You should go home then. Why come here?

888
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,130
I said I'd be at Ha-eun's recital
but I couldn't make it.

889
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,230
So I'm keeping my promise today.

890
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,200
Because my pretty little niece
wants to see me!

891
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:26,900
Right, Ha-eun?

892
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,400
If you're tired, it's okay
to break one promise.

893
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,340
You can just tell me next time.

894
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,140
You're exhausting yourself
trying to make a living.

895
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,610
You understand it?

896
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,180
Is she really seven years old?

897
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,650
The kids these days don't act their age.

898
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,420
She's more like a 17-year-old girl.

899
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,300
Are you sure you're alright?

900
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,520
You don't look too good.

901
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,530
Honey, feel Hyun-seung's pulse!

902
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,900
No, it's okay.
I'm healthy. I'm really fine.

903
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,400
Still, I'll check your pulse later.

904
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,530
See me before you go.

905
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,240
You should.

906
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,070
Okay, thank you.

907
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,600
He's busy.

908
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,230
Checking your pulse won't help though.

909
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,210
What?

910
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,680
You got dumped, right?

911
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,180
I can tell.

912
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,490
Don't cry even though it hurts.

913
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,720
Love is supposed to hurt.

914
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,310
Who is she going to be when she grows up?

915
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,300
Is it really about a girl?

916
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,970
No, not at all.

917
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,830
How could you listen to a kid?

918
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,670
I want some cold water.

919
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,350
Sit. I'll get it for you.

920
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,210
Is it my turn?

921
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,690
Thank you.

922
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,540
Senior Yoon!

923
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,030
What are you doing here?

924
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,380
The Gangnam sales team wants to see me.

925
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:18,440
I see.

926
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,950
Are you alone?

927
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,550
Manager Kang said she's busy.

928
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,120
Is that so?

929
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,020
You're doing well, right?

930
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,490
Aren't you getting on?

931
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,860
Yes, just a moment!

932
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,060
Go on then.

933
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:32,730
Okay.

934
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:33,360
Keep it up.

935
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
You too.

936
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,500
<i>Don't worry, Senior Yoon!</i>

937
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,500
{\an8}CHAE HYUN-SEUNG

938
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,420
{\an8}WHOOSH WHOOSH

939
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,450
{\an8}BOOM BOOM

940
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:20,580
<i>Don't forget about my farewell party!</i>

941
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,130
Don't even think of
going home before midnight.

942
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:40,630
Okay, sir.

943
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,430
What song did you prepare?

944
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,390
I prepared "Ground Bee".

945
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,400
Good choice.

946
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:43,960
What about you?

947
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,730
I prepared "Unconditionally".

948
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,230
Oh! "Unconditionally"?

949
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,140
Write down your home address
and emergency contact number.

950
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,510
Why do you need this though?

951
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,920
Okay, let's go!

952
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,220
Yes, sir!

953
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,930
Oh, okay!

954
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,710
I'm going to head home.

955
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,340
Manager Kang,

956
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,980
how come Hyun-seung is not back yet?

957
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,120
He's probably at the gathering.

958
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,640
Why?

959
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,390
It's obvious.
They're trying to break him in.

960
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,140
You should've stopped them.

961
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,910
How could you let him go?

962
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,000
He should take care of himself.

963
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,030
Bye, guys.

964
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,230
Okay, bye.

965
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,070
Wow, she's so cold.

966
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,470
I'm so glad that she's not my trainer.

967
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,870
Let's go, Manager Ahn.

968
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,370
Take it easy, Song-ah.

969
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,470
Take care.

970
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,070
Bye.

971
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,060
Awesome!

972
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,900
Attention, please!

973
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,040
Let's propose a toast to all the ladies!

974
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,510
Chant, ready!

975
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,270
Chant, begin!

976
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,140
Flip the board!

977
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,280
Increase sales!

978
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,280
Meet the goal!

979
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,740
We are the kings of sales!

980
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,930
Bottoms up!

981
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,640
Have one more glass.

982
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,100
Yes, of course.

983
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,170
-Whoa.
-Oh, dear.

984
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,010
One more shot!

985
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,850
Bottoms up!

986
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,103
{\an8}ARE YOU STILL AT THE GATHERING?

987
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:48,153
{\an8}CHAE HYUN-SEUNG

988
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:12,173
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH:
HYUN-SEUNG, WHERE ARE YOU?

989
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,120
Manager Jin!

990
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,870
I love you all!

991
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,810
We love you!

992
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,210
It's a beautiful night.

993
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,650
Be happy.

994
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,560
<i>We'll form a TF team.</i>

995
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,370
The team will stay in Europe
for about three years.

996
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,010
Song-ah is one of the candidates.

997
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,250
I guess she hasn't told you yet.

998
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,320
So what?

999
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,080
Do whatever you can to make her go.

1000
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,630
She thought I recommended her
and so she refused to go.

1001
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,290
But she's competent enough for the job.

1002
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,660
She can decide on her own.

1003
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,170
That's why you don't know her.

1004
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,360
If she's stuck on something,

1005
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,540
she can't see anything else.

1006
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,300
So if you really care for her,

1007
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,410
make a sensible choice.

1008
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:03,220
I assume you know that much.

1009
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:31,180
There's nothing much to life.
Just enjoy it!

1010
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,250
Why isn't he picking up?

1011
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:40,960
Where did he go?

1012
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,020
Okay, who is no. 1 next year?

1013
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,890
KLAR!

1014
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:51,570
KLAR!

1015
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,570
Good!

1016
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,160
Let's go for round three!

1017
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,010
Are you serious, sir?

1018
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,310
I'll go if our ABM goes.

1019
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:06,880
That's enough. Stop.

1020
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,550
Hey, Marketing!

1021
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,240
At your service!

1022
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,590
How about round three?

1023
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,820
Yes, sir!

1024
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,440
He's going?

1025
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,930
Round three! Let's go!

1026
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,430
Huh?

1027
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,000
Huh?

1028
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,100
Go away.

1029
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,810
Manager Jin!

1030
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,840
Manager Jin.

1031
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:51,870
What is he doing?

1032
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,130
Why did you come so late?

1033
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,100
What?

1034
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,930
Seriously.

1035
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,260
Hey.

1036
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,990
I miss you.

1037
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:46,752
{\an8}SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

1038
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,680
<i>So the male model couldn't make it, is it?</i>

1039
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,840
<i>Wait.</i>

1040
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,760
<i>Me?</i>

1041
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,570
<i>Let's go, Hyun-seung.</i>

1042
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,290
<i>Are you involved in the Europe Project?</i>

1043
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,800
<i>It's such a good opportunity.</i>

1044
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,810
<i>You have to take it.</i>

1045
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:07,350
<i>Why is BM Lee taking Song-ah everywhere?</i>

1046
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,860
<i>Excuse me!</i>

1047
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:13,210
<i>KLAR Team. Yoon Song-ah.</i>

1048
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,920
<i>Are you going to Europe?</i>
