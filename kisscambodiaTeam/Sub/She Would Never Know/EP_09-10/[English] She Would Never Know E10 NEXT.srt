ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,940
Want to go for ice cream?

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
I like you.

4
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,580
I like you too.

5
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,650
It's warm tea.

6
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,479
It's hot, so grab it here.

7
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,520
Thanks.

8
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,479
So we're officially in a relationship now?

9
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,660
-Are we not?
-Not that.

10
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,420
I didn't say no.

11
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,539
If you said no, I was going to report you.

12
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,070
-To whom?
-Anyone.

13
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,680
114, 112, 119, 120. All of them.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,780
Everywhere.

15
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,540
Thank you.

16
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,490
For coming to me.

17
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,130
I want to thank you too.

18
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,530
For waiting for me.

19
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,640
Single-malt is good.

20
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,490
{\an8}EPISODE 10

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,020
How's the Europe TF team?

22
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,010
We're just starting,
so everyone's very driven.

23
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,420
The dynamics between
the members are great.

24
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,520
That's good.

25
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,290
It would've been better
if ABM Yoon'd join too.

26
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,329
Too bad she's not on the team.

27
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,300
It's a done deal.

28
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,900
Well, I hope you do well.

29
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,000
With the project and Hyo-joo.

30
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,170
Don't make Hyo-joo feel lonely.

31
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,410
That's the only thing I ask of you.

32
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,180
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

33
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,860
It's not even my wedding.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,850
You should get married too.

35
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,850
Of course.

36
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,050
I'll get married for sure.

37
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,160
You have someone in mind?

38
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,900
Huh?

39
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,170
Ow, my stomach.

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,870
I need to go to the bathroom.

41
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,650
He's in critical condition. Yes.

42
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,750
I'll report immediately. Okay.

43
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,030
Mr. Lee Jae-shin.

44
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,930
What happened?

45
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,970
Well...

46
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,579
<i>A warrant has been issued
in relation to the fraud.</i>

47
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,410
<i>He got into a car accident
while he was running away.</i>

48
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,450
You!

49
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,360
My money!

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,900
He needs surgery now,

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,440
but his blood pressure is too low.

52
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,130
They're waiting for it to stabilize.

53
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,490
Make way.

54
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,800
Please make way.

55
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,930
Mr. Lee Se-dong, can you hear me?

56
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,100
Cardiac arrest!

57
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,540
Bring the paddles.

58
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,180
150 joules.

59
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,950
Charge 150 joules.

60
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,650
All clear!

61
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,520
Again.

62
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,820
Charge 200 joules.

63
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,520
Clear!

64
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,310
Are you not going to bed?

65
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,620
Why did you fight with Song-ah?

66
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,090
She's on edge because
a lot is going on at work.

67
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,660
Just ignore her.

68
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,130
Did you know too?

69
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,890
Huh?

70
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Know what?

71
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,930
Nothing.

72
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,670
Go to bed.

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Okay.

74
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,460
Thanks for driving me home.

75
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,130
You're just going to leave?

76
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,320
It's the first day we got together.

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,700
You should be sad to say goodbye to me.

78
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
It's not that I'm not sad.

79
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,450
I'm still used to us
being a trainer and trainee.

80
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,750
We should get used to this quickly.

81
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,290
Now you're a bit surprised.

82
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,340
You're not surprised?

83
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,909
Are you kidding me?

84
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,540
I have to step it up then.

85
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,580
This is the furthest I'll go today.

86
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,550
But if you want me to go further, I will.

87
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,659
Seriously.

88
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,159
Senior Yoon.

89
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,890
Actually, I wanted to ask
what happened today.

90
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,060
But no matter how close we are,

91
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,840
I know there're some things
you want to keep to yourself.

92
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,710
I just hope you're not too upset by it.

93
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,110
Actually,

94
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,690
my mom and I...

95
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,490
Our relationship isn't normal.

96
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,360
I keep getting mad at her.

97
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,770
We got into a fight again
and I left the house.

98
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,600
Even though she said she's very sick.

99
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,770
Is it serious?

100
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,240
We'll find out once she gets surgery.

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,919
So we'll do that first.

102
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,440
It'll be alright.

103
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,510
I'll pray for her.

104
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,180
Also!

105
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,050
This one right here.

106
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,320
It's wide for a reason.

107
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,360
Not only can you lean on it,

108
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,960
but you can also walk and run on it.

109
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,330
Hold the Olympic games
on it every four years.

110
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,730
Come on.

111
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,000
That's why you shouldn't suffer alone.

112
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,670
Tell me everything.

113
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,310
Okay.

114
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,110
Okay.

115
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,850
Jae-shin.

116
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,960
Are you okay?

117
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,190
Yes.

118
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,690
I'll take care of the rest,
leave them to me.

119
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,590
Thanks.

120
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,700
Wait, I'll change into
mourning clothes too.

121
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,600
He's not worth your trouble.

122
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,010
Take a look and go home.

123
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,610
I'm a part of your family now.

124
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Jae-woon.

125
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,480
Director Lee.

126
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Hello.

127
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,530
Jae-shin.

128
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,380
I want to stay by Jae-shin's side.

129
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,180
Not now.

130
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,820
Just do what Jae-shin asks of you.

131
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,780
Grandpa wouldn't want you
to stay here too.

132
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,660
I can't believe this happened
before his wedding.

133
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,330
Are they going to postpone the wedding?

134
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,990
Of course. The wedding's two days later.

135
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,230
He doesn't have any other family members?

136
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,060
Not even his mother?

137
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,270
Seems like there's no one else.

138
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,270
Not even relatives.

139
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,370
Enough. Eat up,
we'll leave after eating.

140
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,650
FUNERAL CENTER

141
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,720
<i>I don't have any parents.</i>

142
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,200
Son!

143
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,660
<i>Stop visiting a stranger
and causing problems to him.</i>

144
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,290
<i>Bad parents are not even human, is it?</i>

145
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,790
Forget it.

146
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,620
I don't need a son like you.

147
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,430
Stay out of my life for good.

148
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,430
Let's see how well you live!

149
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,700
You're going to regret this!

150
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,850
You go in first.

151
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,420
You must be shocked.

152
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,060
Who would've thought...

153
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,800
The last thing I said to him was this.

154
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,970
Stay out of my life for good.

155
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,810
He never did what I asked.

156
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,280
But he accepted my request this time.

157
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,980
Don't think of it that way.

158
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,620
It's not that it happened
because of what you said.

159
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,990
I feel so empty.

160
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,570
It didn't happen when
I was struggling so much,

161
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,130
but look what happened now.

162
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,630
I guess it's all over now, right?

163
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,270
It's really over now, right?

164
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,940
<i>Hyun-seung.</i>

165
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,710
Yes?

166
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,060
Send me the achievement level
for each sales team.

167
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,490
Okay, I'll update it and send it to you.

168
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,030
Why is Song-ah absent today, Hyun-seung?

169
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,030
Oh, it's because today, she...

170
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,630
Why are you asking me that?

171
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,710
I know, right?

172
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,930
Why did I ask you that?

173
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Excuse me.

174
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,420
Yes, this is Chae Hyun-seung
from KLAR Team.

175
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,120
Oh, Chae Hyun-seung. I'm BM Seo.

176
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,190
Yes, sir.

177
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay, sir.

178
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,360
Who was that?

179
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,940
Seolyoon's BM.

180
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,400
BM Seo? Why?

181
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,410
Well...

182
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,940
Manager Kwon.

183
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,110
Yes?

184
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,370
BM Seo wants our product calendar

185
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,210
and job assignment sheet.

186
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,550
Should I give it to him?

187
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,890
Why is he asking for that?

188
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,050
I don't know.

189
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,060
Send him the materials. They're no secret.

190
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,090
Why does he want the documents?

191
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,590
Is he really going to join our team?

192
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,000
Why is he asking Hyun-seung for them?

193
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Since he's the youngest, he can't say no.

194
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,270
He's so cheeky.

195
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,170
Don't give him the materials.

196
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,340
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

197
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,140
-Manager Jo.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,780
-Take a look.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,050
Is your work going well?

200
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,150
Yes.

201
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,150
Good.

202
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,530
Get going then.

203
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,260
-I'll leave now.
-Bye.

204
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,440
Sit over here.

205
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,550
The shape doesn't look good
and the size is too big.

206
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,849
I think surgery is the best option.

207
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,060
Is there a possibility of it being cancer?

208
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,030
I can't be sure.

209
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,430
I can't tell from the ultrasound.

210
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,640
What will you do? Get surgery here?

211
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,440
Patient, please change into this.

212
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,130
Your surgery is tomorrow morning,

213
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,580
so no food after midnight.

214
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,810
Okay. Thank you.

215
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,250
That doctor is so cold.

216
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
It's because she's not the one who's sick.

217
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,690
Stay here, I'll go home
and get some stuff.

218
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,630
Don't come back.

219
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,650
I can be alone.

220
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,000
Okay then.

221
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Oh.

222
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,050
My taste buds are finally being soothed.

223
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,020
That restaurant was so bad.
Let's not go there again.

224
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,590
You're quite picky.

225
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,920
Let's just say my taste buds are delicate.

226
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,820
The scent is really good.

227
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,190
I acknowledge your taste in coffee.

228
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,760
Good-looking guys know their stuff.

229
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,800
You keep looking at your phone.

230
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,100
Are you expecting a call?

231
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,870
Yes.

232
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,070
From whom?

233
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,100
Someone.

234
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,440
What is it?

235
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,140
Something's fishy.

236
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,380
Are you...

237
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,880
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

238
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

239
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,610
Hold this for a second.

240
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,420
Okay.

241
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,150
Since you like it, it's yours.

242
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,090
I'll get going now.

243
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,410
Are you giving it to me?

244
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,430
Is he really dating?

245
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,090
Huh?

246
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,670
Hello?

247
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,640
Where are you?

248
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,010
<i>In front of my house.</i>

249
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,240
<i>My mom's hospitalized today.</i>

250
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
<i>I need to get some stuff.</i>

251
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,270
Did you have lunch?

252
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,680
I had lunch by myself a while ago.

253
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,220
I also grabbed a bite with my mom.

254
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Good.

255
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,520
You are feeling okay, right?

256
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,250
<i>Yes.</i>

257
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm not going to worry ahead.

258
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,120
<i>As you said, everything's going
to be alright.</i>

259
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,930
I miss you so much.

260
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,270
<i>You probably don't know,</i>

261
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,540
but I really want to say this to you.

262
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,640
I want to hear the sound of your voice.

263
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,610
I miss you. I like you.

264
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,940
I really want to say that.

265
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,880
I miss you.

266
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,320
I miss you too.

267
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,270
Look after Ha-eun for me.

268
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,260
Sorry, I'm the only one going on a date.

269
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,870
Have a great time with your anniversary.

270
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
Don't worry about Ha-eun.

271
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,440
She has a lot to do, so don't bother her.

272
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,170
I'm seven years old. I'm not a kid.

273
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,840
Thanks for taking care of her.

274
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,530
No problem.

275
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,400
Bye, Ha-eun.

276
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,310
-Have a good time.
-Bye.

277
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,210
Bye.

278
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,020
Ha-eun,

279
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,440
do you know what a date is?

280
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,620
You don't?

281
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,490
You haven't been on one, huh?

282
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,000
Ji-seung!

283
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,570
Huh? It's you!

284
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,070
Mommy!

285
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,390
What's gotten into her?

286
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,020
So it was because of you

287
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,800
that Ha-eun called me Mommy?

288
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,060
Yes.

289
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,060
I went through hell because of her.

290
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,130
I thought you were married.

291
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,080
So that's why you mentioned
a divorce lawsuit.

292
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,380
Hello, little miss.

293
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,630
Fail.

294
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,780
What?

295
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm sorry, but no.

296
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,450
You don't match at all.

297
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,340
Match what?

298
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,720
You have to be tall and handsome
like my uncle.

299
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,560
And younger than my aunt.

300
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,030
Is your uncle a movie star?

301
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,830
It's not easy to be
more attractive than me.

302
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,770
Right,

303
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,270
I'm younger than your aunt.

304
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,410
Yes. He's two years younger.

305
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,770
That's a lie.

306
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,640
Hey.

307
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,740
Do you want to see my ID?

308
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,020
Here.

309
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,980
{\an8}IDENTIFICATION CARD
LEE JAE-WOON, AUGUST 16, 1986

310
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,540
See? I'm two years younger.

311
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,890
He's right.

312
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,560
Give me back.

313
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,470
But when you're in love,

314
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,600
your heart is more important
than the requirements.

315
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,000
Do you like my aunt a lot?

316
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,210
I like her a lot.

317
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,280
Why?

318
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,680
I don't know. Do I need to pick one?

319
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,550
I can't pick just one.

320
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,620
Whether I see her or not,

321
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,090
I love her every minute, every second.

322
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,510
Isn't this true love?

323
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,560
Do you like him too?

324
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,450
Huh?

325
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,300
Do you?

326
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,270
Yes.

327
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,710
Pass.

328
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,440
Pass?

329
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,540
I pass?

330
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,780
Yes!

331
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
I don't know why I'm so happy.

332
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,490
TO MY LOVE, WOL-SOON

333
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,360
No.

334
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,430
I saw it wrong.

335
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,940
My husband would never do that.

336
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,380
Mom!

337
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,510
Huh?

338
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,710
Hi, Sweetie.

339
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,340
Why are you here?

340
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,210
Are you alright?

341
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Me?

342
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,490
Of course, I'm alright. Why wouldn't I be?

343
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,840
Take me with you!

344
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,140
Take me with you!

345
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,280
I can't live without you!

346
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,350
I'm going too!

347
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,350
Stop!

348
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,290
How can you leave me?

349
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,660
What am I supposed to do now?

350
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,870
I'm home.

351
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,440
What time is it?

352
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,580
I told you to come home
right after school.

353
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,050
What time is it now?

354
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,180
I was doing homework with my friends.

355
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,820
You can't even do homework alone?

356
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,290
Were you really doing homework?
Or were you playing?

357
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,290
You...

358
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,320
Don't you feel sorry for me?

359
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm alone without Dad,

360
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,730
and yet all you think about is yourself.

361
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,830
Now you're the only one I have.

362
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,540
You should take care of me
on behalf of your father.

363
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm not asking you to be exactly like him.

364
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,570
But you can't even do this little thing.

365
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,670
If I'm so bothersome to you,

366
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,920
I should just kill myself, right?

367
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,620
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,930
I won't be late again.

369
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,590
I'll take your blood pressure.

370
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,680
Where's your guardian?

371
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,930
I don't have one.

372
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,500
What?

373
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,090
You said you weren't coming back.

374
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,650
Should I leave then?

375
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,310
You should've brought more toilet paper.

376
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,760
I'll get going now.

377
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,130
See you tomorrow.

378
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,660
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

379
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,630
He's leaving on the dot.

380
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
-Where are you going?
-Leaving.

381
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,970
Bye. Take it easy.

382
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,830
Hey, stop.

383
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,200
I knew it.

384
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,400
It's more tiring for the carer
than the patient.

385
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,800
How can you eat kimbap
from the convenience store only?

386
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,270
I can never condone that.

387
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Thanks.

388
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,110
I had no idea you would show up.

389
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,110
I'm sad to hear that.

390
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,710
You have no expectations from me.

391
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,450
I guess I haven't shown you my charm.

392
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,260
That's why you fell for me so late.

393
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,930
Are you blaming me for
our belated relationship?

394
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,470
As always, you're smart.

395
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,830
Didn't you say I could take my time?

396
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,420
You know how words change

397
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,970
when you're trying
to get someone to like you.

398
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,030
Then I guess you were lying

399
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,040
when you talked about the beautiful love.

400
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,790
So that's what made you fall for me.

401
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,910
No, it's not.

402
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,260
It's amazing.

403
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,070
To see this kind of expression from you.

404
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,670
Not only will our love be beautiful,

405
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,540
it'll be the most beautiful thing
in the world.

406
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,650
It'll be something that
others will be jealous of!

407
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,070
Totally beautiful.

408
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,100
I can't believe it's been eight years.

409
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,830
Seems like yesterday
was our first blind date.

410
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,840
Honey.

411
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,040
When I saw you for the first time,

412
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,210
I thought it was a bust.

413
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,280
You did?

414
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,450
I thought you were a total fail.

415
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:27,565
<i>Your mouth was drawn tight
as if you were dragged there.</i>

416
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,930
<i>You lowered your eyes
and didn't say a thing.</i>

417
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,000
You're a Korean medicine doctor?

418
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,070
Yes. I passed the exam this year.

419
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,610
<i>But when we were leaving,</i>

420
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,310
<i>do you know why I asked
when we'll meet again?</i>

421
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,020
Because you kept looking at me.

422
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,050
What are you going to do next?

423
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,900
Open your own clinic?

424
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,990
Or get a job at a big hospital?

425
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,100
I'll work at a senior's hospital
for a year.

426
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,130
Then, I'll open my own clinic.

427
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,620
I heard competition is fierce now.

428
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,240
You can't simply open a clinic.

429
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,490
Especially not in Gangnam.

430
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,770
That's why the doctors also add skincare

431
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,010
or dieting to their practice.

432
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,250
They do.

433
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,850
But I'm thinking about
a clinic for children.

434
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,850
I see.

435
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,230
But you know...

436
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,440
<i>I realized you always looked
at me when I was talking.</i>

437
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,880
<i>And this thought popped into my head.</i>

438
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,810
<i>If I marry him,</i>

439
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,250
at least I won't be
shouting echoes in the air.

440
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,590
No matter how long we live together,

441
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,790
we'll have to face each other.

442
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,030
I don't want anything grand from you.

443
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,160
I know your personality.

444
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,030
All I want is for you to

445
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,960
look at me and listen to me,

446
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,370
just like what you did on that day.

447
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,470
Okay.

448
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,310
Sheesh.

449
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,310
I don't know why I like a nerd like you.

450
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,850
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

451
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,390
-How was it?
-It was great.

452
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,220
Right.

453
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,390
Let's have dinner with Chef Ryu.

454
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,960
With Han-seo? Why?

455
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm receiving a lot of help.

456
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,630
Also, we've decided to become friends.

457
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,560
Friends?

458
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,090
We've been talking
and we have a lot in common.

459
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,980
Don't take our relationship the wrong way.

460
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,080
We're literally just friends.

461
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,660
He's your best friend,

462
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,280
so it's good that I'm friends with him.

463
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,890
Why?

464
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,090
You don't like it?

465
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,060
It's fine. I'll set a date soon.

466
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:16,960
Let's go.

467
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,660
Okay.

468
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,810
You can go now. Give that to me.

469
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,340
This is heavier than it looks.

470
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,139
I'll walk you to the door.

471
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,850
Where is it?

472
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,580
This way.

473
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,350
This way?

474
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
You bought such a big one.

475
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,250
There are mangoes
and a bunch of other fruits.

476
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,620
Is it heavy?

477
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,980
See for yourself.

478
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,960
-It's really heavy.
-Right?

479
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,130
Sweetie!

480
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,630
Mom.

481
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,620
Who are you?

482
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,850
Oh, he's...

483
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,840
Hello, ma'am.

484
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,290
I'm Chae Hyun-seung.
I'm her junior at work.

485
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,130
Oh, you're her office junior.

486
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,860
Yes.

487
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,600
But why are you here?

488
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,360
Oh, that's...

489
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,730
He came as a representative.

490
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,330
After learning you're at the hospital.

491
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,510
Our team is like that.

492
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,470
If a family member is hospitalized,

493
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,310
the youngest one will come
as a representative.

494
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,900
Chae Hyun-seung is the youngest one.

495
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,950
Right, ABM Chae?

496
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,450
Yes, that's right.
I'm the youngest one on our team.

497
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,550
This is our tradition, ma'am.

498
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,220
How nice.

499
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,810
Thank you.

500
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,960
Step inside for a bit.

501
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,750
There's no need.

502
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,730
He was just leaving. Right?

503
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,630
Give that to me.

504
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,000
Here you go.

505
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,700
You can go now.

506
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,370
Thank you for coming, ABM Chae.

507
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,340
Sure.

508
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,340
I hope you get better soon.

509
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,940
It's such an honor to meet you today.

510
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,580
An honor...

511
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,620
Oh, dear.

512
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,020
I meant it's a pleasure seeing you.

513
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,860
I'll get going now.

514
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,850
Take care, ma'am.

515
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,730
Goodbye, Senior Yoon.

516
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,400
-Thanks for coming.
-Sure.

517
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,270
Come on. Let's go.

518
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,070
He's just your junior, right?

519
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,370
Of course.

520
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,080
Come on.

521
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,410
Alright.

522
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,130
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

523
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,130
<i>I'm sorry. My mom's edgy
about my love life.</i>

524
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,270
<i>I'll tell you the details next time.</i>

525
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,600
<i>It's okay. The surgery
will go well tomorrow,</i>

526
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,240
<i>so don't worry and get some sleep.</i>

527
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,890
Is this your first time
coming to a place like this?

528
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,090
Yes, it is.

529
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:37,860
Man.

530
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,100
You're a baby.

531
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,330
Manager Jo, transform him into a man.

532
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,540
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

533
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,900
You know him, right?
He's my right-hand man.

534
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,980
I've never been introduced.

535
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,780
I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR Team.

536
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm Jo In-gyung.

537
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,380
BM Seo complimented you for your work.

538
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,850
I look forward to working with you.

539
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,880
By the way, why did you call me here?

540
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,860
Oh, nothing.

541
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,200
Just socializing and becoming friends.

542
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,440
Here. Let's have a drink.

543
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,770
Now that I have a left-hand man as well,

544
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,540
my heart is feeling so full.

545
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,080
I should stop. Let's drink!

546
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,680
Cheers!

547
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,480
-Congratulations.
-Nice to meet you.

548
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,720
Why didn't you empty your glass?

549
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,060
I'm not familiar with whiskey.

550
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,030
Oh, is that so?

551
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,570
So adorable.

552
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,070
-He'll be so much fun to take around with.
-Yes, sir.

553
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,910
Good marketing comes from
this kind of experience.

554
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,880
You have to do everything
except breaking the law.

555
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,470
Tag along with us.

556
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,340
We'll teach you well.

557
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,820
Oh, so it's true that
you're coming to our team?

558
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, that?

559
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,680
Well, no. It's not confirmed yet.

560
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,960
It's as good as confirmed, sir.

561
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,000
Who will take that position if not you?

562
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,130
Seriously.

563
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,570
That's true, but...

564
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,540
I've a question for you.

565
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,440
How is the KLAR Team?

566
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,210
Do you think it's going well?

567
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,240
Yes, in my opinion.

568
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,710
I read that your trainer is Manager Kang.

569
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,880
Is she teaching you well?

570
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,120
Yes, she's training me well.

571
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,550
Well, it might be different
if you meet another trainer.

572
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,560
Most young people nowadays are like that.

573
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,730
I'm a very understanding person.

574
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,360
But Manager Kang
seems very individualistic.

575
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,160
She doesn't respect her seniors.

576
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,840
She'll harm the team spirit.

577
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I've had experience with her.

578
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,430
She's rude.

579
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,210
Why do you think she's that way?

580
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,410
Because her boss is too soft
to his subordinates.

581
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,850
Manager Kwon does let a lot slip by.

582
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,850
I know.

583
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,390
You agree with us, right?

584
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,760
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I belong here.

585
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,960
I'll get going now.

586
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,300
What are you doing?

587
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,940
How dare you stand up
without the BM's permission?

588
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,230
Don't you know who you are talking to?

589
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,170
Yes. I was naive and came unaware.

590
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,240
By the way...

591
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
Here.

592
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,980
This is for my drink.

593
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,340
Why you...

594
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,720
Right.

595
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,490
I hope you don't use
the company's credit card for this.

596
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,860
What?

597
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,400
That bugger.

598
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,880
It must be uncomfortable here.

599
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,950
You are still awake?

600
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,290
Man.

601
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,860
What will happen if I don't wake up
from the anesthetic?

602
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,480
You'll wake up.

603
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,290
Stop worrying and go to sleep.

604
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,300
By the way,

605
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,170
the young man earlier...

606
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,800
He's really not your boyfriend?

607
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,670
You said you have one.

608
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,380
I don't. I wasn't serious.

609
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,700
So...

610
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,350
When did you know?

611
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,850
About Dad?

612
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,560
Huh?

613
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,260
Is that important?

614
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,620
When I found out about it?

615
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,030
That's all you care about, is it?

616
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,870
Mom, why don't you break free from Dad?

617
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,660
Isn't it exhausting?

618
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,150
Hanging on to someone who won't return?

619
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,650
He betrayed you.

620
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,890
He just swayed for a moment.

621
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,660
He said he'd never leave me.

622
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,530
Anyway, he's no longer here.

623
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,030
So stop it.

624
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,340
You can live your life to the fullest
all on your own.

625
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,140
If you need love,
it doesn't have to be Dad.

626
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,710
Do you want to abandon me that badly?

627
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,920
That's not what I'm saying.

628
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,280
Why lead the conversation that way?

629
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,150
Because you really think like that.

630
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,510
I'm right, am I not?

631
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm just a burden to you.

632
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,500
If I don't call,

633
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,970
you don't call or text me at all.

634
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,160
I mean it.

635
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,600
Do you know how I
walk on eggshells around you?

636
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,440
I'm so sorry about how I treated you
after your dad died,

637
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,850
that I can't say anything to you.

638
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,410
I couldn't even call you
when I knew I was sick.

639
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,920
I was afraid you'd say
I've become more burdensome.

640
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,140
You only remember what I did wrong,

641
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,780
but you don't have a clue
how heartless you're being now.

642
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,060
Do you really feel sorry for me?

643
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,290
You think I have no sense of shame?

644
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,290
Then...

645
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,910
Set me free, Mom.

646
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,590
Whenever you're like this,

647
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,070
it's really hard for me.

648
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,550
It's too much for me, Mom.

649
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,270
Go to bed.

650
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,570
I'm going to bed too.

651
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,280
You haven't slept. Go get some rest.

652
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:01,970
I'll go get the door.

653
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Who is it?

654
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,010
Who are you?

655
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,300
Hello, is this Mr. Lee Jae-shin's house?

656
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,580
I'm a detective.

657
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,800
Detective?

658
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,230
What brings you here?

659
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,850
I'm Lee Jae-shin's wife.

660
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,590
This is the belonging
of the late Lee Se-dong.

661
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,950
Please pass this on to him.

662
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,390
Jae-shin,

663
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,470
this is left by your father.

664
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,650
Throw it away.

665
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,110
Without checking what it is?

666
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,080
We should check it.

667
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,930
I'm opening it.

668
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,550
I said throw it away!

669
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,050
You don't have to yell at me...

670
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,020
Go home. I'm going to get some rest.

671
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,120
Okay, let's end the meeting here.

672
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,980
The director needs time,

673
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,460
so we'll cover the total sales
of this month

674
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,060
and next month's product schedule.

675
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,870
Okay.

676
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,160
I wonder how the burial went.

677
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,910
Will the director come to work next week?

678
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,890
I think so.
He pushed back his honeymoon too.

679
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,887
There's so much to worry about.

680
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,160
I wonder if Song-ah's mother's
surgery went well.

681
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,600
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH:
THANKS. THE SURGERY JUST ENDED.

682
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,050
{\an8}THE DOCTOR SAID
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

683
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,050
I know.

684
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,060
She said it ended well just now.

685
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,520
Oh, I...

686
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,380
I'm the youngest one in our team.

687
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,070
Since I'm the youngest,

688
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:58,350
I think she texted me
as I'm the team representative.

689
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,170
Nobody asked.

690
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,800
Looks like you two are quite close.

691
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,070
You two aren't secretly dating, are you?

692
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,640
That's funny.

693
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,920
No, we aren't.

694
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,400
I...

695
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,480
I have a...

696
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,840
I have an in-house interview.

697
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,020
Since I won first place.

698
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,360
I'll go now.

699
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,310
-I'll do my best.
-Fight on.

700
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,990
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

701
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,110
See you later.

702
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,520
Okay, here we go.
With a brighter expression.

703
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,310
Smile naturally.

704
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,540
Relax.

705
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,700
Smile a bit more.

706
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,280
With a brighter expression.

707
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,570
Good. Great.

708
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,560
Okay, great.

709
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,250
If it's awkward,
why don't you hold a product?

710
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,060
-Hold it naturally.
-Okay.

711
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,000
Good.

712
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,570
Brighter smile.

713
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,520
Let's get a shot from below.

714
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,060
Great. No, just like that.

715
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,150
Hyun-seung.

716
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,810
Stop it.

717
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,110
Why? This is a good pose.

718
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,780
It's very obvious.

719
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,840
Looks like he's done this a lot.

720
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,220
A melancholy look. An autumn vibe.

721
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,340
A chic city boy.

722
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,470
Good, good.

723
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,680
Don't space out.

724
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,070
Move your hand a bit more naturally.

725
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,150
Good.

726
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,690
Great.

727
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,390
A bit more to this side?

728
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,770
That's great.

729
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,690
Let's go get coffee.

730
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,640
Coffee? Okay.

731
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:41,960
Good.

732
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,160
Can you hold a product?

733
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,370
Good. No.

734
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,380
The other side.

735
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,810
Good.

736
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,700
Are you nervous?

737
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,680
A little.

738
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,720
You did great in the photoshoot.

739
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,500
I did?

740
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,620
Just relax.

741
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:58,630
Okay.

742
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,050
We'll start the interview now.

743
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:01,670
Okay.

744
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,650
Please introduce yourself.

745
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,770
I'm ABM Chae Hyun-seung,
the youngest in the KLAR Team.

746
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:12,170
I work with a skincare
and door-to-door sales channel.

747
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,550
You're still here.

748
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,340
Oh, hey. You worked overtime too?

749
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,940
I'm leaving now. What about you?

750
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,580
I'm leaving after I wrap this up.

751
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,950
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

752
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,440
Want to go for a drink?

753
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Here you go.

754
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,430
Thank you.

755
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,270
Why is it just the two of you?

756
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,660
We were working overtime.

757
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,670
Min-seong left on the dot.

758
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,660
He was smart enough to do so.

759
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,320
Don't work overtime.

760
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,000
It'll become a habit.

761
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,450
Work isn't about how well you do your job.

762
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:12,250
So long as you can endure it,
you'll survive till the end.

763
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,440
Keep that in mind,

764
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,380
you little chicks.

765
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,870
You're too big to be a chick.

766
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:23,490
I'm too big, but I'm as cute as a chick.

767
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,530
Sorry.

768
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,310
Geez.

769
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,790
I give you words of wisdom
and this is what I get.

770
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,250
One bottle of soju, please.

771
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,290
Alright!

772
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,280
How was the interview?

773
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,960
It was fun.

774
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,560
You're dating, right?

775
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,550
Huh?

776
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,020
What are you talking about?

777
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,160
You're dating Senior Yoon Song-ah, right?

778
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,830
Geez.

779
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

780
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,750
You don't know about this, right?

781
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,240
You make it so obvious when you're dating.

782
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,740
You were like that in college too.

783
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,590
I thought it'd be best to let you know.

784
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,470
Be careful at work.
Unless you're going public.

785
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,940
Is it that obvious?

786
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,230
How did you know it was Senior Yoon?

787
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,110
We weren't together that much
after we started dating.

788
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,030
I could tell

789
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,080
from long ago.

790
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,960
I could see that you like her a lot.

791
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,420
I do.

792
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,820
Thanks anyway, I'll be careful.

793
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,630
You have to keep this a secret.

794
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,900
Don't tell Senior Yoon that you know.

795
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,250
Congratulations.

796
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,590
Thanks.

797
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,070
Cheers.

798
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,350
You'll be discharged today.

799
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,730
I'll text you the result
of your biopsy in a few days.

800
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,150
Can we get the results sooner?

801
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,690
It's the soonest you'll get.

802
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,480
By the way, when I actually saw it,

803
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,160
the shape and size weren't that bad.

804
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,410
You don't have to worry so much.

805
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,090
Thank you.

806
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,040
Oksu-dong, please.

807
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,750
Just go to Yongsan Station, please.

808
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,690
I'm going to Chuncheon.

809
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,560
It'll be hard for you to go alone.

810
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,650
How will you manage?

811
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,320
I feel more comfortable there.

812
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,890
I'm going to Chuncheon.

813
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,990
Mom.

814
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,270
Where should I go?

815
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,720
To Yongsan Station, please.

816
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,740
<i>Set me free, Mom.</i>

817
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,480
Whenever you're like this,

818
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,060
it's really hard for me.

819
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,160
<i>It's too much for me, Mom.</i>

820
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:35,710
Senior Yoon!

821
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,020
What do you think? Not bad, right?

822
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,790
Just wait. I'll make it better.

823
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,940
Let's do it together.

824
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,520
Okay.

825
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,860
Pull it.

826
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:58,900
Okay.

827
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,390
Should I stick it in here?

828
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,670
Yes, right there.

829
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,250
Ouch.

830
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,890
Be careful.

831
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,830
You're so silly.

832
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,730
Clean it up.

833
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,620
She's small but strong.

834
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,100
You really know how to do it?

835
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,170
It's my first time.

836
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,190
It's catching on.

837
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,010
Good job!

838
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,670
You're good at it.

839
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,150
Great job!

840
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,720
Again! Do it again.

841
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,460
Be careful.

842
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,020
-Stop fooling around.
-Ow! You stepped on my foot!

843
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,140
Sorry.

844
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:16,930
Do you feel better now?

845
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,310
How about the cold?

846
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,010
I'm good.

847
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,760
My mom will

848
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,530
be okay, right?

849
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,460
I shouldn't have gone too far.

850
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,050
I know it'll become a knot in her heart.

851
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,020
But it's strange though.

852
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,390
I can't help saying those things to her.

853
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:01,590
That I hate it.

854
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,320
That it's a burden.

855
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,820
That it's hard for me.

856
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,850
As a matter of fact,

857
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,290
no matter how hard I try,

858
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,960
I can't understand her.

859
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:24,190
Why is she so afraid of letting Dad go?

860
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,460
I thought I would get it.

861
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,390
I thought I would be able
to understand her

862
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,260
when I grew up and loved someone.

863
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,100
But I can't understand her.

864
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,890
Maybe it's because I'm determined.

865
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:53,000
Determined not to be like my mom.

866
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,490
That's why I'm like this.

867
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:09,060
I don't want to risk everything for love.

868
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,990
I don't want to be like my mom.

869
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,980
It's okay.

870
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,870
I'll be the one.

871
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,700
I'll risk everything for love.

872
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:52,538
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

873
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:53,235
<i>The Renew Stick.</i>

874
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,680
<i>I heard Seolyoon is preparing it too.</i>

875
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,700
<i>Are you launching the Renew Stick?</i>

876
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,780
<i>It's a different brand anyway.
What's the problem?</i>

877
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,880
<i>ABM Chae Hyun-seung, you can't accept
launching it with Seolyoon?</i>

878
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,430
<i>Why are you pushing me away again?</i>

879
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,649
<i>If you didn't want this, you shouldn't
have forced me into this.</i>

880
01:02:08,649 --> 01:02:12,610
<i>If this is all you can do,
just end it then!</i>

881
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:13,860
<i>Let's end this.</i>

882
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,930
<i>I'm not good at hiding my feelings.</i>

883
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,960
<i>Since I like someone so much...</i>

884
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,750
<i>Everyone will know we're dating
because of you.</i>
