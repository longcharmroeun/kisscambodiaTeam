-Are we not?
-Not that.

I didn't say no.

12

-Anyone.

We're just starting,
so everyone's very driven.

It would've been better
if ABM Yoon'd join too.

27
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,329
Too bad she's not on the team.

28

Why did you fight with Song-ah?

67

She's on edge because
a lot is going on at work.

It's the first day we got together.

It's not that I'm not sad.

But no matter how close we are,

92
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,840
I know there're some things
you want to keep to yourself.

93

We got into a fight again
and I left the house.

99

Even though she said she's very sick.

100
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,770
Is it serious?

101
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,240
We'll find out once she gets surgery.

102
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
So we'll do that first.

103
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,440

Not only can you lean on it,

109
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,960

Of course. The wedding's two days later.

136

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,550
Should I give it to him?

188
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,890
Why is he asking for that?

189
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,050
I don't know.

190
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,060
Send him the materials. They're no secret.

191
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,090
Why does he want the documents?

192
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,590
Is he really going to join our team?

193
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,000
Why is he asking Hyun-seung for them?

194
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
Since he's the youngest, he can't say no.

195
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,270
He's so cheeky.

196
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,170
Don't give him the materials.

197
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,340
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

198
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,140
-Manager Jo.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,780
-Take a look.
-Yes, sir.

200
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,050
Is your work going well?

201
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,150
Yes.

202
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,150
Good.

203
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,530
Get going then.

204
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,260
-I'll leave now.
-Bye.

205
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,440
Sit over here.

206
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,550
The shape doesn't look good
and the size is too big.

207
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,849
I think surgery is the best option.

208
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,060
Is there a possibility of it being cancer?

209
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,030
I can't be sure.

210
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,430
I can't tell from the ultrasound.

211
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,640
What will you do? Get surgery here?

212
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,440
Patient, please change into this.

213
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,130
Your surgery is tomorrow morning,

214
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,580
so no food after midnight.

215
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,810
Okay. Thank you.

216
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,250
That doctor is so cold.

217
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
It's because she's not the one who's sick.

218
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,690
Stay here, I'll go home
and get some stuff.

219
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,630
Don't come back.

220
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,650
I can be alone.

221
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay then.

222
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Oh.

223
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,050
My taste buds are finally being soothed.

224
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,020
That restaurant was so bad.
Let's not go there again.

225
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,590
You're quite picky.

226
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,920
Let's just say my taste buds are delicate.

227
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,820
The scent is really good.

228
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,190
I acknowledge your taste in coffee.

229
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,760
Good-looking guys know their stuff.

230
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,800
You keep looking at your phone.

231
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,100
Are you expecting a call?

232
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,870
Yes.

233
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,070
From whom?

234
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,100
Someone.

235
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,440
What is it?

236
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,140
Something's fishy.

237
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,380
Are you...

238
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,880
[Senior Yoon Song-ah]

239
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,880
[Have you eaten?]

240
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,610
Hold this for a second.

241
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,420
Okay.

242
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,150
Since you like it, it's yours.

243
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,090
I'll get going now.

244
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,410
Are you giving it to me?

245
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,430
Is he really dating?

246
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,090
Huh?

247
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,670
Hello?

248
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,640
Where are you?

249
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,010
[In front of my house.]

250
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,240
[My mom's hospitalized today.]

251
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,640
[I need to get some stuff.]

252
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,270
Did you have lunch?

253
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,680
I had lunch by myself a while ago.

254
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,220
I also grabbed a bite with my mom.

255
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Good.

256
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,520
You are feeling okay, right?

257
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,250
[Yes.]

258
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,320
I'm not going to worry ahead.

259
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,120
[As you said, everything's going
to be alright.]

260
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,930
I miss you so much.

261
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,270
[You probably don't know,]

262
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,540
but I really want to say this to you.

263
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,640
I want to hear the sound of your voice.

264
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,610
I miss you. I like you.

265
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,940
I really want to say that.

266
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,880
I miss you.

267
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,320
I miss you too.

268
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,270
Look after Ha-eun for me.

269
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,260
Sorry, I'm the only one going on a date.

270
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,870
Have a great time with your anniversary.

271
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,160
Don't worry about Ha-eun.

272
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,440
She has a lot to do, so don't bother her.

273
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,170
I'm seven years old. I'm not a kid.

274
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,840
Thanks for taking care of her.

275
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,530
No problem.

276
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,400
Bye, Ha-eun.

277
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,310
-Have a good time.
-Bye.

278
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,210
Bye.

279
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,020
Ha-eun,

280
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,440
do you know what a date is?

281
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,620
You don't?

282
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,490
You haven't been on one, huh?

283
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,000
Ji-seung!

284
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,570
Huh? It's you!

285
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,070
Mommy!

286
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,390
What's gotten into her?

287
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,020
So it was because of you

288
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,800
that Ha-eun called me Mommy?

289
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,060
Yes.

290
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,060
I went through hell because of her.

291
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,130
I thought you were married.

292
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,080
So that's why you mentioned
a divorce lawsuit.

293
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,380
Hello, little miss.

294
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,630
Fail.

295
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,780
What?

296
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm sorry, but no.

297
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,450
You don't match at all.

298
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,340
Match what?

299
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,720
You have to be tall and handsome
like my uncle.

300
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,560
And younger than my aunt.

301
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,030
Is your uncle a movie star?

302
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,830
It's not easy to be
more attractive than me.

303
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,770
Right,

304
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,270
I'm younger than your aunt.

305
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,410
Yes. He's two years younger.

306
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,770
That's a lie.

307
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,640
Hey.

308
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,740
Do you want to see my ID?

309
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,020
Here.

310
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,980
[Identification Card]
[Lee Jae-woon, August 16, 1986]

311
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,540
See? I'm two years younger.

312
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,890
He's right.

313
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,560
Give me back.

314
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,470
But when you're in love,

315
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,600
your heart is more important
than the requirements.

316
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,000
Do you like my aunt a lot?

317
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,210
I like her a lot.

318
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,280
Why?

319
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,680
I don't know. Do I need to pick one?

320
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,550
I can't pick just one.

321
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,620
Whether I see her or not,

322
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,090
I love her every minute, every second.

323
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,510
Isn't this true love?

324
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,560
Do you like him too?

325
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,450
Huh?

326
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,300
Do you?

327
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,270
Yes.

328
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,710
Pass.

329
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,440
Pass?

330
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,540
I pass?

331
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,780
Yes!

332
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,360
No.

335
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,430
I saw it wrong.

336
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,940
My husband would never do that.

337
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,380
Mom!

338
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,510
Huh?

339
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,710
Hi, Sweetie.

340
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,340
Why are you here?

341
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,210
Are you alright?

342
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Me?

343
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,490
Of course, I'm alright. Why wouldn't I be?

344
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,840
Take me with you!

345
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,140
Take me with you!

346
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,280
I can't live without you!

347
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,350
I'm going too!

348
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,350
Stop!

349
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,290
How can you leave me?

350
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,660
What am I supposed to do now?

351
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,870
I'm home.

352
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,440
What time is it?

353
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,580
I told you to come home
right after school.

354
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,050
What time is it now?

355
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,180
I was doing homework with my friends.

356
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,820
You can't even do homework alone?

357
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,290
Were you really doing homework?
Or were you playing?

358
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,290
You...

359
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,320
Don't you feel sorry for me?

360
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm alone without Dad,

361
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,730
and yet all you think about is yourself.

362
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,830
Now you're the only one I have.

363
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,540
You should take care of me
on behalf of your father.

364
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,120
I'm not asking you to be exactly like him.

365
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,570
But you can't even do this little thing.

366
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,670
If I'm so bothersome to you,

367
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,920
I should just kill myself, right?

368
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,620
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,930
I won't be late again.

370
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,590
I'll take your blood pressure.

371
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,680
Where's your guardian?

372
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,930
I don't have one.

373
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,500
What?

374
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,090
You said you weren't coming back.

375
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,650
Should I leave then?

376
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,310
You should've brought more toilet paper.

377
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,760
I'll get going now.

378
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,130
See you tomorrow.

379
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,660
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

380
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,630
He's leaving on the dot.

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
-Where are you going?
-Leaving.

382
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,970
Bye. Take it easy.

383
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,830
Hey, stop.

384
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,200
I knew it.

385
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,400
It's more tiring for the carer
than the patient.

386
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,800
How can you eat kimbap
from the convenience store only?

387
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,270
I can never condone that.

388
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Thanks.

389
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,110
I had no idea you would show up.

390
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,110
I'm sad to hear that.

391
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,710
You have no expectations from me.

392
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,450
I guess I haven't shown you my charm.

393
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,260
That's why you fell for me so late.

394
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,930
Are you blaming me for
our belated relationship?

395
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,470
As always, you're smart.

396
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,830
Didn't you say I could take my time?

397
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,420
You know how words change

398
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,970
when you're trying
to get someone to like you.

399
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,030
Then I guess you were lying

400
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,040
when you talked about the beautiful love.

401
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,790
So that's what made you fall for me.

402
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,910
No, it's not.

403
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,260
It's amazing.

404
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,070
To see this kind of expression from you.

405
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,670
Not only will our love be beautiful,

406
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,540
it'll be the most beautiful thing
in the world.

407
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,650
It'll be something that
others will be jealous of!

408
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,070
Totally beautiful.

409
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,100
I can't believe it's been eight years.

410
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,830
Seems like yesterday
was our first blind date.

411
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,840
Honey.

412
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,040
When I saw you for the first time,

413
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,210
I thought it was a bust.

414
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,280
You did?

415
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,450
I thought you were a total fail.

416
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,590
[Your mouth was drawn tight
as if you were dragged there.]

417
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,930
[You lowered your eyes
and didn't say a thing.]

418
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,000
You're a Korean medicine doctor?

419
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,070
Yes. I passed the exam this year.

420
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,610
[But when we were leaving,]

421
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,310
[do you know why I asked
when we'll meet again?]

422
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,020
Because you kept looking at me.

423
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,050
What are you going to do next?

424
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,900
Open your own clinic?

425
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,990
Or get a job at a big hospital?

426
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,100
I'll work at a senior's hospital
for a year.

427
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,130
Then, I'll open my own clinic.

428
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,620
I heard competition is fierce now.

429
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,240
You can't simply open a clinic.

430
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,490
Especially not in Gangnam.

431
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,770
That's why the doctors also add skincare

432
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,010
or dieting to their practice.

433
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,250
They do.

434
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,850
But I'm thinking about
a clinic for children.

435
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,850
I see.

436
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,230
But you know...

437
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,440
[I realized you always looked
at me when I was talking.]

438
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,880
[And this thought popped into my head.]

439
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,810
[If I marry him,]

440
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,250
at least I won't be
shouting echoes in the air.

441
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,590
No matter how long we live together,

442
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,790
we'll have to face each other.

443
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,030
I don't want anything grand from you.

444
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,160
I know your personality.

445
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,030
All I want is for you to

446
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,960
look at me and listen to me,

447
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,370
just like what you did on that day.

448
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,470
Okay.

449
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,310
Sheesh.

450
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,310
I don't know why I like a nerd like you.

451
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,850
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

452
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,390
-How was it?
-It was great.

453
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,220
Right.

454
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,390
Let's have dinner with Chef Ryu.

455
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,960
With Han-seo? Why?

456
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm receiving a lot of help.

457
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,630
Also, we've decided to become friends.

458
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,560
Friends?

459
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,090
We've been talking
and we have a lot in common.

460
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,980
Don't take our relationship the wrong way.

461
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,080
We're literally just friends.

462
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,660
He's your best friend,

463
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,280
so it's good that I'm friends with him.

464
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,890
Why?

465
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,090
You don't like it?

466
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,060
It's fine. I'll set a date soon.

467
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,960
Let's go.

468
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,660
Okay.

469
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,810
You can go now. Give that to me.

470
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,340
This is heavier than it looks.

471
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,139
I'll walk you to the door.

472
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,850
Where is it?

473
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,580
This way.

474
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,350
This way?

475
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,920
You bought such a big one.

476
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,250
There are mangoes
and a bunch of other fruits.

477
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,620
Is it heavy?

478
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,980
See for yourself.

479
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,960
-It's really heavy.
-Right?

480
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,130
Sweetie!

481
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,630
Mom.

482
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,520
Who are you?

483
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,750
Oh, he's...

484
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,740
Hello, ma'am.

485
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,190
I'm Chae Hyun-seung.
I'm her junior at work.

486
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,030
Oh, you're her office junior.

487
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,760
Yes.

488
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,500
But why are you here?

489
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,260
Oh, that's...

490
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,630
He came as a representative.

491
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,230
After learning you're at the hospital.

492
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,410
Our team is like that.

493
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,370
If a family member is hospitalized,

494
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,210
the youngest one will come
as a representative.

495
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,800
Chae Hyun-seung is the youngest one.

496
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,850
Right, ABM Chae?

497
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,350
Yes, that's right.
I'm the youngest one on our team.

498
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,450
This is our tradition, ma'am.

499
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,120
How nice.

500
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,710
Thank you.

501
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,860
Step inside for a bit.

502
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,650
There's no need.

503
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,630
He was just leaving. Right?

504
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,530
Give that to me.

505
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,900
Here you go.

506
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,600
You can go now.

507
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,270
Thank you for coming, ABM Chae.

508
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,240
Sure.

509
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,240
I hope you get better soon.

510
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,840
It's such an honor to meet you today.

511
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,480
An honor...

512
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,520
Oh, dear.

513
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,920
I meant it's a pleasure seeing you.

514
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,760
I'll get going now.

515
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,750
Take care, ma'am.

516
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,630
Goodbye, Senior Yoon.

517
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,300
-Thanks for coming.
-Sure.

518
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,170
Come on. Let's go.

519
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,970
He's just your junior, right?

520
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,270
Of course.

521
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,980
Come on.

522
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,310
Alright.

523
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,030
[Senior Yoon Song-ah]

524
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,030
[I'm sorry. My mom's edgy
about my love life.]

525
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,170
[I'll tell you the details next time.]

526
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,500
[It's okay. The surgery
will go well tomorrow,]

527
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,140
[so don't worry and get some sleep.]

528
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,790
Is this your first time
coming to a place like this?

529
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,990
Yes, it is.

530
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,760
Man.

531
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,000
You're a baby.

532
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,230
Manager Jo, transform him into a man.

533
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,440
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

534
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,800
You know him, right?
He's my right-hand man.

535
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,880
I've never been introduced.

536
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,680
I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR Team.

537
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,580
I'm Jo In-gyung.

538
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,280
BM Seo complimented you for your work.

539
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,750
I look forward to working with you.

540
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,780
By the way, why did you call me here?

541
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,760
Oh, nothing.

542
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,100
Just socializing and becoming friends.

543
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,340
Here. Let's have a drink.

544
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,670
Now that I have a left-hand man as well,

545
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,440
my heart is feeling so full.

546
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,980
I should stop. Let's drink!

547
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,580
Cheers!

548
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,380
-Congratulations.
-Nice to meet you.

549
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,620
Why didn't you empty your glass?

550
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,960
I'm not familiar with whiskey.

551
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,930
Oh, is that so?

552
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,470
So adorable.

553
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,970
-He'll be so much fun to take around with.
-Yes, sir.

554
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,810
Good marketing comes from
this kind of experience.

555
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,780
You have to do everything
except breaking the law.

556
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,370
Tag along with us.

557
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,240
We'll teach you well.

558
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,720
Oh, so it's true that
you're coming to our team?

559
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,860
Oh, that?

560
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,580
Well, no. It's not confirmed yet.

561
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,860
It's as good as confirmed, sir.

562
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,900
Who will take that position if not you?

563
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,030
Seriously.

564
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,470
That's true, but...

565
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,440
I've a question for you.

566
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,340
How is the KLAR Team?

567
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,110
Do you think it's going well?

568
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,140
Yes, in my opinion.

569
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,610
I read that your trainer is Manager Kang.

570
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,780
Is she teaching you well?

571
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,020
Yes, she's training me well.

572
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,450
Well, it might be different
if you meet another trainer.

573
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,460
Most young people nowadays are like that.

574
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,630
I'm a very understanding person.

575
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,260
But Manager Kang
seems very individualistic.

576
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,060
She doesn't respect her seniors.

577
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,740
She'll harm the team spirit.

578
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
I've had experience with her.

579
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,330
She's rude.

580
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,110
Why do you think she's that way?

581
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:56,310
Because her boss is too soft
to his subordinates.

582
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,750
Manager Kwon does let a lot slip by.

583
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,750
I know.

584
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,290
You agree with us, right?

585
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,660
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I belong here.

586
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,860
I'll get going now.

587
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,200
What are you doing?

588
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,840
How dare you stand up
without the BM's permission?

589
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,130
Don't you know who you are talking to?

590
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,070
Yes. I was naive and came unaware.

591
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,140
By the way...

592
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Here.

593
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,880
This is for my drink.

594
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,240
Why you...

595
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,620
Right.

596
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:42,390
I hope you don't use
the company's credit card for this.

597
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,760
What?

598
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,300
That bugger.

599
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,780
It must be uncomfortable here.

600
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,850
You are still awake?

601
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,190
Man.

602
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,760
What will happen if I don't wake up
from the anesthetic?

603
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,380
You'll wake up.

604
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,190
Stop worrying and go to sleep.

605
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,200
By the way,

606
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,070
the young man earlier...

607
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,700
He's really not your boyfriend?

608
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,570
You said you have one.

609
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,280
I don't. I wasn't serious.

610
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
So...

611
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,250
When did you know?

612
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,750
About Dad?

613
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,460
Huh?

614
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,160
Is that important?

615
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,520
When I found out about it?

616
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,930
That's all you care about, is it?

617
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,770
Mom, why don't you break free from Dad?

618
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,560
Isn't it exhausting?

619
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,050
Hanging on to someone who won't return?

620
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,550
He betrayed you.

621
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,790
He just swayed for a moment.

622
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,560
He said he'd never leave me.

623
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,430
Anyway, he's no longer here.

624
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,930
So stop it.

625
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,240
You can live your life to the fullest
all on your own.

626
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,040
If you need love,
it doesn't have to be Dad.

627
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,610
Do you want to abandon me that badly?

628
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,820
That's not what I'm saying.

629
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,180
Why lead the conversation that way?

630
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,050
Because you really think like that.

631
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,410
I'm right, am I not?

632
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,060
I'm just a burden to you.

633
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,400
If I don't call,

634
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,870
you don't call or text me at all.

635
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,060
I mean it.

636
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,500
Do you know how I
walk on eggshells around you?

637
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,340
I'm so sorry about how I treated you
after your dad died,

638
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,750
that I can't say anything to you.

639
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,310
I couldn't even call you
when I knew I was sick.

640
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,820
I was afraid you'd say
I've become more burdensome.

641
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,040
You only remember what I did wrong,

642
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,680
but you don't have a clue
how heartless you're being now.

643
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,960
Do you really feel sorry for me?

644
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,190
You think I have no sense of shame?

645
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,190
Then...

646
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,810
Set me free, Mom.

647
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,490
Whenever you're like this,

648
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,970
it's really hard for me.

649
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,450
It's too much for me, Mom.

650
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,170
Go to bed.

651
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,470
I'm going to bed too.

652
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,180
You haven't slept. Go get some rest.

653
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,870
I'll go get the door.

654
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Who is it?

655
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,910
Who are you?

656
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,200
Hello, is this Mr. Lee Jae-shin's house?

657
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,480
I'm a detective.

658
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,700
Detective?

659
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,130
What brings you here?

660
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,750
I'm Lee Jae-shin's wife.

661
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,490
This is the belonging
of the late Lee Se-dong.

662
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,850
Please pass this on to him.

663
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,290
Jae-shin,

664
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,370
this is left by your father.

665
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,550
Throw it away.

666
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,010
Without checking what it is?

667
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,980
We should check it.

668
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,830
I'm opening it.

669
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,450
I said throw it away!

670
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,950
You don't have to yell at me...

671
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,920
Go home. I'm going to get some rest.

672
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,020
Okay, let's end the meeting here.

673
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,880
The director needs time,

674
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,360
so we'll cover the total sales
of this month

675
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,960
and next month's product schedule.

676
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:07,770
Okay.

677
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,060
I wonder how the burial went.

678
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,810
Will the director come to work next week?

679
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,790
I think so.
He pushed back his honeymoon too.

680
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,800
There's so much to worry about.

681
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,060
I wonder if Song-ah's mother's
surgery went well.

682
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,500
[Senior Yoon Song-ah:
Thanks. The surgery just ended.]

683
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,950
[The doctor said
there's nothing to worry about.]

684
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:21,950
I know.

685
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,960
She said it ended well just now.

686
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,420
Oh, I...

687
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,280
I'm the youngest one in our team.

688
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,970
Since I'm the youngest,

689
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,250
I think she texted me
as I'm the team representative.

690
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,070
Nobody asked.

691
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,700
Looks like you two are quite close.

692
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,970
You two aren't secretly dating, are you?

693
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,540
That's funny.

694
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,820
No, we aren't.

695
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,300
I...

696
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,380
I have a...

697
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,740
I have an in-house interview.

698
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,920
Since I won first place.

699
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,260
I'll go now.

700
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,210
-I'll do my best.
-Fight on.

701
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,890
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

702
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,010
See you later.

703
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,420
Okay, here we go.
With a brighter expression.

704
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,210
Smile naturally.

705
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,440
Relax.

706
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,600
Smile a bit more.

707
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,180
With a brighter expression.

708
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,470
Good. Great.

709
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,460
Okay, great.

710
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,150
If it's awkward,
why don't you hold a product?

711
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,960
-Hold it naturally.
-Okay.

712
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,900
Good.

713
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,470
Brighter smile.

714
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,420
Let's get a shot from below.

715
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,960
Great. No, just like that.

716
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,050
Hyun-seung.

717
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,710
Stop it.

718
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,010
Why? This is a good pose.

719
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,680
It's very obvious.

720
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,740
Looks like he's done this a lot.

721
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,120
A melancholy look. An autumn vibe.

722
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,240
A chic city boy.

723
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,370
Good, good.

724
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,580
Don't space out.

725
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,970
Move your hand a bit more naturally.

726
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,050
Good.

727
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,590
Great.

728
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,290
A bit more to this side?

729
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,670
That's great.

730
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,590
Let's go get coffee.

731
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,540
Coffee? Okay.

732
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:29,860
Good.

733
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,060
Can you hold a product?

734
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,270
Good. No.

735
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,280
The other side.

736
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,710
Good.

737
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,600
Are you nervous?

738
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,580
A little.

739
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,620
You did great in the photoshoot.

740
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,400
I did?

741
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,520
Just relax.

742
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:46,530
Okay.

743
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,950
We'll start the interview now.

744
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,570
Okay.

745
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,550
Please introduce yourself.

746
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,670
I'm ABM Chae Hyun-seung,
the youngest in the KLAR Team.

747
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,070
I work with a skincare
and door-to-door sales channel.

748
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,450
You're still here.

749
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,240
Oh, hey. You worked overtime too?

750
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,840
I'm leaving now. What about you?

751
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,480
I'm leaving after I wrap this up.

752
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,850
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

753
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,340
Want to go for a drink?

754
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
Here you go.

755
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,330
Thank you.

756
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:41,170
Why is it just the two of you?

757
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,560
We were working overtime.

758
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,570
Min-seong left on the dot.

759
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,560
He was smart enough to do so.

760
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,220
Don't work overtime.

761
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,900
It'll become a habit.

762
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,350
Work isn't about how well you do your job.

763
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:00,150
So long as you can endure it,
you'll survive till the end.

764
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,340
Keep that in mind,

765
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,280
you little chicks.

766
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,770
You're too big to be a chick.

767
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,390
I'm too big, but I'm as cute as a chick.

768
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,430
Sorry.

769
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,210
Geez.

770
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,690
I give you words of wisdom
and this is what I get.

771
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,150
One bottle of soju, please.

772
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,190
Alright!

773
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,180
How was the interview?

774
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,860
It was fun.

775
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,460
You're dating, right?

776
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,450
Huh?

777
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,920
What are you talking about?

778
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,060
You're dating Senior Yoon Song-ah, right?

779
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,730
Geez.

780
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

781
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,650
You don't know about this, right?

782
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,140
You make it so obvious when you're dating.

783
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,640
You were like that in college too.

784
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,490
I thought it'd be best to let you know.

785
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,370
Be careful at work.
Unless you're going public.

786
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,840
Is it that obvious?

787
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,130
How did you know it was Senior Yoon?

788
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,010
We weren't together that much
after we started dating.

789
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,930
I could tell

790
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:16,980
from long ago.

791
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,860
I could see that you like her a lot.

792
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,320
I do.

793
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,720
Thanks anyway, I'll be careful.

794
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,530
You have to keep this a secret.

795
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,800
Don't tell Senior Yoon that you know.

796
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,150
Congratulations.

797
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,490
Thanks.

798
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:36,970
Cheers.

799
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,250
You'll be discharged today.

800
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,630
I'll text you the result
of your biopsy in a few days.

801
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,050
Can we get the results sooner?

802
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,590
It's the soonest you'll get.

803
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,380
By the way, when I actually saw it,

804
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,060
the shape and size weren't that bad.

805
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,310
You don't have to worry so much.

806
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:05,990
Thank you.

807
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,940
Oksu-dong, please.

808
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,650
Just go to Yongsan Station, please.

809
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,590
I'm going to Chuncheon.

810
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,460
It'll be hard for you to go alone.

811
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,550
How will you manage?

812
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:41,220
I feel more comfortable there.

813
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,790
I'm going to Chuncheon.

814
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,890
Mom.

815
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,170
Where should I go?

816
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,620
To Yongsan Station, please.

817
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:16,640
[Set me free, Mom.]

818
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,380
Whenever you're like this,

819
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,960
it's really hard for me.

820
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,060
[It's too much for me, Mom.]

821
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,610
Senior Yoon!

822
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,920
What do you think? Not bad, right?

823
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,690
Just wait. I'll make it better.

824
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,840
Let's do it together.

825
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,420
Okay.

826
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,760
Pull it.

827
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,800
Okay.

828
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,290
Should I stick it in here?

829
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:49,570
Yes, right there.

830
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,150
Ouch.

831
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,790
Be careful.

832
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,730
You're so silly.

833
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,630
Clean it up.

834
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,520
She's small but strong.

835
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,000
You really know how to do it?

836
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,070
It's my first time.

837
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,090
It's catching on.

838
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:21,910
Good job!

839
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,570
You're good at it.

840
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,050
Great job!

841
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,620
Again! Do it again.

842
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,360
Be careful.

843
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,920
-Stop fooling around.
-Ow! You stepped on my foot!

844
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,040
Sorry.

845
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,830
Do you feel better now?

846
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,210
How about the cold?

847
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,910
I'm good.

848
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,660
My mom will

849
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,430
be okay, right?

850
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,360
I shouldn't have gone too far.

851
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,950
I know it'll become a knot in her heart.

852
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,920
But it's strange though.

853
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,290
I can't help saying those things to her.

854
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,490
That I hate it.

855
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,220
That it's a burden.

856
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,720
That it's hard for me.

857
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,750
As a matter of fact,

858
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,190
no matter how hard I try,

859
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,860
I can't understand her.

860
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,090
Why is she so afraid of letting Dad go?

861
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,360
I thought I would get it.

862
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,290
I thought I would be able
to understand her

863
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:23,160
when I grew up and loved someone.

864
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,000
But I can't understand her.

865
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,790
Maybe it's because I'm determined.

866
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:40,900
Determined not to be like my mom.

867
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,390
That's why I'm like this.

868
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:56,960
I don't want to risk everything for love.

869
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,890
I don't want to be like my mom.

870
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,880
It's okay.

871
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,770
I'll be the one.

872
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,600
I'll risk everything for love.
