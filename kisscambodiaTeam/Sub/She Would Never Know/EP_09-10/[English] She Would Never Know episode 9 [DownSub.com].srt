00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,800
[All places, characters, firms and events
depicted in this show are fictitious.]

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,060
If I don't like this,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,000
does it make me a bad person?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,620
I can't ask if you need any help.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,720
We can't laugh together anymore.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,960
I can't even look at you in the eyes.

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,630
I don't like this.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,170
I'm a bad person, right?

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,690
Even so,

11
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,490
I'll just be the bad person.

12
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,450
So don't give up.

13
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,650
Don't become distant

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
from me.

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,530
Song-ah?

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,030
I'm coming.

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,200
Come in when you're ready, Hyun-seung.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,220
Okay!

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,690
Next, the selling points of
Pearlsation eyeshadow.

20
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,220
The combination of
shimmering pearl and glitters

21
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,530
creates a transparent sparkle
in our glossy eyeshadow.

22
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,400
Please emphasize that it has
a transparent sparkle.

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,270
I'll now talk about our target customers.

24
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,840
Customers who want to
make their eyes pop...

25
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,920
Let me do it.

26
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,550
Hey.

27
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,530
What I said earlier...

28
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,230
Right.

29
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,670
I won't misunderstand.

30
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,300
Huh?

31
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,010
You need time to get used
to the sudden distancing.

32
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,380
The feelings you told me

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,240
usually arise as people get to know
more about each other.

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,050
So you don't have to worry.

35
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,040
No.

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,050
So you think

37
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,750
I was just saying it because
things get awkward between us?

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
But that's not it.

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Actually, I'm not so sure either.

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,329
I don't know how far I want this to go.

41
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,420
But what's certain is that

42
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,980
I can't let you get far from me.

43
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,110
I can't bear it.

44
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,290
I'll do my best to figure it out.

45
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,290
So could you please

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
stop distancing yourself from me

47
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,630
and just stay where you are?

48
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,520
If it's not too late yet.

49
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,290
Sheesh.

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,100
[Episode 9]

51
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,520
Why did you reject him in the first place?

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,130
What if he says it's too late?

53
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,990
Where can you find a guy like him?

54
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,040
What's the direction of his house?

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,100
Why?

56
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,870
I want to give him a big bow.

57
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,380
Hey, get up. Bow and say thank you to him.

58
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,010
Stop that.

59
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,780
Sit down.

60
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,850
I know.

61
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,240
And I'm grateful to him.

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,890
How could I possibly not know that?

63
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,890
What?

64
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,390
What's making you uncertain then?

65
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,490
It's just...

66
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't know why I can't let him go.

67
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,070
Is it because he's been so nice to me
that I've become greedy?

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,800
Or is it because I've unreasonably

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,470
fell for him?

70
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,200
Hey.

71
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,070
Why would it be unreasonable?

72
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,110
He's so sincere.
It'd be unreasonable not to like him back.

73
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,980
Don't you agree?

74
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,400
It's hard to realize what's in your heart.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,350
But once you know it, it's a home run.

76
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,320
Straight to being certain.

77
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
You're not that far off.

78
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,950
So what should you do now?

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,080
Stop using your head
and trust your instincts.

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,960
The instinct that is bubbling
and boiling inside you.

81
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Focus solely on that.

82
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,010
Good morning.

83
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,440
Hi.

84
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,510
How was yesterday's training?

85
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,640
Good.

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,330
Nothing special happened?

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,880
No.

88
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,620
I'm going to the pantry.
Do you want some coffee?

89
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,820
No, thanks.

90
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,770
Coffee?

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,370
Yes.

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,070
Drink this then.

93
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,310
I'll make another one.

94
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,680
Thanks.

95
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,700
[Personnel Appointment: Lee Jae-shin]
[New Project Director]

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,290
Wow.

97
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300
Our BM Lee!

98
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,640
He got promoted to director right away.

99
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,890
When did they form this project team

100
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,380
behind my back?

101
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,410
You didn't know either?

102
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,350
No, I didn't.

103
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,750
If I'd known, I would've told you.

104
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Why? You want to go?

105
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,590
Isn't that obvious?

106
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,550
I'll have a bright future ahead if I join.

107
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,660
I'm annoyed as it is
for not getting promoted.

108
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,080
You'll get promoted this year
if there's no hiccup.

109
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,630
Do you know how hard you have to work
on new projects?

110
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,760
You'd lose all your hair
because of the pressure.

111
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,070
It'd also be hard to get good results.

112
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,500
If they'd asked me to go,

113
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,300
I would've said no.

114
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,940
Who would become our new BM though?

115
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,409
Peekaboo!

116
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,710
You all are working hard, right?

117
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,750
Wow, this spot gets the best light.

118
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,480
My orchid...

119
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,890
I should put it here.

120
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,790
Keep up the good work.

121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,820
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,790
You guys are top-notch.

123
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,300
Thank you, sir.

124
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Goodbye.

125
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,340
He's getting his hopes up big time.

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,170
If BM Seo becomes our new BM,

127
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,890
I'll jump into the new project
with my life.

128
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,080
Thank you, sir.

129
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,780
I'll work harder from now on.

130
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,780
What will you do
about KLAR's BM position?

131
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,450
Until the end of the year, BM Lee...

132
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,240
No.

133
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,690
Director Lee will manage
both teams at once

134
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,860
until we find a replacement.

135
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,630
We'll have to see if we should choose one
from the other BMs

136
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,030
or find a new BM.

137
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Come in.

138
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,700
Grandpa!

139
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,280
Congratulations, Director Lee.

140
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,510
Thanks.

141
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,380
Why are you here?

142
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,650
It's not even a big deal.

143
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,650
I came to see you, Grandpa.

144
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,620
I won't be able to see you

145
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,150
once we go on our honeymoon.

146
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,820
So I was wondering.

147
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,860
Can we go to your house for dinner?

148
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,230
We can celebrate Jae-shin's promotion too.

149
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,660
Is that okay, Grandpa?

150
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,310
Uncle, what's on your mind?

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,380
Huh? Nothing.

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,050
Did you pick something you like?

153
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,550
Are you still heartbroken
after being rejected?

154
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,650
I didn't get rejected.

155
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,620
Uncle,

156
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,630
there's no shame in getting rejected.

157
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,290
You can't expect everyone to like you.

158
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,800
But I really wasn't rejected.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,970
I think I have a little hope.

160
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,430
Hope is good.

161
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,760
But what's with that expression?

162
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,630
I'm scared it might turn out differently.

163
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm not certain yet.

164
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,680
But your feelings are, right?

165
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,480
You still like that auntie, don't you?

166
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,830
Just focus on your hope then.

167
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,750
Love is straightforward.

168
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,890
That's what suits you too.

169
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,190
Want me to teach you anything else?

170
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,030
No.

171
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,300
Buy this for me.

172
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,780
You want that?

173
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,840
You cute little squirt.

174
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,140
Sitting together like this

175
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,910
makes me feel that
we're really becoming a family.

176
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,980
Let's eat together whenever we have time

177
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,510
before we leave, Grandpa.

178
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,120
Would you like a drink, Grandpa?

179
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Yes.

180
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,390
Could I do that first?

181
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,650
I would like to pour you a glass.

182
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,870
Pour me a glass too, please.

183
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,730
From now on,

184
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,420
report directly to me
about the Europe Project.

185
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,660
What?

186
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,340
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

187
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't want to see
the same mistake again.

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,540
I'll make it to the top three
in the European market in five years.

189
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,140
I look forward to that.

190
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,770
Want something to drink?

191
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
No.

192
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,590
Wait just a second.

193
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,890
You did so well today.

194
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,390
Seemed like Grandpa was satisfied
with you too.

195
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,330
It's just the beginning.

196
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,800
Since he's given me a chance
to exert my competence,

197
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,330
I'll show him what I can do.

198
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,100
I've come all this way to do this.

199
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,740
I'm so lucky I fell in love with you.

200
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,180
Do your best to show all that you have.

201
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,080
That's what Grandpa expects too.

202
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,090
But you can't neglect me
while you do that.

203
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,790
Bear it in mind.

204
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,330
You don't have to be insecure anymore.

205
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,930
I promise.

206
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,900
I won't ever make you feel insecure again.

207
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,970
I wish our wedding day will come sooner.

208
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,380
I'd be so happy.

209
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,710
Hello.

210
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm Kim Min-seong
from the Pra Valley Team.

211
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,380
[Score Card: Marketability, feasibility,
distinctiveness, originality]

212
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,160
First of all, I'd like to thank the judges

213
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,300
for giving me the chance
to do this presentation.

214
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,340
The new product I'll introduce today

215
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,890
is a combination of eyeshadow and brush.

216
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,270
It's called Shadow Rush.

217
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,170
In the gripping part of the brush,

218
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,510
I put in powder eyeshadows.

219
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,250
When you press the top part,

220
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,870
the eyeshadow will come out
through the brush tip,

221
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,850
which you can apply directly to your eyes.

222
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,470
It's very innovative.

223
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,360
How do you feel?

224
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,530
Looking at this makes you
feel good, isn't it?

225
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,560
What if you can apply this on your face

226
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,660
right after washing it?

227
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,870
It's a gel-type cube formula
that won't freeze.

228
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,300
You can take out the essence, one by one,
from the freezer,

229
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,170
according to your skin condition.

230
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,380
It's called Good Morning Ice Cube Booster.

231
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,980
This gel-type cube formula
that won't freeze

232
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,580
is different from our existing products.

233
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,220
By rolling it onto your skin,

234
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,420
you can see a natural skin
layering effect as well.

235
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,390
[He must be so nervous.]

236
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,260
I wonder how he's doing.

237
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,960
It'd be great if he can win first place.

238
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,860
Of course.

239
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,360
Are you not worried, Song-ah?

240
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,260
He'll do well. He's already exceptional.

241
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,100
You helped him a lot, right?

242
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,000
You two usually take care of each other.

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,840
No.

244
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,140
This time, he did it by himself.

245
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,970
Himself?

246
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,240
Of course, it was all him.

247
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,450
Did you clear things out?

248
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,120
Did you come to the conclusion
that he's no good?

249
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,720
What?

250
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,820
He's young, so he's kind of slow, huh?

251
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,350
Wait.

252
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,620
You three are talking
about his presentation, right?

253
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Of course.

254
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,130
What else would it be?

255
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,790
Yes.

256
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,890
What's this?

257
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,960
When did the three of you
become so united?

258
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,560
-Since we joined the company.
-Right.

259
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,100
KL...

260
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,030
LA...

261
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,700
AR...

262
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,500
Whoo!

263
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,700
[KLAR Team, ABM Chae Hyun-seung]

264
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,240
Hello.

265
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,380
I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR Team.

266
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,160
Before I begin, may I know

267
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,220
if there's anyone who applied
mascara or eyeliner today?

268
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,950
Okay.

269
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,320
What's the most inconvenient thing
for you throughout the day?

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,260
My eye makeup smudges under my eyes.

271
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,460
Even though they're waterproof,

272
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,260
I look like a panda in the afternoon.

273
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,160
Right.

274
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,330
A lot of people will become a panda
like this at the end of the day.

275
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,570
I tried it myself,

276
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,770
and I was no exception.

277
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,280
There are a lot of
makeup correction products.

278
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,980
But one thing is lacking.

279
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,450
They can remove makeup

280
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,690
but they can't let you touch up makeup.

281
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,460
They also remove the eye cream
that you've applied in the morning.

282
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,710
So today,

283
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,790
I've brought this product.

284
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,890
Makeup Renew Stick.

285
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,730
We have eye cream on one side of the swab

286
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,600
and foundation on the other end.

287
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,060
It's a makeup correction stick.

288
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,400
Eye cream? Not cleanser?

289
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,500
It's eye cream.

290
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,610
Please look at the screen on your left.

291
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,150
It's a tip I learned from the store.

292
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Like this.

293
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,220
You can remove makeup
by simply using eye cream.

294
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,890
Can you see this?

295
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,530
You can protect the area around the eyes

296
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,830
without removing the foundation.

297
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,560
Run over like this

298
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,200
and tap it in. Then it's all done.

299
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,900
Now, you don't have to
carry around a heavy pouch.

300
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,210
All you need is this simple and easy
Makeup Renew Stick.

301
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,180
Also, it gives our existing customers

302
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,119
a chance to use our eye cream
and foundation,

303
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,980
thereby expanding their purchase.

304
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,420
This is the end of my presentation.

305
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Thank you.

306
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,540
We've prepared mushrooms

307
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,800
and chopped vegetables into pieces.

308
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,870
It's easy, right?

309
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,770
Yes.

310
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,410
Now, we'll clean the abalone
for the abalone rice.

311
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,080
The parboiled abalone...

312
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,450
Here, Chef.

313
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,080
Thank you.

314
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,630
Take the abalone in your left hand

315
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,620
and a spoon in your right.

316
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,290
You can remove it in one go.

317
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll show you.

318
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,460
Like this.

319
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,700
Easy, right?

320
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,070
Let's clean it now.

321
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,900
We'll use the intestines, so keep them.

322
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,870
Make a cut like a cross.

323
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,910
Shall we talk while waiting
for it to cook?

324
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,580
Is this really your first time
doing a cooking class?

325
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,520
-You're really good.
-Indeed.

326
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,150
She helped me a lot.

327
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,490
I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.

328
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,160
Thanks to you, we're enjoying
this valuable experience.

329
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,860
Please help promote his restaurant then.

330
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,140
No, that's okay.

331
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
It's doing well on its own,
so I humbly ask you not to.

332
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,070
I did well today, right?

333
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,130
Of course. Didn't you see their reaction?

334
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,210
I had fun too.

335
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,810
I was cooking,
but it didn't feel like work.

336
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
Thank you.

337
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,810
For the preparation and today's class.

338
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,220
When I set out to do something,
I do it well.

339
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,620
I actually like taking action.

340
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,590
I was always the class president in school

341
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,660
and student representative in college.

342
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,200
But I think I grew insecure
as I raised Ha-eun.

343
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,510
I'm worried that if I take action,

344
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,040
Ha-eun might suffer the repercussions.

345
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,340
It's still hard dealing with moms.

346
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,080
They're all older than me.

347
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,120
Then shall we do
the cooking class regularly?

348
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,590
Do you want to be the manager?

349
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,690
Manager?

350
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,420
Yes.

351
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,920
You'll gather people
and manage them like now.

352
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,600
Sometimes you can be my assistant too.

353
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
Why not?

354
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,230
I'm good at pushing things through.

355
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,070
Should I draw up a curriculum first?

356
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,070
Be careful.

357
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,840
Look.

358
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,240
Thank you. I almost fell.

359
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,350
Come this way.

360
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,890
Hyun-seung is back!

361
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,120
How did it go?

362
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
Oh, well...

363
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,230
It's...

364
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,930
It's okay. You did your best.

365
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,130
Good work.

366
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,700
Who won first place?

367
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,910
Oh, that.

368
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,780
I'm worried...

369
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,080
Did something happen?

370
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,150
Winning first place 3 years in a row is...

371
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,140
-It's hard. So hard.
-Of course, it's hard.

372
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,750
But four years in a row will be harder.

373
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,690
I feel so sorry for my junior.

374
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,020
Huh?

375
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,590
So you won first place?

376
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,660
Let's go out for beef BBQ.

377
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,760
You really won?

378
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
You won first place?

379
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,500
-Yes! First place!
-Great job!

380
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,700
Hyun-seung! You!

381
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,680
Congratulations!

382
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,570
We should go today.

383
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,680
Good job.

384
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,050
You did so well.

385
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,780
Congratulations!

386
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,920
-I told you I knew you'd win.
-We should go today.

387
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,180
I told you that time.

388
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,350
Thank you for helping us.

389
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,490
Please help yourself.

390
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,690
I hardly did anything.

391
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,260
Congratulations on winning second place.

392
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,660
You worked hard too, Min-seong.

393
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,170
I like your idea.

394
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,930
Right?

395
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,340
Our bosses have no insight.

396
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,640
I should sell my idea to our competitors.

397
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,570
Before you sell it to our competitors,

398
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,230
can you give it to me first?

399
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,550
I'd like to ask our manufacturers
to see if it's feasible.

400
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,880
Really? You're really interested?

401
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Of course.

402
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,620
Wow, Senior Yoon.

403
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
You're very perceptive!

404
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,390
I envy you, Hyun-seung.

405
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,280
My senior, Manager Jung,
is such a blockhead.

406
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,960
I don't want to talk about him.

407
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,030
Let's drink up.

408
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,030
Cheers.

409
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,740
-Good work.
-Good job.

410
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,380
By the way,

411
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,080
you don't have a boyfriend, right?

412
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,280
A boyfriend?

413
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,510
Yes. I have a friend.

414
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,320
He's really great.

415
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,000
Want to see a picture?

416
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,220
Here.

417
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,360
Take a look.

418
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,430
What do you think?

419
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,860
Handsome, right?

420
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,360
Yes, he is.

421
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Should I give him your number?

422
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
No! It's okay.

423
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,730
You don't like him?

424
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,470
The photo doesn't do him justice.

425
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,240
He's really handsome
if you meet him in person.

426
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,110
I'm not interested in blind dates
for the moment.

427
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,980
I have someone I'm concerned about.

428
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,320
But thanks anyway, I appreciate it.

429
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,220
That's too bad.

430
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,250
You two would be perfect for each other.

431
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,790
If you want a blind date, call me.

432
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,760
I know many great guys.

433
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,130
Hey, you've hardly eaten.

434
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,130
Try this.

435
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,300
It's so good.

436
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,470
Thank you.

437
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,630
This place is great.

438
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,510
Right?

439
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,140
I paid with Se-rim's credit card.

440
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,680
-Seriously.
-Don't worry.

441
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,750
Want to go for a cup of coffee?

442
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,850
Senior Yoon?

443
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,380
Let's do coffee some other time.

444
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,980
Why? You have other plans?

445
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,690
No, I'm just a bit tired.

446
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,150
Let's just get a quick cup of coffee.

447
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,490
We should do it next time.

448
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,850
I have to head home too.

449
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,760
Okay, then.

450
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,590
We'll be going this way.

451
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,630
Goodbye.

452
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,900
Goodbye.

453
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,800
Bye.

454
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,040
Are you not feeling well?

455
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,390
You didn't drink.

456
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm good.

457
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,710
Do you have to go home right away?

458
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,380
It's all thanks to you.

459
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,760
Thanks to your help,

460
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,760
I was able to get a good result.

461
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,260
Right.

462
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,820
I've won two years in a row.

463
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,130
I bet my guidance was excellent.

464
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,870
You are blessed with a great trainer.

465
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,810
You are blessed with a great trainee.

466
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,710
You're right.

467
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,910
Then...

468
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,850
Can you tell me I did a good job
one more time?

469
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,380
Good job.

470
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,120
Come on.

471
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,490
That's it?

472
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,460
Would you pat my head?

473
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,590
Since I got first place.

474
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,970
Good job.

475
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,080
Wait, I think you have a fever.

476
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,080
Come here.

477
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,140
You have a fever.

478
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,420
Let's go.

479
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,250
I think I'm fine though.

480
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,990
You have a high fever.

481
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,650
Let's go.

482
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,340
-I'm fine...
-Let's go.

483

[Closed for the time being
due to personal reasons]

484
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,910
It's two months' payment.

485
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,700
I think it'd be better for you
to find a job somewhere else.

486
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,570
I don't know if I'd be able
to reopen this place or not.

487
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,510
You're going to close the shop?

488
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,340
What's wrong?

489
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,420
You don't need to know.

490
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,060
Honey, try this.

491
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,390
I learned this from Chef Ryu today.

492
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,170
What do you think?

493
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,640
It's good.

494
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,110
Chef Ryu is really good.

495
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,310
He not only cooks well
but also speaks well.

496
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,380
All the moms in the group chat
are his fans now.

497
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,050
So...

498
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,190
I'm thinking about starting
an official cooking class.

499
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,120
Chef Ryu wants to do it too.

500
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,490
I think it'll be fun
if I become the manager.

501
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,930
I found the right job for me.

502
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,130
What do you think?

503
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,000
If you want to do it, you should.

504
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,440
Do whatever you want.

505
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,310
Do you still care about me?

506
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,020
Sometimes, I kind of wonder.

507
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,190
You seem indifferent
rather than being considerate.

508
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,460
Who else can I talk to
about things like this?

509
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,990
You're all I have.

510
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,490
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

511
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Forget it.

512
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,700
I should be the one to take you home.

513
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,340
It's okay.

514
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,610
Do you have medicine at home?

515
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,730
Probably.

516
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,440
I probably do.

517
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,250
I'll get you medicine before I leave,
just in case.

518
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,450
Go inside.

519
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,580
I'm really fine.

520
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,540
Hurry. Go inside.

521
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,820
Okay.

522
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,930

You said you'd be working late.

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,640
Here. I brought salad and a sandwich.

Are you busy?

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,130
No!

Yes.

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,230
But I'm regretting that now.

554
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,800
I think I'm not ready yet.

555
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,470
Not ready for what?

556
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,840
To be hated.

557
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,280
Until now, all my clients
liked my dresses.

558
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,980
But now, I'll be showing them to everyone.

559
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,320
Someone is going to say this.

560
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,020
Man, why is this dress so expensive?

561
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,490
It's not even that pretty.

562
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,090
What should I do
if I grab them by the collar?

563
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,660
Sometimes, I lose my temper.

564
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,090
Grab them, then.

565
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,130
I'll be responsible for the rest.

566
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,430
The settlement money
would be catastrophic.

567
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,930
I told you. I'm very capable.

568
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,400
You can cause all the trouble you want.

569
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,040
Just give me a pretext to deal with it.

570
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,290
Let's start with

571
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,310
being your boyfriend.

572
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,140
Start with?

573
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,580
For now.

574
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,290
By the way,

575
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,670
do you make men's suits?

576
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Normally, you'd have to wait for months.
But since I'm doing this now,

577
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
I'll have to overcharge you.

578
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,370
Sure.

579
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,240
Overcharge me all you want.

580
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,870
Put your arms up.

581
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,620
I guess I'm the only one trembling.

582
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,910
If you don't step back,

583
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,570
I'm going to do it.

584
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,110
Is this what you meant?

585
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,890
You're awake.

586
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,500
I just got up.

587
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,140
What about your fever?

588
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,770
Are you worried?

589
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,240
Of course, I did.

590
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,510
Take care of yourself.

591
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,880
You said I don't take care of myself,

592
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,880
but I think you're worse than me.

593
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,450
I'm so happy

594
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,630
to be scolded by you.

595
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,460
Take some medicine.

596
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,860
-I'll get it for you.
-Senior Yoon.

597
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,770
You can take your time.

598
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,100
But if you come to me,

599
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,640
I'll show you
the most beautiful love ever.

600
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,140
I'll go get your medicine.

601
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,860
Where have you been?

602
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Yikes!

603
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,100
Did you just come back?

604
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,960
No.

605
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,070
I took a walk.

606
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,070
Wearing like this?

607
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,640
Why? This is an appropriate outfit
for taking a walk.

608
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,610
Go to sleep. I'm going to bed.

609
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,730
Good morning.

610
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,410
How do you feel?

611
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,810
I'm totally fine.

612
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,180
Someone took real good care of me.

613
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,020
You didn't sleep much, right?

614
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,280
Are you tired?

615
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,720
Not at all.

616
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,220
That's good.

617
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,820
Let's have dinner if you're free tonight.

618
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,190
I owe you.

619
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,560
Sure.

620
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,570
[Director Lee Jae-shin]

621
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,530
Wow, your room looks better than mine.

622
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,200
Want to switch?

623
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Should I?

624
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,180
Forget it. Hyo-joo will raise hell.

625
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,990
You have plans?

626
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,320
I need to see the chairman.

627
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,490
I have something to report.

628
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Jae-shin.

629
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,430
I don't have to compete with you, right?

630
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,360
Why? You think you can't beat me?

631
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,630
Sheesh.

632
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,120
Why? Do I look like I've no confidence?

633
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,640
-Put it back on.
-Okay.

634
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,740
What do you think about BM Seo for KLAR?

635
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,570
BM Seo?

636
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,250
Based on career experience,
he's a safe bet.

637
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,450
He seems to want it too.

638
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,920
It's not an unreasonable choice.

639
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,090
Let's talk about it over drinks later.

640
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,120
I'll call you.

641
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,700
Let go! Lee Jae-shin is my son!

642
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,100
Go check it.

643
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,070
Stop talking nonsense.

644
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,230
Let go of me!

645
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Son!

646
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Jae-shin!

647
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,880
Son, I came here to see you...

648
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,710
I have no money to give you. Leave.

649
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,480
I found your mom.

650
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,680
My mom?

651
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,590
You know the Yu-mi Supermarket
in our old neighborhood?

652
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,030
Yu-mi's mother saw your mom.

653
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,210
Come with me to see her.

654
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,580
I don't have parents.

655
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,060
My so-called father took my money
and cut ties with me.

656
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,150
My so-called mother left me in that ditch.

657
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,450
She doesn't exist to me.

658
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,020
So stop visiting a stranger
and causing problems.

659
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,550
You bastard.

660
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,220
Bad parents are not even human, is it?

661
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,890
You marry into a rich family

662
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,220
and abandon your parents.

663
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,830
But you know,

664
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,250
no matter how hard you deny it,

665
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,630
you're still my son.

666
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,630
Got it?

667
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You can try all you want.

668
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,430
But those lofty fellows

669
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,970
won't treat you like one of them.

670
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,270
A lap dog.

671
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,610
You're a lap dog they'll exploit,
and then they'll throw you away.

672
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,280
Whose fault is it
that I'm living like a lap dog?

673
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,950
If it weren't for you two...

674
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,990
See?

675
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,480
All you do is blame your parents.

676
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,570
We're the sinners!

677
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,120
Forget it!

678
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,390
I don't need a son like you.

679
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,420
Good.

680
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,300
Stay out of my life then.

681
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,270
Please.

682
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,070
Let's see how well you live!

683
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,370
You're going to regret this!

684
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,430
This Mille-Feuille is much easier to make.

685
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,970
I'll prepare beef sticky rice
Mille-Feuille next time.

686
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,770
Okay. I'll notify the moms
in our group chat.

687
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,440
Alright.

688
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,910
Do you want a glass of beer? I'm thirsty.

689
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,870
What about your work at the restaurant?

690
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,980
It's just one glass.

691
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,880
-I'll have one then.
-Okay.

692
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,140
Be right back.

693
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,020
I forgot the bottle opener.

694
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,790
Hold on.

695
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,430
Huh? Where is it?

696
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,730
Just bring a spoon.

697
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,330
A spoon?

698
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,940
You know how to open it with this?

699
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,470
You don't?

700
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,080
Grab it like this.

701
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,490
I see why you were
a student representative.

702
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,720
That was loud.

703
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
I was shocked.

704
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,060
So refreshing.

705
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,360
One more glass?

706
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,700
Do you like to drink?

707
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,470
Not a lot.

708
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,420
But if there's someone to drink with,

709
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,970
I'll have a glass or two.

710
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,440
What about you?

711
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,340
Me too.

712
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,040
I just drink with Woo-hyun.

713
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,650
By the way...

714
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,750
What is it like drinking with him?

715
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,820
Boring, right?

716
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,380
He is kind of boring.

717
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,680
Right?

718
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,750
He doesn't respond to what I say.

719
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,890
Do you do all the talking too?

720
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,450
Anyway,

721
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,040
I know how he's like,

722
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,360
but sometimes I'm hurt.

723
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,030
I can't feel his affection
if he doesn't express it.

724
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,100
Seriously.

725
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,540
Oops.

726
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,240
I ran my mouth too much

727
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,370
in front of his friend.

728
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,780
Sorry.

729
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,810
I guess I feel at ease with you.

730
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,710
I'm certain

731
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,480
that he thinks the world of you.

732
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,320
You're very precious to him.

733
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
For sure.

734
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,160
I can see that.

735
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,130
Do you want to be real friends?

736
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,300
Let's be friends.

737
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,440
Rock, paper, scissors!

738
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,810
Rock, paper, scissors!

739
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:54,520
Rock, paper, scissors! Scissors!

740
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,150
We'll get going now.

741
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,640
-Okay, Bye.
-Bye. See you tomorrow.

742
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,610
-Bye, Ha-eun.
-Bye.

743
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,390
What does Jae-young like about you?

744
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,550
How can there be just one thing?

745
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,960
He probably likes everything about me.

746
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,430
It's not love if you only
like one thing about that person.

747
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,100
You really make me speechless.

748
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,150
Why were you so late?

749
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,470
Where's the car?

750
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,160
I had a glass of beer.

751
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,680
I made a friend today.

752
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,910
What kind of friend?

753
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,040
Just a friend.

754
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,080
Like your friends.

755
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,650
A friend I can eat and talk with.

756
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,690
Do you not have friends until now?

757
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,360
Why?

758
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,030
Because you seem really excited.

759
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,710
I like my friend

760
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,700
and what he says to me.

761
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,980
[Mom]

762
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,250
What is it?

763
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,280
[Sweetie, can I talk to you right now?]

764
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,490
What's the matter?

765
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,560
[What time are you coming?]

766
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,390
Where to?

767
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,690
[Your home.]

768
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,160
[You'll come back
right after work, right?]

769
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,260
You're in Seoul?

770
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,260
Yes.

771
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm cooking kimchi stew with pork
for you right now.

772
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,970
[If you come back right after work...]

773
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,240
[Wait. What time is it now?]

774
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,770
Huh? Right.

775
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,880
You'll come before 7 p.m., right?

776
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,410
You should've told me you were coming.

777
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,750
I have plans tonight.

778
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,550
I'm here already. Can't you cancel it?

779
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,020
It's an office gathering.

780
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,320
But I made all this.

781
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,860
Hey, why don't you skip it?

782
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,730
[Tell them your mom's home
and just slip out of it.]

783
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,760
[They can do the gathering without you.]

784
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,930
You'll skip it, right?

785
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,190
Hang up for now.

786
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm working.

787
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Okay, then on your way home...

788
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,110
You heartless girl.

789
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,720
That jerk.

790
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,620
Disrespecting the person who raised him...

791
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,460
What is it?

792
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,670
Lee Se-dong, this is the police.
Open the door.

793
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:32,480
We know you're inside. Open up.

794
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Seriously.

795
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,850
Lee Se-dong!

796
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,570
I got the keys.

797
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,550
Get him!

798
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:17,750
Hey! Stop right there!

799
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,050
Hey, Lee Se-dong!

800
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,230
Hey!

801
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,900
See?

802
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,300
You can get out of the gathering.

803
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,870
They're just going to drink anyway.

804
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,040
Why would you go?

805
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,840
It's better to eat at home with your mom.

806
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,080
Are you done already?

807
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,820
How long are you staying?

808
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,060
I just came today.

809
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,180
I'm going to stay for a while.

810
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,360
What about the shop?

811
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,920
I put up a memo that I'm closing shop
for a while.

812
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,960
What are you doing this weekend?

813
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,770
Want to go shopping with me?

814
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,770
No. How about taking a few days off?

815
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,440
Let's go to Jeju Island.

816
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,070
I heard it's great this time of year.

817
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,040
Just stay until this weekend.

818
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,350
It's not good to close the shop that long.

819
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,010
I'm going to bed.

820
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,790
No, stay and talk with me for a while.

821
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,150
You'll take time off work, right?

822
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,620
I'm not a free-timer. I have a job.

823
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,660
I can't drop everything
just because of you.

824
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,760
Don't you know that?

825
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,360
Come on.

826
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,500
Of course, I know.

827
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,670
But if you have your reasons,
you can take time off.

828
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,360
When I suggest something,

829
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,910
you never just agree to do it.

830
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,430
-What about you?
-What about me?

831
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,580
You never think about me at all.

832
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Even today.

833
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,320
You barged in here
knowing I have a roommate.

834
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,010
You forced me to cancel my plans.

835
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:01,260
It's Ga-young.
She's an old friend, so it's okay.

836
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,700
Are you that upset about missing out?

837
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,130
You didn't even ask why I've come.

838
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,520
Be honest.

839
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,470
You were going to meet
a guy tonight, right?

840
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,040
Do you have a boyfriend?

841
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,080
What if I do?

842
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,510
Really? You really have a boyfriend?

843
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,650
What does he do?

844
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,180
No, forget it.

845
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:29,950
Stop seeing him.

846
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,850
Break up with him.

847
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,320
No man for you.

848
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
No.

849
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,630
I'm dying.

850
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,470
It's cancer.

851
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,710
Yes.

852
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,080
Oh, really?

853
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,080
Thank you.

854
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,960
I'll call you back.

855
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,420
Okay.

856
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,730
I asked a doctor I know.

857
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,760
She said there's only
a small chance of cancer.

858
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,610
Get the surgery.

859
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,480
So that you can get a biopsy.

860
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,700
I'll set up an appointment tomorrow.

861
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,380
I don't want to get surgery.

862
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:29,980
What then?

863
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,520
It's a small chance,
but it can still be cancer.

864
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,060
Then what are you going to do?

865
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,950
What if it turns out to be cancer?

866
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,560
Are you just going to die then?

867
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,690
How could you talk about death so easily?

868
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,960
Are you not worried
that I might have cancer?

869
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,030
That's why I'm telling you to get surgery.

870
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,900
That's what you should do.

871
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,580
What if I don't wake up
from the anesthesia?

872
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,410
If only your father were alive,

873
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,880
he would've been so worried about me.

874
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,040
Unlike my daughter

875
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,020
who is acting like it doesn't concern her.

876
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,850
Don't get surgery then.

877
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,590
And don't complain to me when it hurts.

878
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,360
How could you?

879
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,760
I'm bothersome to you, is it?

880
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,030
If I get cancer,
it'll be troublesome for you.

881
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,490
So you want me to get surgery
and get rid of me, is it?

882
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,070
Spit it out.

883
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,670
What did I do to you that was so wrong?

884
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,080
Right.

885
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,390
After your father passed away,

886
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,180
it was so hard for me
that I was dependent on you.

887
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,650
Is that a sin?

888
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:48,020
You've abandoned me
to live your life in Seoul now!

889
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,260
You're dating too,
which I told you not to!

890
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,300
Are you going to marry that guy?

891
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,330
Well, are you?

892
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,300
Are you going to discard me completely?

893
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,570
How long are you going to do this?

894
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,370
What now?

895
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,940
You knew Dad was having an affair!

896
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,410
You knew. And I did too.

897
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,420
What do you mean?

898
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,420
Dad didn't have an affair.

899
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,250
Stop talking nonsense.

900
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,930
If you're going to hate someone,
just hate me then.

901
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,560
Why are you pretending not to know?

902
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,730
Can't you believe that Dad betrayed you?

903
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,800
Or is that the only way to torment me?

904
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,840
Huh?

905
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,210
Do you know what was
really horrible for me?

906
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,980
I know what kind of person Dad was.

907
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,880
I know that you know too.

908
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,450
But when you bound me to your side,

909
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,350
you kept talking about Dad.

910
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,290
If only Dad were here...

911
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,090
Like Dad. Instead of Dad. Dad!

912
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,960
Why can't you break away from him?

913
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,600
Why do you keep tormenting me?

914
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,770
Why did you have to
drag everything out like this?

915
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,830
Huh?

916
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,040
When did you know?

917
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,380
Why didn't you tell me?

918
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,380
You pretended not to know,
like what you're doing now.

919
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,480
How can I tell you anything then?

920
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,150
Still, you should've told me.

921
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,290
You're making me a fool.

922
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,190
Unbelievable.

923
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,050
I'm home.

924
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,020
[Yoon Song-ah]

925
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,560
Here to see your dad?

926
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,690
Yes.

927
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,360
Don't run, kids!

928
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,440
Dad!

929
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,400
Honey, I'm home!

930
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,890
-Where's Song-ah?
-In her room.

931
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,510
Song-ah, Dad's home!

932
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,210
Sweetie, I'm home.

933
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,830
I'm opening the door.

934
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,150
Song-ah.

935
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,250
She's already asleep.

936
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,620
You must be hungry.

937
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,430
I'm home.

938
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,510
[I went to give Dad some sandwiches.]

939
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,720
Mom!

940
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,460
Huh?

941
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,600
Hi, Sweetie.

942
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,230
Why are you here?

943
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,450
Are you alright?

944
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,240
Me?

945
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,370
Of course, I'm alright. Why wouldn't I be?

946
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,580
I can't seem to find your dad.

947
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:11,780
I'll tell him to eat this
for a late-night snack.

948
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,150
Let's go, Sweetie.

949
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,430
Senior Yoon.

950
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,770
Hyun-seung.

951
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,510
What brings you here at this hour?

952
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,340
Just...

953
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,650
I wanted to eat ice cream.

954
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,210
And you popped into my head.

955
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,060
Something happened, right?

956
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,430
Were you crying?

957
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,050
Why would I cry?

958
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,500
There's nothing to cry about.

959
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,540
If it's okay for you,
let's go out for ice cream...

960
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,020
Starting from this moment,

961
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,100
I can't hear anything.

962
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,280
No one can see you.

963
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,840
So,

964
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,200
you can cry here.

965
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,430
Want to go for ice cream?

966
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:15,200
I like you.

967
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,440
I like you too.
