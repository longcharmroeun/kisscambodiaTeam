1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,800
ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,060
If I don't like this,

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,000
does it make me a bad person?

4
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,620
I can't ask if you need any help.

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,720
We can't laugh together anymore.

6
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,960
I can't even look at you in the eyes.

7
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,630
I don't like this.

8
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,170
I'm a bad person, right?

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,690
Even so,

10
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,490
I'll just be the bad person.

11
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,450
So don't give up.

12
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,650
Don't become distant

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
from me.

14
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,530
Song-ah?

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,030
I'm coming.

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,200
Come in when you're ready, Hyun-seung.

17
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,220
Okay!

18
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,690
Next, the selling points of
Pearlsation eyeshadow.

19
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,220
The combination of
shimmering pearl and glitters

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,530
creates a transparent sparkle
in our glossy eyeshadow.

21
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,400
Please emphasize that it has
a transparent sparkle.

22
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,270
I'll now talk about our target customers.

23
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,840
Customers who want to
make their eyes pop...

24
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,920
Let me do it.

25
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,550
Hey.

26
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,530
What I said earlier...

27
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,230
Right.

28
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,670
I won't misunderstand.

29
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,300
Huh?

30
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,010
You need time to get used
to the sudden distancing.

31
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,380
The feelings you told me

32
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,240
usually arise as people get to know
more about each other.

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,050
So you don't have to worry.

34
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,040
No.

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,050
So you think

36
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,750
I was just saying it because
things get awkward between us?

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
But that's not it.

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Actually, I'm not so sure either.

39
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,329
I don't know how far I want this to go.

40
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,420
But what's certain is that

41
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,980
I can't let you get far from me.

42
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,110
I can't bear it.

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,290
I'll do my best to figure it out.

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,290
So could you please

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,560
stop distancing yourself from me

46
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,630
and just stay where you are?

47
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,520
If it's not too late yet.

48
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,290
Sheesh.

49
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,000
{\an8}EPISODE 9

50
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,520
Why did you reject him in the first place?

51
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,130
What if he says it's too late?

52
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,990
Where can you find a guy like him?

53
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,040
What's the direction of his house?

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,100
Why?

55
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,870
I want to give him a big bow.

56
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,380
Hey, get up. Bow and say thank you to him.

57
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,010
Stop that.

58
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,780
Sit down.

59
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,850
I know.

60
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,240
And I'm grateful to him.

61
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,890
How could I possibly not know that?

62
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,890
What?

63
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,390
What's making you uncertain then?

64
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,490
It's just...

65
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,800
I don't know why I can't let him go.

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,070
Is it because he's been so nice to me
that I've become greedy?

67
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,800
Or is it because I've unreasonably

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,470
fell for him?

69
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,200
Hey.

70
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,070
Why would it be unreasonable?

71
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,110
He's so sincere.
It'd be unreasonable not to like him back.

72
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,980
Don't you agree?

73
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,400
It's hard to realize what's in your heart.

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,350
But once you know it, it's a home run.

75
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,320
Straight to being certain.

76
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
You're not that far off.

77
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,950
So what should you do now?

78
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,080
Stop using your head
and trust your instincts.

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,960
The instinct that is bubbling
and boiling inside you.

80
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Focus solely on that.

81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,010
Good morning.

82
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,440
Hi.

83
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,510
How was yesterday's training?

84
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,640
Good.

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,330
Nothing special happened?

86
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
No.

87
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm going to the pantry.
Do you want some coffee?

88
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
No, thanks.

89
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,770
Coffee?

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,370
Yes.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,070
Drink this then.

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,310
I'll make another one.

93
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,680
Thanks.

94
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
{\an8}PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT: LEE JAE-SHIN
NEW PROJECT DIRECTOR

95
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,290
Wow.

96
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,300
Our BM Lee!

97
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,640
He got promoted to director right away.

98
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,890
When did they form this project team

99
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,380
behind my back?

100
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,410
You didn't know either?

101
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,350
No, I didn't.

102
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,750
If I'd known, I would've told you.

103
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Why? You want to go?

104
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,590
Isn't that obvious?

105
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,550
I'll have a bright future ahead if I join.

106
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,660
I'm annoyed as it is
for not getting promoted.

107
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,080
You'll get promoted this year
if there's no hiccup.

108
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,630
Do you know how hard you have to work
on new projects?

109
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,760
You'd lose all your hair
because of the pressure.

110
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,070
It'd also be hard to get good results.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,500
If they'd asked me to go,

112
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,300
I would've said no.

113
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,940
Who would become our new BM though?

114
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,409
Peekaboo!

115
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,710
You all are working hard, right?

116
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,750
Wow, this spot gets the best light.

117
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,480
My orchid...

118
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,890
I should put it here.

119
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,790
Keep up the good work.

120
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,820
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,790
You guys are top-notch.

122
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,300
Thank you, sir.

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Goodbye.

124
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,340
He's getting his hopes up big time.

125
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,170
If BM Seo becomes our new BM,

126
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,890
I'll jump into the new project
with my life.

127
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,080
Thank you, sir.

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,780
I'll work harder from now on.

129
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,780
What will you do
about KLAR's BM position?

130
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,450
Until the end of the year, BM Lee...

131
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,240
No.

132
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,690
Director Lee will manage
both teams at once

133
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,860
until we find a replacement.

134
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,630
We'll have to see if we should choose one
from the other BMs

135
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,030
or find a new BM.

136
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Come in.

137
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:51,700
Grandpa!

138
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,280
Congratulations, Director Lee.

139
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,510
Thanks.

140
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,380
Why are you here?

141
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,650
It's not even a big deal.

142
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,650
I came to see you, Grandpa.

143
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,620
I won't be able to see you

144
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,150
once we go on our honeymoon.

145
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,820
So I was wondering.

146
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,860
Can we go to your house for dinner?

147
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,230
We can celebrate Jae-shin's promotion too.

148
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,660
Is that okay, Grandpa?

149
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,310
Uncle, what's on your mind?

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,380
Huh? Nothing.

151
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,050
Did you pick something you like?

152
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,550
Are you still heartbroken
after being rejected?

153
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,650
I didn't get rejected.

154
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,620
Uncle,

155
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,630
there's no shame in getting rejected.

156
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,290
You can't expect everyone to like you.

157
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,800
But I really wasn't rejected.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,970
I think I have a little hope.

159
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,430
Hope is good.

160
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,760
But what's with that expression?

161
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,630
I'm scared it might turn out differently.

162
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm not certain yet.

163
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,680
But your feelings are, right?

164
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,480
You still like that auntie, don't you?

165
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,830
Just focus on your hope then.

166
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,750
Love is straightforward.

167
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,890
That's what suits you too.

168
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,190
Want me to teach you anything else?

169
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,030
No.

170
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,300
Buy this for me.

171
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,780
You want that?

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,840
You cute little squirt.

173
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,140
Sitting together like this

174
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,910
makes me feel that
we're really becoming a family.

175
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,980
Let's eat together whenever we have time

176
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,510
before we leave, Grandpa.

177
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,120
Would you like a drink, Grandpa?

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,920
Yes.

179
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,390
Could I do that first?

180
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,650
I would like to pour you a glass.

181
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,870
Pour me a glass too, please.

182
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,730
From now on,

183
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,420
report directly to me
about the Europe Project.

184
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,660
What?

185
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,340
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

186
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,200
I don't want to see
the same mistake again.

187
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,540
I'll make it to the top three
in the European market in five years.

188
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,140
I look forward to that.

189
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,770
Want something to drink?

190
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
No.

191
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,590
Wait just a second.

192
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,890
You did so well today.

193
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,390
Seemed like Grandpa was satisfied
with you too.

194
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,330
It's just the beginning.

195
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,800
Since he's given me a chance
to exert my competence,

196
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,330
I'll show him what I can do.

197
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,100
I've come all this way to do this.

198
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,740
I'm so lucky I fell in love with you.

199
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,180
Do your best to show all that you have.

200
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,080
That's what Grandpa expects too.

201
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,090
But you can't neglect me
while you do that.

202
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,790
Bear it in mind.

203
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,330
You don't have to be insecure anymore.

204
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,930
I promise.

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,900
I won't ever make you feel insecure again.

206
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,970
I wish our wedding day will come sooner.

207
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,380
I'd be so happy.

208
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,710
Hello.

209
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm Kim Min-seong
from the Pra Valley Team.

210
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,380
{\an8}SCORE CARD: MARKETABILITY, FEASIBILITY,
DISTINCTIVENESS, ORIGINALITY

211
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,160
First of all, I'd like to thank the judges

212
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,300
for giving me the chance
to do this presentation.

213
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,340
The new product I'll introduce today

214
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,890
is a combination of eyeshadow and brush.

215
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,270
It's called Shadow Rush.

216
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,170
In the gripping part of the brush,

217
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,510
I put in powder eyeshadows.

218
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,250
When you press the top part,

219
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,870
the eyeshadow will come out
through the brush tip,

220
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,850
which you can apply directly to your eyes.

221
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,470
It's very innovative.

222
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,360
How do you feel?

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,530
Looking at this makes you
feel good, isn't it?

224
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,560
What if you can apply this on your face

225
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,660
right after washing it?

226
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,870
It's a gel-type cube formula
that won't freeze.

227
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,300
You can take out the essence, one by one,
from the freezer,

228
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,170
according to your skin condition.

229
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,380
It's called Good Morning Ice Cube Booster.

230
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,980
This gel-type cube formula
that won't freeze

231
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,580
is different from our existing products.

232
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,220
By rolling it onto your skin,

233
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,420
you can see a natural skin
layering effect as well.

234
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,390
<i>He must be so nervous.</i>

235
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,260
I wonder how he's doing.

236
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,960
It'd be great if he can win first place.

237
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,860
Of course.

238
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,360
Are you not worried, Song-ah?

239
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,260
He'll do well. He's already exceptional.

240
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,100
You helped him a lot, right?

241
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,000
You two usually take care of each other.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
No.

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,140
This time, he did it by himself.

244
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,970
Himself?

245
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,240
Of course, it was all him.

246
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,450
Did you clear things out?

247
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,120
Did you come to the conclusion
that he's no good?

248
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,720
What?

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,820
He's young, so he's kind of slow, huh?

250
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,350
Wait.

251
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,620
You three are talking
about his presentation, right?

252
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
Of course.

253
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,130
What else would it be?

254
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:20,790
Yes.

255
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,890
What's this?

256
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,960
When did the three of you
become so united?

257
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,560
-Since we joined the company.
-Right.

258
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,100
KL...

259
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,030
LA...

260
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,700
AR...

261
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,500
Whoo!

262
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,700
KLAR TEAM, ABM CHAE HYUN-SEUNG

263
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,240
Hello.

264
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,380
I'm Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR Team.

265
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,160
Before I begin, may I know

266
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,220
if there's anyone who applied
mascara or eyeliner today?

267
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,950
Okay.

268
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,320
What's the most inconvenient thing
for you throughout the day?

269
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,260
My eye makeup smudges under my eyes.

270
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,460
Even though they're waterproof,

271
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,260
I look like a panda in the afternoon.

272
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,160
Right.

273
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,330
A lot of people will become a panda
like this at the end of the day.

274
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,570
I tried it myself,

275
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,770
and I was no exception.

276
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,280
There are a lot of
makeup correction products.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,980
But one thing is lacking.

278
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,450
They can remove makeup

279
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,690
but they can't let you touch up makeup.

280
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,460
They also remove the eye cream
that you've applied in the morning.

281
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,710
So today,

282
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,790
I've brought this product.

283
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,890
Makeup Renew Stick.

284
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,730
We have eye cream on one side of the swab

285
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,600
and foundation on the other end.

286
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,060
It's a makeup correction stick.

287
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,400
Eye cream? Not cleanser?

288
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,500
It's eye cream.

289
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,610
Please look at the screen on your left.

290
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,150
It's a tip I learned from the store.

291
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Like this.

292
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,220
You can remove makeup
by simply using eye cream.

293
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,890
Can you see this?

294
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,530
You can protect the area around the eyes

295
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,830
without removing the foundation.

296
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,560
Run over like this

297
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,200
and tap it in. Then it's all done.

298
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,900
Now, you don't have to
carry around a heavy pouch.

299
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,210
All you need is this simple and easy
Makeup Renew Stick.

300
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,180
Also, it gives our existing customers

301
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,119
a chance to use our eye cream
and foundation,

302
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,980
thereby expanding their purchase.

303
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,420
This is the end of my presentation.

304
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Thank you.

305
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,540
We've prepared mushrooms

306
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,800
and chopped vegetables into pieces.

307
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,870
It's easy, right?

308
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,770
Yes.

309
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,410
Now, we'll clean the abalone
for the abalone rice.

310
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,080
The parboiled abalone...

311
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,450
Here, Chef.

312
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
Thank you.

313
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,630
Take the abalone in your left hand

314
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,620
and a spoon in your right.

315
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,290
You can remove it in one go.

316
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,400
I'll show you.

317
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,460
Like this.

318
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,700
Easy, right?

319
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,070
Let's clean it now.

320
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
We'll use the intestines, so keep them.

321
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,870
Make a cut like a cross.

322
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,910
Shall we talk while waiting
for it to cook?

323
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,580
Is this really your first time
doing a cooking class?

324
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,520
-You're really good.
-Indeed.

325
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,150
She helped me a lot.

326
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,490
I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.

327
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,160
Thanks to you, we're enjoying
this valuable experience.

328
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,860
Please help promote his restaurant then.

329
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,140
No, that's okay.

330
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,560
It's doing well on its own,
so I humbly ask you not to.

331
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,070
I did well today, right?

332
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,130
Of course. Didn't you see their reaction?

333
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,210
I had fun too.

334
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,810
I was cooking,
but it didn't feel like work.

335
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,680
Thank you.

336
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,810
For the preparation and today's class.

337
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,220
When I set out to do something,
I do it well.

338
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,620
I actually like taking action.

339
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,590
I was always the class president in school

340
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,660
and student representative in college.

341
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,200
But I think I grew insecure
as I raised Ha-eun.

342
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,510
I'm worried that if I take action,

343
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,040
Ha-eun might suffer the repercussions.

344
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,340
It's still hard dealing with moms.

345
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,080
They're all older than me.

346
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Then shall we do
the cooking class regularly?

347
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,590
Do you want to be the manager?

348
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,690
Manager?

349
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,420
Yes.

350
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,920
You'll gather people
and manage them like now.

351
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,600
Sometimes you can be my assistant too.

352
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Why not?

353
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,230
I'm good at pushing things through.

354
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,070
Should I draw up a curriculum first?

355
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,070
Be careful.

356
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,840
Look.

357
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,240
Thank you. I almost fell.

358
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,350
Come this way.

359
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,890
Hyun-seung is back!

360
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,120
How did it go?

361
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
Oh, well...

362
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,230
It's...

363
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,930
It's okay. You did your best.

364
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,130
Good work.

365
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,700
Who won first place?

366
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,910
Oh, that.

367
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,780
I'm worried...

368
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,080
Did something happen?

369
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,150
Winning first place 3 years in a row is...

370
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,140
-It's hard. So hard.
-Of course, it's hard.

371
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,750
But four years in a row will be harder.

372
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,690
I feel so sorry for my junior.

373
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,020
Huh?

374
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,590
So you won first place?

375
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,660
Let's go out for beef BBQ.

376
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,760
You really won?

377
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
You won first place?

378
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,500
-Yes! First place!
-Great job!

379
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,700
Hyun-seung! You!

380
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,680
Congratulations!

381
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,570
We should go today.

382
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,680
Good job.

383
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,050
You did so well.

384
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,780
Congratulations!

385
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,920
-I told you I knew you'd win.
-We should go today.

386
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,180
I told you that time.

387
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,350
Thank you for helping us.

388
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,490
Please help yourself.

389
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,690
I hardly did anything.

390
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,260
Congratulations on winning second place.

391
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,660
You worked hard too, Min-seong.

392
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,170
I like your idea.

393
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,930
Right?

394
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,340
Our bosses have no insight.

395
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,640
I should sell my idea to our competitors.

396
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,570
Before you sell it to our competitors,

397
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,230
can you give it to me first?

398
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,550
I'd like to ask our manufacturers
to see if it's feasible.

399
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,880
Really? You're really interested?

400
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Of course.

401
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,620
Wow, Senior Yoon.

402
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
You're very perceptive!

403
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,390
I envy you, Hyun-seung.

404
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,280
My senior, Manager Jung,
is such a blockhead.

405
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,960
I don't want to talk about him.

406
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,030
Let's drink up.

407
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,030
Cheers.

408
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,740
-Good work.
-Good job.

409
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,380
By the way,

410
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,080
you don't have a boyfriend, right?

411
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,280
A boyfriend?

412
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,510
Yes. I have a friend.

413
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,320
He's really great.

414
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
Want to see a picture?

415
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,220
Here.

416
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,360
Take a look.

417
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,430
What do you think?

418
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,860
Handsome, right?

419
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,360
Yes, he is.

420
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Should I give him your number?

421
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
No! It's okay.

422
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,730
You don't like him?

423
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,470
The photo doesn't do him justice.

424
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,240
He's really handsome
if you meet him in person.

425
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,110
I'm not interested in blind dates
for the moment.

426
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,980
I have someone I'm concerned about.

427
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,320
But thanks anyway, I appreciate it.

428
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,220
That's too bad.

429
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,250
You two would be perfect for each other.

430
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,790
If you want a blind date, call me.

431
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,760
I know many great guys.

432
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,130
Hey, you've hardly eaten.

433
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,130
Try this.

434
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,300
It's so good.

435
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,470
Thank you.

436
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,630
This place is great.

437
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,510
Right?

438
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,140
I paid with Se-rim's credit card.

439
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,680
-Seriously.
-Don't worry.

440
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,750
Want to go for a cup of coffee?

441
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,850
Senior Yoon?

442
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,380
Let's do coffee some other time.

443
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,980
Why? You have other plans?

444
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,690
No, I'm just a bit tired.

445
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,150
Let's just get a quick cup of coffee.

446
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,490
We should do it next time.

447
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,850
I have to head home too.

448
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,760
Okay, then.

449
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,590
We'll be going this way.

450
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,630
Goodbye.

451
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,900
Goodbye.

452
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,800
Bye.

453
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,040
Are you not feeling well?

454
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,390
You didn't drink.

455
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,370
I'm good.

456
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,710
Do you have to go home right away?

457
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,380
It's all thanks to you.

458
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,760
Thanks to your help,

459
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,760
I was able to get a good result.

460
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,260
Right.

461
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,820
I've won two years in a row.

462
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,130
I bet my guidance was excellent.

463
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,870
You are blessed with a great trainer.

464
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,810
You are blessed with a great trainee.

465
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,710
You're right.

466
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,910
Then...

467
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,850
Can you tell me I did a good job
one more time?

468
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,380
Good job.

469
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,120
Come on.

470
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,490
That's it?

471
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,460
Would you pat my head?

472
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,590
Since I got first place.

473
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,970
Good job.

474
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,080
Wait, I think you have a fever.

475
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,080
Come here.

476
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,140
You have a fever.

477
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,420
Let's go.

478
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,250
I think I'm fine though.

479
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,990
You have a high fever.

480
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,650
Let's go.

481
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,340
-I'm fine...
-Let's go.

482
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,630
CLOSED FOR THE TIME BEING
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

483
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,910
It's two months' payment.

484
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,700
I think it'd be better for you
to find a job somewhere else.

485
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,570
I don't know if I'd be able
to reopen this place or not.

486
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,510
You're going to close the shop?

487
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,340
What's wrong?

488
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,420
You don't need to know.

489
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,060
Honey, try this.

490
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,390
I learned this from Chef Ryu today.

491
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,170
What do you think?

492
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,640
It's good.

493
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,110
Chef Ryu is really good.

494
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,310
He not only cooks well
but also speaks well.

495
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,380
All the moms in the group chat
are his fans now.

496
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,050
So...

497
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,190
I'm thinking about starting
an official cooking class.

498
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,120
Chef Ryu wants to do it too.

499
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,490
I think it'll be fun
if I become the manager.

500
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,930
I found the right job for me.

501
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,130
What do you think?

502
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,000
If you want to do it, you should.

503
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,440
Do whatever you want.

504
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,310
Do you still care about me?

505
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,020
Sometimes, I kind of wonder.

506
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,190
You seem indifferent
rather than being considerate.

507
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,460
Who else can I talk to
about things like this?

508
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,990
You're all I have.

509
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,490
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

510
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Forget it.

511
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,700
I should be the one to take you home.

512
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,340
It's okay.

513
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,610
Do you have medicine at home?

514
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,730
Probably.

515
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,440
I probably do.

516
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,250
I'll get you medicine before I leave,
just in case.

517
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,450
Go inside.

518
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,580
I'm really fine.

519
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,540
Hurry. Go inside.

520
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,820
Okay.

521
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,930
Here.

522
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,450
-Thank you.
-Sure.

523
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,710
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>

524
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,750
<i>The password to my house is my birthday.</i>

525
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,350
Is it this?

526
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,060
PULL THE HANDLE

527
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,050
Don't be sick.

528
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
It makes me sad.

529
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,600
{\an8}LEE JAE-WOON

530
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,760
<i>Will you step outside for a while?</i>

531
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,140
What brings you here?

532
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,430
You said you'd be working late.

533
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,640
Here. I brought salad and a sandwich.

534
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,480
So you won't feel too burdened.

535
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,010
And also,

536
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,780
this.

537
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,020
I was passing by and it's so pretty.

538
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,120
Go ahead and work.

539
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,160
I won't bother you.

540
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,530
Are you busy?

541
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,130
No!

542
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,130
I'm going to take a break.

543
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
Come in.

544
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,240
There's nothing much to see.

545
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,310
No, there's a lot.

546
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,250
So...

547
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,320
You're working on this now?

548
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Yes.

549
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,430
I'm preparing for a pop-up store
in a department store.

550
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,990
I'm curious if I'm going the right way.

551
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,130
So I want to step out
in front of a lot of people.

552
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,230
But I'm regretting that now.

553
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,800
I think I'm not ready yet.

554
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,470
Not ready for what?

555
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,840
To be hated.

556
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,280
Until now, all my clients
liked my dresses.

557
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,980
But now, I'll be showing them to everyone.

558
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,320
Someone is going to say this.

559
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,020
Man, why is this dress so expensive?

560
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,490
It's not even that pretty.

561
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,090
What should I do
if I grab them by the collar?

562
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,660
Sometimes, I lose my temper.

563
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,090
Grab them, then.

564
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,130
I'll be responsible for the rest.

565
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,430
The settlement money
would be catastrophic.

566
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,930
I told you. I'm very capable.

567
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,400
You can cause all the trouble you want.

568
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,040
Just give me a pretext to deal with it.

569
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,290
Let's start with

570
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,310
being your boyfriend.

571
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,140
Start with?

572
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,580
For now.

573
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,290
By the way,

574
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,670
do you make men's suits?

575
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Normally, you'd have to wait for months.
But since I'm doing this now,

576
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
I'll have to overcharge you.

577
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,370
Sure.

578
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,240
Overcharge me all you want.

579
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,870
Put your arms up.

580
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,620
I guess I'm the only one trembling.

581
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,910
If you don't step back,

582
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,570
I'm going to do it.

583
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,110
Is this what you meant?

584
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,890
You're awake.

585
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,500
I just got up.

586
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,140
What about your fever?

587
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,770
Are you worried?

588
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,240
Of course, I did.

589
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,510
Take care of yourself.

590
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,880
You said I don't take care of myself,

591
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,880
but I think you're worse than me.

592
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,450
I'm so happy

593
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,630
to be scolded by you.

594
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,460
Take some medicine.

595
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,860
-I'll get it for you.
-Senior Yoon.

596
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,770
You can take your time.

597
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,100
But if you come to me,

598
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,640
I'll show you
the most beautiful love ever.

599
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,140
I'll go get your medicine.

600
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,860
Where have you been?

601
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Yikes!

602
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,100
Did you just come back?

603
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,960
No.

604
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,070
I took a walk.

605
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,070
Wearing like this?

606
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,640
Why? This is an appropriate outfit
for taking a walk.

607
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,610
Go to sleep. I'm going to bed.

608
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,730
Good morning.

609
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,410
How do you feel?

610
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,810
I'm totally fine.

611
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,180
Someone took real good care of me.

612
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,020
You didn't sleep much, right?

613
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,280
Are you tired?

614
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,720
Not at all.

615
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,220
That's good.

616
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,820
Let's have dinner if you're free tonight.

617
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,190
I owe you.

618
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,560
Sure.

619
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,725
DIRECTOR LEE JAE-SHIN

620
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,530
Wow, your room looks better than mine.

621
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,200
Want to switch?

622
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Should I?

623
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,180
Forget it. Hyo-joo will raise hell.

624
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,990
You have plans?

625
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,320
I need to see the chairman.

626
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,490
I have something to report.

627
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Jae-shin.

628
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,430
I don't have to compete with you, right?

629
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,360
Why? You think you can't beat me?

630
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,630
Sheesh.

631
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,120
Why? Do I look like I've no confidence?

632
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,640
-Put it back on.
-Okay.

633
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,740
What do you think about BM Seo for KLAR?

634
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,570
BM Seo?

635
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,250
Based on career experience,
he's a safe bet.

636
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,450
He seems to want it too.

637
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,920
It's not an unreasonable choice.

638
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,090
Let's talk about it over drinks later.

639
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,120
I'll call you.

640
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,700
Let go! Lee Jae-shin is my son!

641
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,100
Go check it.

642
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,070
Stop talking nonsense.

643
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,230
Let go of me!

644
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Son!

645
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Jae-shin!

646
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,880
Son, I came here to see you...

647
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,710
I have no money to give you. Leave.

648
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,480
I found your mom.

649
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,680
My mom?

650
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,590
You know the Yu-mi Supermarket
in our old neighborhood?

651
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,030
Yu-mi's mother saw your mom.

652
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,210
Come with me to see her.

653
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,580
I don't have parents.

654
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,060
My so-called father took my money
and cut ties with me.

655
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,150
My so-called mother left me in that ditch.

656
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,450
She doesn't exist to me.

657
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,020
So stop visiting a stranger
and causing problems.

658
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,550
You bastard.

659
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,220
Bad parents are not even human, is it?

660
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,890
You marry into a rich family

661
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,220
and abandon your parents.

662
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,830
But you know,

663
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,250
no matter how hard you deny it,

664
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,630
you're still my son.

665
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,630
Got it?

666
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You can try all you want.

667
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,430
But those lofty fellows

668
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,970
won't treat you like one of them.

669
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,270
A lap dog.

670
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,610
You're a lap dog they'll exploit,
and then they'll throw you away.

671
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,280
Whose fault is it
that I'm living like a lap dog?

672
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,950
If it weren't for you two...

673
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,990
See?

674
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,480
All you do is blame your parents.

675
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,570
We're the sinners!

676
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,120
Forget it!

677
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,390
I don't need a son like you.

678
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,420
Good.

679
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,300
Stay out of my life then.

680
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,270
Please.

681
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,070
Let's see how well you live!

682
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,370
You're going to regret this!

683
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,430
This Mille-Feuille is much easier to make.

684
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,970
I'll prepare beef sticky rice
Mille-Feuille next time.

685
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,770
Okay. I'll notify the moms
in our group chat.

686
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,440
Alright.

687
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,910
Do you want a glass of beer? I'm thirsty.

688
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,870
What about your work at the restaurant?

689
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,980
It's just one glass.

690
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,880
-I'll have one then.
-Okay.

691
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,140
Be right back.

692
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,020
I forgot the bottle opener.

693
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,790
Hold on.

694
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,430
Huh? Where is it?

695
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,730
Just bring a spoon.

696
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,330
A spoon?

697
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,940
You know how to open it with this?

698
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,470
You don't?

699
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,080
Grab it like this.

700
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,490
I see why you were
a student representative.

701
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,720
That was loud.

702
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I was shocked.

703
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,060
So refreshing.

704
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,360
One more glass?

705
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,700
Do you like to drink?

706
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,470
Not a lot.

707
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,420
But if there's someone to drink with,

708
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,970
I'll have a glass or two.

709
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,440
What about you?

710
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,340
Me too.

711
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,040
I just drink with Woo-hyun.

712
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,650
By the way...

713
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,750
What is it like drinking with him?

714
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,820
Boring, right?

715
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,380
He is kind of boring.

716
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,680
Right?

717
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,750
He doesn't respond to what I say.

718
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,890
Do you do all the talking too?

719
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,450
Anyway,

720
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,040
I know how he's like,

721
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,360
but sometimes I'm hurt.

722
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,030
I can't feel his affection
if he doesn't express it.

723
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,100
Seriously.

724
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,540
Oops.

725
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,240
I ran my mouth too much

726
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,370
in front of his friend.

727
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,780
Sorry.

728
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,810
I guess I feel at ease with you.

729
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,710
I'm certain

730
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,480
that he thinks the world of you.

731
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,320
You're very precious to him.

732
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,920
For sure.

733
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,160
I can see that.

734
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,130
Do you want to be real friends?

735
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,300
Let's be friends.

736
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,440
Rock, paper, scissors!

737
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,810
Rock, paper, scissors!

738
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:06,520
Rock, paper, scissors! Scissors!

739
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,150
We'll get going now.

740
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,640
-Okay, Bye.
-Bye. See you tomorrow.

741
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,610
-Bye, Ha-eun.
-Bye.

742
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,390
What does Jae-young like about you?

743
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,550
How can there be just one thing?

744
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,960
He probably likes everything about me.

745
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,430
It's not love if you only
like one thing about that person.

746
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,100
You really make me speechless.

747
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,150
Why were you so late?

748
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,470
Where's the car?

749
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,160
I had a glass of beer.

750
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,680
I made a friend today.

751
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,910
What kind of friend?

752
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,040
Just a friend.

753
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,080
Like your friends.

754
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,650
A friend I can eat and talk with.

755
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,690
Do you not have friends until now?

756
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,360
Why?

757
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,030
Because you seem really excited.

758
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,710
I like my friend

759
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,700
and what he says to me.

760
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:09,035
MOM

761
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,250
What is it?

762
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,280
<i>Sweetie, can I talk to you right now?</i>

763
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,490
What's the matter?

764
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,560
<i>What time are you coming?</i>

765
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,390
Where to?

766
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,690
<i>Your home.</i>

767
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,160
<i>You'll come back
right after work, right?</i>

768
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,260
You're in Seoul?

769
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,260
Yes.

770
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm cooking kimchi stew with pork
for you right now.

771
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,970
<i>If you come back right after work...</i>

772
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,240
<i>Wait. What time is it now?</i>

773
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,770
Huh? Right.

774
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,880
You'll come before 7 p.m., right?

775
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,410
You should've told me you were coming.

776
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,750
I have plans tonight.

777
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,550
I'm here already. Can't you cancel it?

778
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,020
It's an office gathering.

779
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,320
But I made all this.

780
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,860
Hey, why don't you skip it?

781
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,730
<i>Tell them your mom's home
and just slip out of it.</i>

782
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,760
<i>They can do the gathering without you.</i>

783
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,930
You'll skip it, right?

784
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,190
Hang up for now.

785
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm working.

786
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Okay, then on your way home...

787
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,110
You heartless girl.

788
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,720
That jerk.

789
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,620
Disrespecting the person who raised him...

790
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,460
What is it?

791
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,670
Lee Se-dong, this is the police.
Open the door.

792
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,480
We know you're inside. Open up.

793
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Seriously.

794
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,850
Lee Se-dong!

795
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,570
I got the keys.

796
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,550
Get him!

797
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,750
Hey! Stop right there!

798
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,050
Hey, Lee Se-dong!

799
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,230
Hey!

800
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:43,900
See?

801
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,300
You can get out of the gathering.

802
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,870
They're just going to drink anyway.

803
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,040
Why would you go?

804
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,840
It's better to eat at home with your mom.

805
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,080
Are you done already?

806
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,820
How long are you staying?

807
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,060
I just came today.

808
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,180
I'm going to stay for a while.

809
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,360
What about the shop?

810
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,920
I put up a memo that I'm closing shop
for a while.

811
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,960
What are you doing this weekend?

812
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,770
Want to go shopping with me?

813
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,770
No. How about taking a few days off?

814
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,440
Let's go to Jeju Island.

815
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,070
I heard it's great this time of year.

816
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,040
Just stay until this weekend.

817
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,350
It's not good to close the shop that long.

818
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,010
I'm going to bed.

819
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,790
No, stay and talk with me for a while.

820
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,150
You'll take time off work, right?

821
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,620
I'm not a free-timer. I have a job.

822
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,660
I can't drop everything
just because of you.

823
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,760
Don't you know that?

824
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,360
Come on.

825
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,500
Of course, I know.

826
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,670
But if you have your reasons,
you can take time off.

827
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,360
When I suggest something,

828
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,910
you never just agree to do it.

829
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,430
-What about you?
-What about me?

830
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,580
You never think about me at all.

831
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,880
Even today.

832
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,320
You barged in here
knowing I have a roommate.

833
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,010
You forced me to cancel my plans.

834
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:13,260
It's Ga-young.
She's an old friend, so it's okay.

835
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,700
Are you that upset about missing out?

836
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,130
You didn't even ask why I've come.

837
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,520
Be honest.

838
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,470
You were going to meet
a guy tonight, right?

839
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,040
Do you have a boyfriend?

840
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,080
What if I do?

841
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,510
Really? You really have a boyfriend?

842
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,650
What does he do?

843
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,180
No, forget it.

844
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,950
Stop seeing him.

845
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:42,850
Break up with him.

846
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,320
No man for you.

847
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
No.

848
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,630
I'm dying.

849
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,470
It's cancer.

850
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,710
Yes.

851
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,080
Oh, really?

852
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,080
Thank you.

853
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,960
I'll call you back.

854
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,420
Okay.

855
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,730
I asked a doctor I know.

856
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,760
She said there's only
a small chance of cancer.

857
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,610
Get the surgery.

858
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,480
So that you can get a biopsy.

859
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,700
I'll set up an appointment tomorrow.

860
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,380
I don't want to get surgery.

861
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,980
What then?

862
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,520
It's a small chance,
but it can still be cancer.

863
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,060
Then what are you going to do?

864
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,950
What if it turns out to be cancer?

865
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,560
Are you just going to die then?

866
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,690
How could you talk about death so easily?

867
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,960
Are you not worried
that I might have cancer?

868
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,030
That's why I'm telling you to get surgery.

869
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,900
That's what you should do.

870
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,580
What if I don't wake up
from the anesthesia?

871
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,410
If only your father were alive,

872
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,880
he would've been so worried about me.

873
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,040
Unlike my daughter

874
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,020
who is acting like it doesn't concern her.

875
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,850
Don't get surgery then.

876
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,590
And don't complain to me when it hurts.

877
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,360
How could you?

878
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,760
I'm bothersome to you, is it?

879
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,030
If I get cancer,
it'll be troublesome for you.

880
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,490
So you want me to get surgery
and get rid of me, is it?

881
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,070
Spit it out.

882
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,670
What did I do to you that was so wrong?

883
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,080
Right.

884
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,390
After your father passed away,

885
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,180
it was so hard for me
that I was dependent on you.

886
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,650
Is that a sin?

887
00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:00,020
You've abandoned me
to live your life in Seoul now!

888
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,260
You're dating too,
which I told you not to!

889
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,300
Are you going to marry that guy?

890
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,330
Well, are you?

891
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,300
Are you going to discard me completely?

892
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,570
How long are you going to do this?

893
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,370
What now?

894
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,940
You knew Dad was having an affair!

895
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,410
You knew. And I did too.

896
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,420
What do you mean?

897
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,420
Dad didn't have an affair.

898
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,250
Stop talking nonsense.

899
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,930
If you're going to hate someone,
just hate me then.

900
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,560
Why are you pretending not to know?

901
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,730
Can't you believe that Dad betrayed you?

902
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,800
Or is that the only way to torment me?

903
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,840
Huh?

904
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,210
Do you know what was
really horrible for me?

905
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,980
I know what kind of person Dad was.

906
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,880
I know that you know too.

907
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,450
But when you bound me to your side,

908
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,350
you kept talking about Dad.

909
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,290
If only Dad were here...

910
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,090
Like Dad. Instead of Dad. Dad!

911
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,960
Why can't you break away from him?

912
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,600
Why do you keep tormenting me?

913
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,770
Why did you have to
drag everything out like this?

914
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,830
Huh?

915
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,040
When did you know?

916
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,380
Why didn't you tell me?

917
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,380
You pretended not to know,
like what you're doing now.

918
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,480
How can I tell you anything then?

919
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,150
Still, you should've told me.

920
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:39,290
You're making me a fool.

921
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,190
Unbelievable.

922
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,050
I'm home.

923
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,020
YOON SONG-AH

924
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,560
Here to see your dad?

925
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:17,690
Yes.

926
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,360
Don't run, kids!

927
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,440
Dad!

928
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,400
Honey, I'm home!

929
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,890
-Where's Song-ah?
-In her room.

930
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,510
Song-ah, Dad's home!

931
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,210
Sweetie, I'm home.

932
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,830
I'm opening the door.

933
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,150
Song-ah.

934
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,250
She's already asleep.

935
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,620
You must be hungry.

936
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,430
I'm home.

937
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,510
<i>I went to give Dad some sandwiches.</i>

938
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,720
Mom!

939
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,460
Huh?

940
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,600
Hi, Sweetie.

941
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,230
Why are you here?

942
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,450
Are you alright?

943
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,240
Me?

944
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,370
Of course, I'm alright. Why wouldn't I be?

945
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,580
I can't seem to find your dad.

946
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,780
I'll tell him to eat this
for a late-night snack.

947
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,150
Let's go, Sweetie.

948
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,430
Senior Yoon.

949
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,770
Hyun-seung.

950
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:24,510
What brings you here at this hour?

951
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,340
Just...

952
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,650
I wanted to eat ice cream.

953
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,210
And you popped into my head.

954
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,060
Something happened, right?

955
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,430
Were you crying?

956
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,050
Why would I cry?

957
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,500
There's nothing to cry about.

958
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,540
If it's okay for you,
let's go out for ice cream...

959
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,020
Starting from this moment,

960
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,100
I can't hear anything.

961
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,280
No one can see you.

962
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,840
So,

963
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,200
you can cry here.

964
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,430
Want to go for ice cream?

965
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,200
I like you.

966
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,440
I like you too.

967
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:34,076
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

968
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,708
<i>You know him, right?
He's my right-hand man.</i>

969
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,835
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

970
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,694
<i>Has it been confirmed
that you'll come to our team?</i>

971
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:43,308
<i>It's really over now, right?</i>

972
01:01:45,852 --> 01:01:47,337
<i>Don't think of it that way.</i>

973
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:49,394
<i>Sweetie.</i>

974
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:52,104
<i>I'm Chae Hyun-seung.
I'm her junior at work.</i>

975
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,778
<i>He's really not your boyfriend?</i>

976
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:56,915
<i>I miss you.</i>

977
01:01:58,455 --> 01:02:00,586
<i>Now you're a bit surprised.</i>

978
01:02:03,705 --> 01:02:05,701
<i>It'll be the most beautiful thing
in the world.</i>
