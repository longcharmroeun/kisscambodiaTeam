3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,150
Hey.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,550
Why are you sitting here?

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,830
Where's Ha-eun?

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,430
At my sister's place.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,660
I need to ask you something.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,830
Come sit.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,540
Is there something
between you and Chef Ryu?

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,290
You're not like him, right?

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm not like Han-seo.

12
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,790
Right?

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,940
But...

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,690
Shouldn't you keep your distance then?

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,620
When he contacted you again,

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,620
why didn't you ignore it?

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,800
You said he's a friend.

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,270
Because he is a friend.

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,800
Then you should've kept some distance.

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,810
That would've been best for me and him.

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,370
What happened in college?

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,289
You said something about making a mistake.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,680
What did you do?

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Honey.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,509
It was literally a mistake.

26
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,320
What kind of a mistake?

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,220
If it was a mistake, you could tell me.

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,000
Why can't you tell me?

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,690
It's nothing. I'm not like that.

30
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,640
I said I'm not like that!

31
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,830
Why can't the both of you
just leave me be?

32
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,140
I'm not like that!

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Then...

34
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,410
Do you...

35
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you love me?

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,390
Honey, do you love me?

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,600
I love you.

38
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,620
[Episode 13]

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,890
The banner and
placard designs are confirmed.

40
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,170
What about the products and shopping bags?

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,550
The bags were delivered
to the hosting company.

42
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,870
I'm going to order the products tomorrow.

43
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,829
No shortages?

44
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,040
I've requested a hold-off,
but I'll check again.

45
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,210
-Okay.
-Okay.

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,900
What's a hold-off?

47
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,640
Oh, a hold-off.

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,680
We take the product off the list
so others can't order it.

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,700
Is it accepted all the time?

50
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,020
Not all the time.

51
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,370
-Usually...
-Mr. Ko.

52
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,700
Ask questions after the meeting.

53
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,230
We don't have all day.

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,360
Why fired up all of a sudden?

55
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,950
I want to join the KLAR Team.

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,910
I want to work under ABM Chae.

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,540
You have a good eye.

58
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,180
Okay then. Do your best, okay?

59
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,720
Okay.

60
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,310
That's BM Choi.

61
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,510
She's from the European branch, right?

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,100
Yes.

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,710
I guess she's taking over
the Europe TF Team.

64
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,770
What's the Europe TF Team?

65
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,899
Let's continue.

66
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,810
Okay.

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,420
Thank you for accepting this position.

68
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,120
I was worried that you might not
want to stay there any longer.

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
You promised me full authority
over this project.

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,360
So it wasn't hard to say yes.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,420
I did that because I trust you.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,170
I've read the team
management plan you sent me.

73
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,690
I can count on you, right?

74
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,400
The Chairman has high hopes, too.

75
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,050
Just get ready.

76
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,050
Make me a director
once this project is over.

77
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Let's have dinner together later.

78
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,620
I'm sorry. I have a prior engagement.

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,700
How about tomorrow?

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,800
Sounds good.

81
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,720
Okay.

82
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,730
Working off-site?

83
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,640
[Yes, I'm away right now.]

84
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,490
[Weren't you coming tomorrow?]

85
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,720
Yes, but I got bored, so I came early.

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,030
When will you come back?

87
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,860
I'll just wait here.

88
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,550
[I have dinner plans, too.]

89
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,890
[Just wait for me at home.]

90
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,620
Okay then.

91
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,670
See you at home.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,670
You can use fast delivery service
with our team code.

93
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,000
The delivery man will be in the lobby.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,610
Okay.

95
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,210
Excuse me.

96
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,860
Ma'am.

97
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,840
Hello. You're Senior Yoon's mom, right?

98
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,940
Do you remember me?

99
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,210
Oh.

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,550
In the hospital.

101
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,460
The fruit basket guy.

102
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,280
Yes, I'm the fruit basket guy.

103
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,200
Are you here to see her?

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,390
She's not in the office.

105
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,190
Yes, I heard.

106
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,820
It's my fault for not calling ahead.

107
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,100
Are you leaving now?

108
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,490
Yes.

109
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,400
Maybe we'll meet again.

110
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,650
It was good seeing you.

111
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,500
Ma'am.

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,280
You don't have to give me a ride.

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
I'll pass by the place anyway.

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,240
You are not uncomfortable, right?

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,230
I'm good. I appreciate it.

116
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,140
Is off-site duty that frequent?

117
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,000
Senior Yoon?

118
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,060
She's always out and busy.

119
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,140
Does she do all the work by herself?

120
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,100
We have a lot of off-site work.

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,310
We have to go to stores and training.

122
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,060
Today, there was a shoot.

123
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,410
I didn't know until I worked here,

124
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,950
but there are so many tasks.

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,300
Also, Senior Yoon is good at her job
so everyone calls for her.

126
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,160
My Song-ah is that good?

127
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,630
Yes.

128
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,500
She's very well-known in this field.

129
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,610
She gets offers from other companies too.

130
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,440
She's always been ambitious.

131
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,920
She was never negligent, whatever she did.

132
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,220
She has to accomplish
what she sets her sights on.

133
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,830
She's always been like that
since she was little.

134
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,590
-Really?
-Yes.

135
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,050
She wanted to be the top one in her class,

136
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,820
so she had me sit with her
and studied all night.

137
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,090
Oh, it was so hard.

138
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,990
Why did she want me there
when she was the one studying?

139
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,390
She wouldn't let me sleep.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,850
You know, I'm living by myself.

141
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,130
My parents and I live apart.

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,010
So I have to have dinner alone.

143
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,429
Would you like to eat with me?

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,530
If that's okay with you.

145
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,240
I don't want to eat alone.

146
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,710
Are you sure?

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,700
Song-ah did say she'll be eating out.

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,260
What do you like?

149
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,470
I'll take you anywhere you want.

150
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,090
There's a good BBQ house around here.

151
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,640
There's a Chinese restaurant

152
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,000
and an Italian restaurant here, too.

153
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,450
None of that.

154
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,320
The...

155
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,490
I forgot the name.

156
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,660
Hot pot?

157
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,320
Hot pot?

158
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,540
I saw it on TV.
Do you know a good hot pot place?

159
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,800
Of course. I know all the good places.

160
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,470
Let's go to a hot pot restaurant then.

161
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,410
Okay.

162
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,650
Oh, that's nice.

163
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,680
I love soju.

164
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,590
Me too.

165
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
I love living in Europe.

166
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,510
But soju just doesn't taste
the same over there.

167
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,490
Pork belly, too.

168
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,270
Tell me when you're craving
this again before you leave,

169
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,580
I'll treat you.

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,290
Man.

171
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,110
It seems like yesterday
that you showed up as an intern.

172
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,480
Now you're sitting here with me.

173
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,850
How's work? Still having fun?

174
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,080
It's fun.

175
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,600
You're a strange one.

176
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,860
Work gets boring once you
hit your three-year mark.

177
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,880
But you still find it fun?

178
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,120
There's something
I've been thinking about.

179
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,130
What is it?

180
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,500
The work is fun,

181
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,820
but when I think about five
or ten years from now,

182
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,500
I don't see a huge change.

183
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,530
What I do and what
a general manager does...

184
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,790
They are not that different.

185
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,930
That's right.

186
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,010
Newbies like it because
they can be hands-on.

187
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,590
But the higher you get,

188
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,650
the less accomplished you feel.

189
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,410
It was the same for me.

190
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,310
You too?

191
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,570
Of course.

192
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,110
That's why I asked
to get assigned overseas.

193
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,470
Thank you.

194
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,770
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

195
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,040
This is the mild broth.

196
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,750
This is the spicy broth.

197
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,110
Which one do you prefer?

198
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,680
I'll go with the spicy broth.

199
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,270
The spicy one?

200
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:11,960
Okay.

201
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,870
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks.

202
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,440
It's better if you eat it
with peanut sauce.

203
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,710
How is it? Do you like it?

204
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
It's good.

205
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,270
So this is how it tastes like.

206
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,430
Eat as much as you like.

207
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,500
Please tell me if you need more.

208
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,210
I'm sure you're popular
since you're so sweet.

209
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,850
I'm not sweet to just anyone.

210
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,040
Well...

211
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,750
It's because you're Senior Yoon's mother.

212
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,190
She's trained me
since I joined the company.

213
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
I've learned a lot from her.

214
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,020
So this is nothing.

215
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,670
You must be close with Song-ah then.

216
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,530
I think so. We're a trainer and a trainee.

217
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,870
Can I ask you something?

218
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,540
Is she dating someone?

219
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,040
Huh?

220
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,160
Are you okay?

221
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,630
Yes.

222
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,020
Yes, I'm okay.

223
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,450
So? Is she dating someone?

224
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,450
That has to do with her private life.

225
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,000
That's her private life.

226
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,190
You should eat this.

227
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,310
If it's overcooked,

228
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,110
the meat will become tough.

229
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,300
Let's eat together.

230
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,560
Yes. I'm eating, too.

231
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,260
[So?]

232
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,100
What was it like?

233
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,960
Did it help to be in Europe?

234
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,810
It might be a bit exaggerated,

235
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,770
but it was the best decision
that I've ever made.

236
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,650
It's new and dynamic.

237
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,100
Is it a lot different from here?

238
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,280
Everything is different there.

239
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,120
We're the top player here
but not over there.

240
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,150
It's hard just to get a spot
in a department store.

241
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,040
But we can get the best spot here.

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,350
So it was really a hard job.

243
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,000
But there's so much more
for me to accomplish.

244
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,980
And I learned more that way.

245
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,080
It sounds fun.

246
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,810
That's where trends start.

247
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,520
During the past few years
staying in Europe,

248
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,480
my views of how the market works

249
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,310
and the product development have changed.

250
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,900
When you showed interest last time,

251
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,730
I was hoping that you'd come to join me.

252
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,990
It's a good opportunity to grow.

253
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,380
What's done is done.

254
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,860
What if another opportunity comes up?

255
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,030
I need a color makeup expert on my team.

256
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,240
If you're interested,

257
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,680
I want you to take the job.

258
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,840
Is it too sudden?

259
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,110
I want you to think about it.

260
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,380
I'll give you enough time.

261
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,340
[You said five years?]

262
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,630
Yes.

263
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,570
One or two years to set things up.

264
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,490
And another year or two to settle down.

265
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,000
It'll take at least
five years to be stable.

266
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,550
You can let me know by next week.

267
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,200
Chew it over.

268
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,140
Also,

269
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,260
call me if you have any questions.

270
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,840
Thank you for the ride.

271
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,430
I should've paid earlier.

272
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,570
No, I wanted to treat you.

273
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,570
Thank you for eating with me.

274
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,150
Me too.

275
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,500
Except for my daughter,

276
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,230
nobody's offered to buy me
dinner in a long time.

277
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,670
I see.

278
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,490
If there's something else
you want, let me know.

279
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,360
We can eat together.

280
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,870
Again?

281
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,600
Why would we see each other again?

282
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,740
We might.

283
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,680
Your bag.

284
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,920
Oh, my.

285
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,100
You left your bag in my car.

286
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,760
Good grief.

287
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,990
I can't lose that.

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,740
No, you can't.

289
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,020
It's heavy. Here you go.

290
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,210
Thank you so much.

291
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,530
Sure.

292
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,390
Mom.

293
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,450
Huh?

294
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,110
Sweetie!

295
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,630
What are you two doing together?

296
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,880
I ran into her in the lobby.

297
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,500
I gave her a ride since I was leaving.

298
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,030
I see.

299
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,690
Thank you.

300
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,940
Get home safely.

301
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,530
Okay, Senior Yoon.

302
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,270
Let's go, Mom.

303
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,070
Give me your bag.

304
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,730
Bye.

305
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,090
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

306
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,220
Drive safely.

307
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,940
Yes, I'll do that.

308
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,350
Thank you.

309
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,930
Sure.

310
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,080
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

311
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,100
Go home.

312
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,050
Yes, I'm leaving.

313
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,450
Okay, thank you.

314
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,600
Take care.

315
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,410
[Go.]

316
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,710
Oh? Ma'am!

317
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,750
Hi.

318
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,040
How have you been?

319
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,369
Isn't your appointment tomorrow?

320
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,630
Yes. I just came a day early.

321
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,400
You said you met him at the company.

322
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,430
Why are you so late?

323
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, we stopped to have dinner.

324
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,500
I didn't ask.

325
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,810
He was the one who suggested it.

326
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,250
Why is your bag so heavy by the way?

327
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,650
You're staying for a few days?

328
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,530
Yes.

329
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,660
You told me to take a break
from the restaurant.

330
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,930
I'm bored watching TV all day by myself.

331
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,540
Can...

332
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,990
Can I stay here for a few days?

333
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,280
Since when did you ask
before doing anything?

334
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,820
Do whatever you want.

335
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,840
What's that, Ga-young?

336
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,850
They're nail stickers.

337
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,860
You want to try them on?

338
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,650
Can I?

339
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,970
Sit. I made you one, too.

340
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,010
Maybe next time.

341
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,700
Why not? Let's do it together.

342
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,590
Huh?

343
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,280
How do you do this?

344
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, I'll do it for you.

345
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,700
This is so easy and pretty.

346
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,340
By the way...

347
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,780
You know, that young man?

348
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,590
He's very kind, unlike his peers.

349
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,210
Is he interested in you?

350
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,590
I'll use this one.

351
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,630
Okay.

352
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,990
Please finish her nails.

353
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,950
Okay.

354
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,220
Mommy.

355
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,840
Are you sick?

356
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,710
Hmm?

357
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,530
Do you have a fever?

358
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,310
I don't.

359
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,500
Then does your heart hurt?

360
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,440
Did Daddy make you upset?

361
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,340
What makes you think so?

362
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,100
Jae-young told me.

363
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,000
When I make him upset, his heart hurts.

364
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,530
Because he likes me a lot.

365
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,940
Since you like Daddy a lot,

366
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,180
your heart will hurt if he upsets you.

367
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,460
Yes.

368
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,170
Daddy made me upset.

369
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,420
You want me to punish him?

370
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,960
You?

371
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,100
Yes. A daughter always takes mommy's side.

372
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,650
You know I love you so much, right?

373
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,940
I know.

374
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,520
I love you so much, too.

375
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,860
I love you, Mommy.

376
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
I love you too.

377
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,860
[Senior Yoon Song-ah]

378
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,870
[Are you asleep?]

379
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,830
[Not yet.]

380
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,460
I didn't call because of your mom.

381
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
[She's sleeping now.]

382
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,470
She said you had dinner with her.

383
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,310
Yes.

384
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,580
Did she say anything else?

385
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,410
Why?

386
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,910
[I was careful,
but I might have let something slip.]

387
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,050
She's not suspicious?

388
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,340
She's suspicious of all the men around me.

389
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,260
Don't worry.

390
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,570
That's a relief.

391
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,580
How was your evening?

392
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,980
Did you have a good time with BM Choi?

393
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,340
Yes.

394
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,290
I did.

395
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,130
I guess she really likes you.

396
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,100
She's my role model.

397
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,470
She made me believe in this company.

398
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,990
Then she's my role model, too.

399
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,440
You made me believe in this company.

400
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,580
Introduce me to her later.

401
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,380
Okay.

402
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Hyun-seung.

403
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,780
[Senior Yoon?]

404
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm tired. I should go to bed.

405
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Good night.

406
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,820
Okay.

407
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,730
Good night.

408
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,340
This looks good.

409
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,080
You know the banner
has to go there, right?

410
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,030
Make sure it stands out.

411
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay.

412
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,140
-Go.
-Okay.

413
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,570
Write that down.

414
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,270
Let's go.

415
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,560
Let's place some on the tables, too.

416
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,460
Do that.

417
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,180
Let's play on the light coming in.
Enhance that.

418
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,290
Since this is the entrance.

419
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,030
That's a lot so make sure
you're on top of it.

420
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,860
Products will be set up
on the day of the event?

421
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,180
Yes. It'll start at 6 a.m.

422
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,380
They said it'll take about two hours.

423
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,930
That's enough time to get ready.

424
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,230
Make sure you're on top of everything.

425
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,180
Okay.

426
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,210
Are you going to do
market research with him?

427
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,880
Yes.

428
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,350
Have fun training.

429
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,540
Go home after you're done.

430
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,360
Okay. See you on Monday.

431
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,640
Have a great weekend.

432
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,300
Bye.

433
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,140
There's a popup store for a new brand.
Let's go there.

434
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,670
Okay.

435
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,650
There's a good souffle pancake place here.

436
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,960
Souffle? Where?

437
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,080
You like it?

438
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,220
Not me. My girlfriend does.

439
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,100
Do you want my list of must-eat places?

440
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,110
I check them out for a hobby.

441
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,430
Yes, please.

445
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,640
Sorry for the wait. I had to go to HR.

446
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,310
No worries. I just got here.

447
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,940
Here are the products you needed.

448
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,920
Thank you.

449
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Wait.

450
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,000
I thought this might help.

451
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,740
See you later.

452
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,180
[Transfer Application for Europe Office]

453
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,620
What do you have to say to me?

454
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,760
Don't even think about apologizing.

455
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,840
I'm not going to accept it.

456
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,970
Yeon-seung,

457
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,910
I didn't mean to hurt you.

458
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,480
What did you mean to do then?

459
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,040
Were you going to keep deceiving me?

460
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,150
-Yeon-seung.
-Don't say my name.

461
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,730
I'm disgusted you acted like
you were a friend.

462
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,990
I was blind.

463
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,890
Stay away from me.

464
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,350
From my husband, too.

465
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,850
Wow, it looks good.

466
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Hold on.

467
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,090
Try it.

468
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,770
It's good.

469
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,010
It's good.

470
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,580
You don't even like sweet food.

471
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,020
It's good when I have it with you.

472
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,620
Let's go eat something you like next time.

473
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,890
After we're done with everything you like.

474
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,490
By the way...

475
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,130
This turtleneck.

476
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,920
Does it look good on me?

477
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,990
It does.

478
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,260
I love men's turtleneck look in winter.

479
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,570
That's why I wore this.

480
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,690
You said you like turtlenecks,

481
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,300
so I filled my closet with them.

482
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,010
Did I say that?

483
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,880
In passing, during an office dinner.

484
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,650
So what do you want to say?

485
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,220
My boyfriend looks good.

486
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,690
Okay.

487
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,660
What do you want to do together?

488
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,660
Like what?

489
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,630
I want to experience
all four seasons with you.

490
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,730
I want to see cherry blossoms in spring,

491
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,070
the ocean in summer,

492
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,240
the fall leaves in autumn

493
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,940
and the snow in winter with you.

494
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,500
For the next spring,

495
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,620
let's go see cherry blossoms together.

496
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,890
How about you? What do you want to do?

497
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,650
Whatever you want to do.

498
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,590
Be careful of what you say.

499
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,200
What if I want you
to stay with me forever?

500
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,430
See?

501
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,170
You are too honest as always.

502
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,310
If you're not,

503
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,510
you wouldn't be the Yoon Song-ah I know.

504
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,110
I love it when you say you like something.

505
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,870
You really mean it when you say that.

506
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,950
I'm reminded of that time again.

507
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,350
When you said you like me.

508
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,390
I was so happy then.

509
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,360
Say it one more time.

510
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,700
I like you.

511
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,210
I really like you.

512
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,840
You've got something on you.

513
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,710
Your beauty.

514
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,820
Stop it.

515
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,500
-You are here.
-Yes.

516
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,400
Why did you ask me to come early?

517
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,500
When did you start dating Song-ah?

518
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,140
Hey, I just got here.

519
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,410
Cutting to the chase right away?

520
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,670
It was pretty recent.

521
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,860
Look at you. Do you like her that much?

522
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,350
I feel like I've got the whole world.

523
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,690
That's what I feel.

524
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,920
Did you ask me to come early
just to ask me that?

525
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,790
Not just that.

526
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,000
I want to tell you about
the man I'm dating now.

527
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,490
He's Director Lee Jae-woon.

528
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,610
Director Lee Jae-woon?

529
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,180
The one I know? Chairman's grandson?

530
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Yes.

531
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,070
I just found out recently too.

532
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,710
And that Lee Hyo-joo is his sister.

533
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,580
Does he know I'm your brother?

534
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,590
Not yet.

535
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,570
I wanted to tell you first.

536
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,630
Okay.

537
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,930
Hello.

538
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,040
What's wrong?

539
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,060
Keeping me out of the loop again?

540
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,880
What are you talking about?

541
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
Of course not.

542
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,010
You crept up, that's why.

543
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,810
I thought I saw a ghost.

544
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,970
I was caught off guard. Come, sit.

545
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,050
I warmed up your seat.

546
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,470
Is something wrong, Yeon-seung?

547
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,920
No.

548
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,310
How's the food?

549
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,930
My team's got a new intern,

550
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,580
and he told me about this place.

551
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,400
He knows all the good places.

552
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,340
It's nice.

553
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,410
Can we trust him?

554
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,790
I tried one of his recommendations.
It was good.

555
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,990
With who? Song-ah?

556
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,830
Song-ah?

557

If I'm not going,

742
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,400
there's no need to
mention this and trouble you.

743
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,600
What if you decide to go?

744
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,670
Do I just have to accept
whatever you decide?

745
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,510
Of course not.

746
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,790
What is it then?

747
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,100
I already told you.

748
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,540
I'm not sure whether
it's the right fit for me

749
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,160
or if I could stay overseas for that long.

750
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,710
How long would you be gone?

751
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,040
Five years.

752
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,350
Five years?

753
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,130
Is it supposed to be that long?

754
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,690
It's a new project, so it takes time.

755
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,410
But five years...

756
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,770
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

757
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,550
I'm sorry I talked to you
that way earlier.

758
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,210
I was just taken aback.

759
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,300
You have to make your decision
by the end of this week?

760
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:49,620
Yes.

761
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,380
I'll think hard, too.

762
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,700
Five years is really long.

763
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,870
But even if you go, we're not breaking up.

764
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,550

Have fun today, Ha-eun.

768
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,840
Okay.

770
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,490
You like Mommy a lot, right?

771
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,060
Yes.

772
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,860
Mommy is a very good person.

773
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,170
So hurry up and tell her you're sorry.

774
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,470
Mom's heart is hurting
and so my heart hurts too.

775
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,340
Okay.

776
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,610
I won't hurt her anymore.

777
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,670
See you later.

778
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,950

The house and the clinic.

You can have them all.

799

You can raise Ha-eun.

800

run away and be guilt-free.

I couldn't accept your feelings.

I couldn't reciprocate.

834
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:51,380
You knew that.
That's why you were insecure.

835
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,920

You don't look like a marketer.

You look more like a model.

854
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,990
Ask the PR Team for the original one.

855
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,840

[Did it help to be in Europe?]

[I think you can grow a lot more.]

901
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,290
There are no secrets here.

902

Words get passed around.

there will be regrets.

906
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,700
So choose what you will regret the least.

907
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,890
I hope you don't go.

908
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,580

01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,320
I know all of them
and I'm sorry to say this.

911
