Song-ah.

5
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,010
I want to go, Hyun-seung.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,240
I thought about it a lot.

8
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,930
The more I thought about it,

9
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,660
the more I wanted to go.

10
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,700
I want it.

11
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,490
I want to try.

12
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,720
And I want to do it right.

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,510
The time I have with you right now

14
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,810
is precious to me.

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,650
But I think I'll really regret it
if I give up the chance.

16
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,300
I'm sorry for being selfish.

17
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,759
You really want to go?

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,710
Understood. Go then.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's do this.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Long distance relationship won't be easy.

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,320
But if we're focused on our work,

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,460
five years will go by quickly.

23
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,030
It's not like we won't see
each other at all.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,600
We can video chat.

25
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,200
We can coordinate holidays too.

26
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,730
It's just five years.

27
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,740
Let's give it a go.

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,770
Thank you.

29
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,480
I promise

30
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,550
I'll try very hard to make this work.

31
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,090
I can do this.

[Episode 14]

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
You bought clothes for Ha-eun again?

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,280
She already has a lot.

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,750
It looked so pretty.

36
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,990
Thank you. She'll love it.

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,190
Did you come to give me this?

38
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,830
I wanted to see you, too.

39
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,100
Don't worry about the other day.

40
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,530
I was having a bad day.

41
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,610
We deserved it.

42

The man I'm dating right now

43
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,240
is Hyun-seung's director.

44
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,339
Really?

45
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,459
His girlfriend works there, too.

46
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,709
That's how I found out about them.

47
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,740
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

48
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,820
I won't make you feel left out again.

49
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,890
Alright.

50
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,360
By the way,

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,159
you look pale.

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,330
You didn't look well that day either.

53
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,200
Are you feeling okay?

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,900
I couldn't sleep.

55
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,210
Is something wrong?

56
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,940
Nothing's wrong.

57
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,990
I'm tired because I didn't
get enough sleep.

58
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,340
You don't mind leaving early, right?

59

When you want to talk,

61
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,330
I'll always be here to listen.

62
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,660
I'm in your corner.

63
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,930

[Main Conference Room]

65
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,910
Did you all see the transfer notice?

66
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,720
Song-ah will go to
the Europe TF Team today.

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,190
Things are hectic there,
so the transfer is very rushed.

68
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,920
We haven't decided on her replacement yet.

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,820
Hyun-seung.

70
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,450
Yes?

71
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,790
Do you want to work
with color makeup again?

72
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,200
Me?

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,960
You started in that part.

74
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm asking you since there's a spot.

75
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,100
If you want, you can
take over from Song-ah.

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,470
In that case, we need
someone else to fill his seat.

77
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,540
I'll go to color makeup.

78
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,640
I feel like it's a better fit.

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,980
Hyun-seung, prepare for the handover then.

80
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,180
And Song-ah,

81
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,150
BM Choi wants you to
work for both teams this week.

82
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,200
Did you hear?

83
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,820
Yes, I'm aware.

84
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,120
I believe you can handle it.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
I expect a smooth handover.

86
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,690
Okay.

87
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,420
When are we throwing
a farewell party for Song-ah?

88
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,360
We should, but Song-ah's so busy.

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,030
Let's do it when she's free.

90
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,430
Thank you.

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
It feels strange, doesn't it?

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
Yes.

93
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,610
The transfer is so sudden.

94
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,850
Shall we begin the meeting?

95
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,440
Okay.

96
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,900
Thank you.

97
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,100
Are you still thinking about

98
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,659
your mistake during the charity event?

99
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,910
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,140
I shouldn't have volunteered to do that.

101
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,410
You paid the price for my mistake.

102
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,580
That wasn't that bad.

103
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,480
We face many unexpected challenges here.

104
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,870
What you did was nothing.

105
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,180
Also, there are worse situations.

106
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,390
Like a delayed new release
or a cancelled promotion.

107
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,860
Everyone's forgotten about your mistake.

108
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,590
So snap out of it.

109
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You were proactive,
and that's what matters.

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,870
Don't get discouraged easily
if you want to survive.

111
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,140
Okay.

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,010
Thank you.

113
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,350
Drink your coffee.

114
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,520
Thanks for the coffee.

115
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,080
The coffee tastes terrible.

116
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,050
Don't drink it. I'll go tell them.

117
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,420
Wait.

118
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,800
Oh, this one's mine.

119
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,850
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,760
I saw this on TV and wanted to try it.

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,550
It's nice in Seoul.
I get to try all these things.

122
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,050
They have this in Chuncheon, too.

123
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,180
I can't go by myself.

124
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,380
Make some friends then.

125
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,650
Go take classes or something.

126
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,260
Hang out with your neighbors.

127
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,860
Okay.

128
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,730
By the way, what's the occasion?

129
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,030
You rarely call me out for a meal.

130
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm being transferred
to the European branch.

131
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,470
I have to leave next month.

132
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,570
Europe?

133
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,440
You're going abroad?

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,080
For about five years.

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,060
That's wonderful, Sweetie.

136
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,900
You're not going to stop me?

137
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,500
Why would I do that?

138
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,540
You're going because you're capable.

139
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,240
Next month is pretty soon though.

140
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Why the rush?

141
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,690
Can I really go?

142
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm trying to change.

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,690
I feel bad for what I've put you through.

144
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,970
I'm not going to be unreasonable anymore.

145
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,600
I've put away your dad's letters.

146
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,420
And his pictures too.

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you sick again?

148
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,780
Why?

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,870
You think I've changed because I'm dying?

150
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,860
I know how much you suffered.

151
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,700
The least I can do is try to change.

152
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,330
I'm going to try being a good mom now.

153
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Can I stay in Seoul until you leave?

154
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,500
I promise I won't be a bother.

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,100
Suit yourself.

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
We should've eaten Korean food.

157
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,020
You'll miss it once you're there.

158
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,180
Let me know what you want to eat.

159
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,810
I'll cook it for you.

160
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,380
Okay.

161
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,820
I'll catch up with you later.

162
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,590
Okay.

163
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,400
Ji-seung!

164
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hmm?

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,640
Oh, Director Lee?

167
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,680
Yes.

168
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,840
Ji-seung!

169
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,210
Oh...

170
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,830
Chae Ji-seung.

171
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,800
Chae Hyun-seung.

172
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,730
Your names are so similar.

173
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,810
I didn't even notice.

174
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,180
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

175
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,150
I didn't want things to get awkward.

176
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,240
My brother learned about us
just recently too.

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,850
What are the odds?

178
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,150
I knew there was a reason I liked you.

179
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,760
By any chance,

180
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
did I mistreat you in any way?

181
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,530
I hope I was always fair to you.

182
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,700
Not at all.

183
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
Please treat me as you did before.

184
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,540
No special treatment.

185
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,490
It's more comfortable for me.

186
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,270
Still, let me know
if you're having a hard time.

187
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,110
I'll help in any way I can.

188
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,580
And...

189
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,020
Hope you help me out, too.

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,620
Yes.

191
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,620
Let's dig in.

192
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,750
Okay.

193
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,980
Enjoy.

194
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,160
Try this first.

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,630
This is their specialty.

196
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,670
Thank you.

197
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,640
I'll keep you updated about
the products in development.

198
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,330
That's the most important thing.

199
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,250
Okay.

200
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Oh...

201
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,620
How was lunch with your mother?

202
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,990
What did she say when she heard the news?

203
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,490
She said that it's wonderful.

204
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,090
She wished me good luck.

205
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,140
That's great.

206
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,840
You were so worried.

207
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,310
Since she found out I knew about Dad,

208
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,530
I guess she did a lot of thinking.

209
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,810
Had I known that earlier,

210
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,840
I would've discussed this
with her a lot sooner.

211
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,340
Anyway,

212
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,090
I'm glad it went well.

213
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,890
Right,

214
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,370
I don't know if it's
appropriate to say this,

215
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,860
but your mother is very cute.

216
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,540
She's like a little girl.

217
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,590
My mom?

218
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,900
If she needs anything while you go abroad,

219
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,330
let me know.

220
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,430
Okay.

221
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,550
I want to look at you as much as I can.

222
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,120
Can you go home a bit late tonight?

223
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,280
I have to go to the TF Team after this.

224
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,000
At this hour?

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,530
I also have to go through
the handover process.

226
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,330
I know!

227
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,170
Let's spend the weekend together.

228
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,310
Hmm?

229
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,350
Why are you getting a divorce?

230
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,020
And on top of that,

231
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,480
you're giving her
the house and the clinic!

232
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,020
Did you cheat on her?

233
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,490
I've said what I needed to say.

234
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't contact Yeon-seung.

235
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,010
-How dare you!
-No!

236
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,130
Impudent prick.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,500
How dare you behave like this!

238
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,760
Divorce?

239
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,660
What's the reason?

240
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,240
What in the world have you been doing?

241
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,780
Whatever the reason is,
there will be no divorce.

242
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,900
There will be.

243
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,210
I've made up my mind.

244
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,920
You prick.

245
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,490
Gosh!

246
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,490
Here.

247
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,420
Good girl.

248
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,650
[Mother-in-law]

249
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,100
Hello, Mother.

250
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,690
Hold on, please.

251
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,480
Woo-hyun said that?

252
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,370
I don't know what he did wrong,

253
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,290
but can you forgive him
and move past this?

254
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,230
[Think about Ha-eun.
You can't divorce him.]

255
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,170
We are never getting a divorce.

256
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,630
Then why did Woo-hyun say that?

257
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,900
[Mother.]

258
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,920
I have to watch Ha-eun.

259
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,840
Don't worry. Please tell Father that too.

260
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,990
You're going out?

261
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,290
Yes.

262
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,690
I'm meeting someone.

263
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,270
Who are you meeting?

264
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,080
The young man from work?

265
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,770
He's your boyfriend, right?

266
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,780
No!

267
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
Yes.

268
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,710
He's my boyfriend.

269
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,060
I knew it.

270
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Who buys dinner for a co-worker's mother?

271
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,790
Anyway,

272
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,490
you have good taste.

273
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Wait.

274
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,960
What happens between
you two when you leave?

275
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,410
He's okay with it?

276
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,430
Yes.

277
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,070
It must've been a hard decision.

278
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,600
It's not easy for
the person being left behind.

279
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,240
There are challenges when you're together.

280
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,579
It'll be even tougher if you're apart.

281
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,150
I have to go.

282
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,109
Make sure you eat something.

283
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,339
Go have fun.

284
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,290
Go.

285
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,359
It's cold. Let's go.

286
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,369
Okay.

287
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,840
[Good morning.]

288
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
[What would you like to order?]

289
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,140
Just a second, please.

290
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,040
What do you want?

291
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,650
A hot americano.

292
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,550
Two hot americanos, please.

293
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,550
[Okay. Please pull up at the front.]

294
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,650
Okay.

295
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,850
Here you go.

296
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,460
Thank you.

297
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,760
Here.

298
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,230
Thank you.

299
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,200
I like the aroma.

300
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,900
I like you more.

301
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,570
Me, too.

302
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,280
Before you begin making your rings,

303
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,680
please choose one of the designs.

304
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,610
Okay.

305
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,750
What do you think suits us the most?

306
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,210
How about something simple like this?

307
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,490
I like it simple.

308
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,120
Is this popular?

309
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,710
What size is my finger?

310
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,430
Do you know?

311
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,360
I don't.

312
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,630
Let's find out.

313
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,260
-No. 24?
-No. 24?

314
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,570
No, that's too big.

315
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,570
It is.

316
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,530
Sorry.

317
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,530
Careful.

318
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,000
Ready?

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes.

320
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,390
-Dunk it in the water.
-In the water...

321
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,900
That's pretty.

322
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,540
Yes.

323
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,440
I think mine's done.

324
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Yes.

325
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,080
[BM Choi Eun-Jung]

326
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,680
Answer it.

327
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,490
Just a moment.

328
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,230
Hello?

329
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,630
Right now?

330
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,310
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,910
Go home. I'll call you after I'm done.

332
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,410
You said it won't take long.

333
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,610
I'll just wait here. Take your time.

334
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,950
Okay.

335
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,380
I'll be done as soon as possible.

336
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,190
Okay.

337
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,320
Sorry.

338
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
It's okay.

339
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,810
It's good.

340
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,140
Just add more information here.

341
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,020
Which part?

342
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,850
Here.

343
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,890
Break down customer segmentation
into smaller groups

344
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,530
and add other factors.

345
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,470
Also, provide more basis
for linking each target group

346
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,070
to the respective distribution platforms.

347
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Okay.

348
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,670
Get it started.

349
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,520
Are you done? I'm still here.

350
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,490
[I'm sorry.]

351
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,590
I think it'll take longer.

352
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,720
It's okay. I'll wait.

353
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,060
I don't know when I'll be done.

354
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,920
It might be better to wait for me at home.

355
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,130
[It's cold, too.]

356
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,700
Okay. Don't worry about me.

357
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,130
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,030
We need to talk.

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,010
Why did you say that to your...

360
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,180
What happened to your face?

361
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,290
How could he hit you?

362
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,700
Do you really want to divorce me?

363
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,640
If you want a divorce,

364
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,790
tell me this one thing.

365
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,280
You said you're not like Han-seo.

366
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,380
Is that true?

367
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Yes.

368
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,910
It's true.

369
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,450
I'm not like him.

370
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,920
We just clicked and got close.

371
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,020
I didn't know he was like that.

372
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,590
When he told me,

373
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,730
I might have felt
some unexplainable feelings.

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,530
But it was just curiosity.

375
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,870
That was it.

376
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,000
There's no way I'm like him.

377
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,340
I've never felt anything like that again.

378
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,210
So that means I'm not like that.

379
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,120
I don't like men.

380
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,950
Stop sleeping in the study room.

381
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,150
Ha-eun knows we're having problems.

382
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,920
I don't want her to suffer, too.

383
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,490
What are you doing up late?

384
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,900
I don't know what to do.

385
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,820
To me,

386
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,040
Jae-shin is everything.

387
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,690
He's my everything.

388
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,210
How can I possibly let him go?

389
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,750
It's all my fault.

390
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,710
I left you alone when we were kids.

391
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,560
I sent you to the States by yourself.

392
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,900
I wanted to make up for that,

393
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,200
so I gave you everything you wanted.

394
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,270
That's my biggest mistake.

395
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,200
I shouldn't have left you alone.

396
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,780
If it's hard to let him go right now,

397
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,790
focus on what you can do then.

398
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,660
If you start looking after yourself,

399
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,080
you'll learn to let him go

400
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,030
eventually.

401
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,120
Good work today.

402
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,420
Let's do the rest tomorrow.

403
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,080
Okay. See you tomorrow.

404
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,090
Bye.

405
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,640
Do you want another one?

406
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,430
I'm sorry. I was so hungry.

407
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,500
I thought you went home.

408
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,440
I wanted to see you just a bit more.

409
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,940
We don't have a lot of time left.

410
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,400
But it was cold outside.

411
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,850
It wasn't that cold. Don't worry.

412
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,690
Okay, I won't do that anymore.

413
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,450
Hmm?

414
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,900
Have some kimchi.

415
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,240
Hyun-seung,

416
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,730
the copy machine is broken.

417
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,660
I forgot to call General Affairs.

418
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,020
I'll call them.

419
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,220
I can take a look. I've fixed one before.

420
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,920
No, Myung-jin. It's okay.

421
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,120
I get nervous when you say
you can do something.

422
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,420
I really know how to fix it.

423
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,260
I can do it.

424
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,590
I know you can do it.

425
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,030
But you don't have to.

426
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,330
You really want to do something?

427
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,760
Yes.

428
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,800
We'll receive an essence sample
from the courier soon.

429
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,540
Can you go down and get that?

430
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,400
Yes, sir!

431
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,700
Okay then.

432
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,510
Stop messing with him.

433
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,580
Yes, stop.

434
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,040
It's funny.

435
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,980
I'm glad he looks like his normal self.

436
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,720
The office seems empty without Song-ah.

437
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,960
We need her replacement.

438
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,420
I'm still looking for one.

439
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,350
Hi, this is Chae Hyun-seung from KLAR.

440
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,370
Oh, hello.

441
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,180
There's a sealing issue with Renew Stick?

442
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,780
Didn't we fix the issue
before we go into production?

443
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,350
Yes, we did.

444
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,650
But what's manufactured now
is below standard.

445
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,690
Quality Assurance checked twice.

446
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,460
They said it's no good.

447
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,130
This is going to be
a freebie for a promotion.

448
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,560
Didn't the department store
notify the customers already?

449
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,070
The event is taking place this weekend.

450
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,390
How are we going to replace 100,000 gifts?

451
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,840
Do we have to cancel the event?

452
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,970
Then it'd become a bigger problem.

453
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,740
The department store is throwing
a huge beauty fair this time.

454
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,950
What did the lab say?

455
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,300
This is their mistake.

456
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,980
They're flustered, too.

457
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,250
They sent staff to the factory.

458
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,780
And what?

459
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,990
That's not going to get the problem fixed.

460
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,290
Can't they do their jobs right?

461
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,820
The blame will fall on us.

462
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,460
Calm down, Yoo-sun.

463
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,160
Manager Yoo.

464
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,250
Can we remanufacture on time?

465
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,970
We need to know
if the issue can be fixed first.

466
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,660
It'll be safer to find other free gifts.

467
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,700
Hyun-seung,

468
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,970
find out what we can use
as gifts right away.

469
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,870
-Yes, sir.
-Check if extra production is possible.

470
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,780
Okay.

471
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,080
I'll make some calls here.

472
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Me too.

473
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,380
Is there anything
you can produce by tomorrow?

474
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,550
We have a big event,
and this is an emergency.

475
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,490
Tomorrow?

476
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,920
No way.

477
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,320
The lines are full.

478
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,130
Could you give us a single line?

479
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,930
Please?

480
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,560
I understand it's urgent,

481
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,200
but there's nothing I can do.

482
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,310
It's event season.
The lines are being run to the max.

483
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,740
You'll have to ask elsewhere.

484
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,240

two weeks from now, isn't it?]

487
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,390
You're right but we're in a pinch.

488
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,990
You said you have the materials.

489
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,060
Could you move up the production?

490
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,450

delivery deadline to meet.

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,690
How about a portion of the full volume?

493
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,130
We have an important event,
and this is really urgent.

494
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,500
We might have to cancel the event.
So could you please think about it?

495
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,380
[It's just not doable.]

496
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,540
We're really swamped, too.

497

498
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,510
Alright. Okay.

499
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,820
Mr. Park, don't shout. Come on.

500
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,460
You know we didn't want this to happen.

501
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,900
Watch your blood pressure. Hello?

502
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,200
Hello!

503
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,430
What a temper.

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,360
I don't know how he's in sales.

505
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,660
It's a great idea.

506
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,740
Develop one product that will be a hit

507
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,720
and focus on the online market.

508
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,090
A cosmetic brand could have
hundreds of products,

509
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,760
but most of the sales still
come from the key items.

510
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,520
As you read in my proposal,

511
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,330
this venture will focus on
making a few key items

512
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,200
and generate sales
higher than most brands.

513
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,700
If that could happen as you say,

514
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,180
it'd be great.

515
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,960
It sounds possible but...

By any chance,

522
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,230
is it because of
Director Lee Jae-woon from KLAR?

523
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,060
You knew?

524
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I had a hunch.

uncomfortable like you did.

Mr. Lee,

529
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,980
it will be hard to find an investor.

530
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,120
Director Lee is pulling
all the strings to hinder you.

531
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,450
It'll be easier for you to give up.

532

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:22,060
and others love quietly
and awkwardly as he does.

558
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,840
So I...

559
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,940
When he...

560
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,090
He always said thank you
instead of saying he loves me.

561
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,950
Turns out it was all
because he felt guilty.

562
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,100
You know what's funny?

563
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,870
I was deceived for eight years.

564
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,420
He might have deceived me all our lives.

565
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,840
But when I see him struggling
to come to terms with this,

566
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,980
I'm just worried about him.

567
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,850
If we get a divorce,

568
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,520
then...

569
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,730
He'll have to struggle all by himself.

570
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,030
It's so heartbreaking.

571
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,640
What am I going to do?

572
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,240
Hey.

573
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,760
Are you still busy?

574
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,470
Yes.

575
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,230
[Is something wrong?]

576
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Oh.

577
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,210
Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.

578
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,170
[I'll let you get back to work.]

579
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,180
Okay.

580
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,980
Song-ah.

581
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,690
Yes.

582
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,010
[So you're telling me]

583
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,810
that you haven't found
a replacement gift yet?

584
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,550
That's right.

585
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,880
We're looking into all avenues,

586
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,890
but it's just impossible
to get 100,000 new gifts.

587
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,880
What's the alternative?

588
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,690
We can't cancel the event.

589
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,760
For now, we can either
give out random freebies,

590
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,000
or send out the original
promotional gift after the event.

591
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,440
Either way, it will result in
numerous complaints.

592
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,310
We have the whole day to decide,

593
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,970
so let's think about which is better.

594
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,610
And I want a report
on the projected additional cost.

595
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,310
Yes, sir.

596
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,650
You need to make a decision now.

597
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,390
We can't keep Sales waiting much longer.

598
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,330
Let's go with random gifts.

599
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,130
If we send them out later,
we'll get more complaints.

600
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,730
Let's double the value
for the gifts instead.

601
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,870
Do we still have
the leftover freebies from before?

602
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,870
Yes.

603
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,110
Okay.

604
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,780
You did a good job.

605
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,230
This is your first big emergency.

606
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,510
It's okay.

607
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,980
There are worse things in the world.

608
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,590
I'll go report to Director Lee.

609
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,320
Hello.

610
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,460
How about we send the pouches
over the next few days?

611
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,800
Of course!

612
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,330
Of course, that's fine.

613
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
Sir!

614
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,800
We'll get 30,000 pouches on Thursday
and another 30,000 on Friday.

615
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,300
The remaining 40,000 will be
dispatched on Saturday.

616
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,140
Okay. Sounds like the event is a go.

617
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,380
Yes, I think it'll go smoothly.

618
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,980
When we tested the pouches,
people responded well.

619
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,380
I don't think we'll hear
any complaints at the event.

620
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,120
Good job.

621
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,140
I'm glad you've stopped the disaster.

622
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm very sorry.

623
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,420
This won't happen again.

624
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,790
I'm sorry, Manager Kwon.

625
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,530
Let the Sales Team know about this.

626
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,260
I'll inform the Sales Director.

627
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,400
Okay.

628
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,670
Alright, sir.

629
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,310
Manager Ahn.

630
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,010
Hey, you're here.

631
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,410
Here you go.

632
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,310
Thank you.

633
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,610
Oh, he's out.

634
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,220
For the pouch shoot.

635
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,350
Right.

636
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,250
It was his first time,
so he must have gone through hell.

637
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,220
But everything's okay now.

638
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,590
Did something happen?

639
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,960
You don't know?

640
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,590
There was an issue with the Renew Stick.

641
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,130
We almost had to cancel the event.

642
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,800
Hyun-seung made calls everywhere,

643
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,270
and he pushed the pouch production
and saved the day.

644
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,570
That's a relief.

645
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,310
I guess he didn't tell you
because you'd be worried.

646
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,380
Perhaps I shouldn't have said anything.

647
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,880
No, it's fine.

648
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,870
Right?

649
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,420
I'll see you later.

650
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Okay.

651
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,980
[Temporarily closed]

652
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,330
I won't have much to prepare

653
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,020
as you're leaving everything behind.

654
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,470
They're all newly purchased.

655
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,070
You won't have any problems.

656
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,300
Where are you going by the way?

657
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,310
You're selling
when the store is doing well.

658
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,750
I figure you're moving
to an even better spot.

659
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,680
I wanted to get out
of the city for a while.

660
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,220
I'll see you when we sign the contract.

661
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,990
Sure, I'll see you then.

662
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Let's go.

663
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,090
What is a good time for you?

664
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,320
How about Saturday?

665
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,460
It's the divorce paper you wanted.

666
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,820
I signed it.
All that's left is your signature.

667
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Thank you.

668
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,440
Woo-hyun,

669
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,580
I want to tell you something.

670
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,240
It doesn't matter who you are

671
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,120
or who you love.

672
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,860
You are the same
Kang Woo-hyun that I love.

673
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,430
If...

674
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,530
Even if

675
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,260
what your friend said to you is true,

676
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,430
that's not wrong.

677
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,470
That's not abnormal.

678
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,770
I'm worried about you.

679
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,210
I see you spend your whole life

680
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,810
torturing yourself with those thoughts.

681
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,950
That won't happen.

682
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,350
Are you sure?

683
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,950
Yes.

684
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,720
Do this for me then.

685
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,530
Do it as a last favor for me.

686
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,650
For once in your life,

687
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,270
open your heart to yourself.

688
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,740
See what's inside.

689
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:50,780
If you think you can't do it alone,

690
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,050
I'll be by your side.

691
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,590
How could I do that to you?

692
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,760
I want to do it for you.

693
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,260
That's who you are to me.

694
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,600
If you even cherished me at all,

695
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,620
please do as I ask.

696
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,410
Until you can accept yourself for you are.

697
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,210
Just until then.

698
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,300
This is delicious.

699
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,670
It's been a while since we shared a meal.

700
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,810
Are you eating these days?

701
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,700
You look slimmer.

702
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,170
I ate well.

703
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,450
Don't worry.

704
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,150
Hyun-seung,

705
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,690
I heard there was an issue
with the Renew Stick.

706
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,190
You heard that?

707
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,000
It's all resolved now. Don't worry.

708
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,280
Why didn't you tell me?

709
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,850
Because I was too busy?

710
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,970
You had a lot on your plate.

711
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,300
I didn't want to add to that.

712
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,380
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,820
Why are you sorry?

714
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,050
You must have been so worried,

715
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,860
but you hid it from me
so that I wouldn't worry.

716
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,000
It's fine.

717
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,870
Things worked out anyway.

718
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,490
I'm the one who's being selfish.

719
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,470
But you're paying the price for it.

720
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,510
You always put me first.

721
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,410
You hold back. You keep silent.

722
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,910
I'm always taking what you give.

723
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,720
I do that because I want to do it.

724
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,460
Listen.

725
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,070
Holding back while waiting is nothing.

726
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,370
I'm more upset and worried

727
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,080
to see you feel this bad about it.

728
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,510
You know how you can make me feel better?

729
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,600
Don't think that way.

730
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,900
[I'm the one who's being selfish.]

731
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,240
But you're paying the price for it.

732
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,510
If you want to say something, say it.

733
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,640
Well...

734
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,350
Are you okay?

735
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,380
No.

736
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,680
How could I be?

737
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,820
I've loved him for years.

738
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,120
But...

739
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,650
I will be fine.

740
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,710
I'm going to give myself
all the love I gave him.

741
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,600
I'm going to work a lot more.

742
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,740
We're going to get very busy.
Are you up for it?

743
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,350
Absolutely.

744
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:11,970
Here.

745
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,280
[Hot pepper and mayo chicken]

746
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,270
It's hot but good, right?

747
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,430
Yes.

748
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,530
So good.

749
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,810
You're such a scaredy-cat.

750
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,010
It's coming out again.

751
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,140
Please don't do that.

752
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,180
Come on, focus.

753
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,410
No.

754
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,010
Go.

755
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,020
Why is he so slow?

756
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,420
- Goal!
-Pass.

757
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,090
-Goal!
-Son Heung-min...

758
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,560
It's Son Heung-min.

759
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,160
Are your fingers still asleep?

760
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,230
No, it's my shoulders.

761
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,460
-Your shoulders. I see.
-Yes, my shoulders.

762
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,130
I think they're good now. Let's go.

763
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,570
-Stay still, right hand.
-Hey!

764
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,270
What happened? That was weird.

765
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,740
Did you try to take my controller?

766
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,440
It was an honest mistake.

767
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,480
Hey!

768
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,780
Stop lying.

769
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,510
You're a cheater!

770
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:57,610
What do you mean a cheater?

771
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,750
My hand! Stay, right hand!

772
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,840
What are you doing?

773
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,580
Man.

774
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,180
So? Do you like it?

775
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,750
Perfect.

776
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,550
It's so beautiful that I want to save it.

777
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,790
Don't worry. Wear it as much as you want.

778
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,760
From now on,

779
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,690
you have to wear only what I make you.

780
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,160
Hold up.

781
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,200
It sounds like you're saying

782
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,370
you'll be by my side forever.

783
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,170
You're too good of a catch.

784
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,510
I'm not letting you slip away.

785
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,110
Yes!

786
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:08,540
Gosh!

787
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,880
-Hooray!
-What are you doing?

788
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,950
Yes!

789
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,650
Put me down!

790
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,890
Hey.

791
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,320
Let's not think of it as five years.

792
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,190
Think of it as a few months.

793
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,460
There's summer leave. I'll go visit.

794
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,230
We can meet before the new year too.

795
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,500
It won't feel that long then.

796
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,510
Okay.

797
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,580
A few product releases,

798
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,380
and it will soon be summer.

799
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,990
Promise me.

800
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,990
Don't feel unsure.

801
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,440
Don't feel guilty.

802
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,640
Take what you need
and buy the rest over there.

803
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,640
I will.

804
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:49,240
Want me to pack you gochujang?

805
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,550
Oh, laver! Take some laver!

806
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,350
Hold on. I'll go buy some.

807
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:55,440
They have it there.

808
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,950
There are Korean restaurants, too.

809
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,720
Just in case.

810
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,480
Wait. I'll go buy some.

811
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,060
You said you're going to Paris?

812
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,060
Yes.

813
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,100
Promise me you'll visit.

814
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,200
I'll put you up.

815
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,530
You better not shove me in a hotel.

816
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,670
What am I going to do now
when you're gone?

817
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,380
I'll be so bored.

818
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,110
You won't have time to be.

819
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,220
You have to win the Gold Button.

820
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,380
Huh?

821
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,420
What Gold Button?

822
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,820
You thought I wouldn't know
if you wore a mask?

823
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,590
I came across your videos at work,

824
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:35,620
and I could tell it's you
by the sound of your voice.

825
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,010
You're good.

826
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,960
I am, aren't I?

827
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,000
You just wait.

828
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,130
While you're in Europe,

829
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,370
I'll definitely win the Gold Button.

830
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:46,270
Sure, go get it.

831
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:48,570
I can't wait to see it in person.

832
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,300
Get packing.

833
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,920
I'm glad I get to sleep
next to you before you leave.

834
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,720
Stay until I'm set to leave.

835
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:10,590
I'll feel sad if I see you leaving.

836
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,390
Your boyfriend is sending
you to the airport, right?

837
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,860
Yes.

838
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:21,190
Living abroad is hard.

839
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,340
Even if you're far away,

840
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,080
I feel better knowing you
have somebody to lean on.

841
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,850
While I'm gone,

842
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,450
I hope you can find someone to lean on.

843
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,220
Whether that's a friend or someone else,

844
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,390
I want you to have someone
to trust and rely on.

845
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,160
It's too late for that.

846
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,470
It's nice.

847
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,490
Having someone to take care of you.

848
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,900
I just feel bad that
I can't give him enough.

849
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,550
Not as much as I receive.

850
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,020
That's normal.

851
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,320
You want to offer as much as you receive.

852
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,900
I want to give more to you, too.

853
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,220
Let me give you a hug.

854
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,370
Huh?

855
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:25,900
What?

856
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,140
Come here.

857
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,040
Oh, dear.

858
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,780
My sweet girl.

859
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,890
[Three years later]

860
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:00,500
Manager Chae.

861
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,640
Yes, sir.

862
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,870
About your new request...

863
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,440
Do we have to support the Sales Team?

864
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,220
It'd be a nice gesture.

865
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,750
They helped with our sales last month.

866
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,880
You said you'd help out
with their promotional items.

867
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,880
I did?

868
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,010
I don't remember though.

869
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,120
If I promise, I have to do it. Okay.

870
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,160
Alright, sir.

871
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,860
Hyun-seung.

872
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,970
Are you coming to the gathering later?

873
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,800
Min-seong will make a fuss if I don't.

874
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,960
He'll probably barge into your place.

875
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,380
We've had monthly gatherings
for the past four years.

876
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,880
That's because he's
the president of our group.

877
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,050
Want to take over?

878
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:45,950
Me?

879
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:46,410
Yes.

880
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,460
No, thank you.

881
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,950
Manager Chae,

882
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,080
you have a training meeting.

883
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,090
Okay.

884
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,190
I'll contact you afterward.

885
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:53,990
Okay.

886
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:56,420
You got everything we need?

887
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,110
Yes, I got everything.

888
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:01,900
Everyone in the Europe TF Team
is getting promoted.

889
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,280
They deserve it.

890
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,500
Yoon Song-ah is in my year group.

891
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,100
She'll become a general manager soon.

892
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,420
When will I move up?

893
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,850
Hyo-joo.

894
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,390
Yes?

895
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,990
Are you going to keep on
working after marriage?

896
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,420
Of course.

897
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,990
I've worked hard to build my career.

898
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,860
If you oppose it,
then this is a waste of my time.

899
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,670
Oh, not that.

900
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,330
Do whatever you please.

901
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,840
My parents would love
their daughter-in-law working.

902
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,880
Who says I want to be
their daughter-in-law?

903
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,040
Over here, CEO Lee.

904
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,800
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

905
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,400
That's okay. I came early.

906
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,000
Thank you for coming to meet me.

907
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,480
I went on a blind date.

908
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,490
You look like you've been doing well.

909
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,760
I've been doing great myself too.

910
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,800
As you said, I'm doing well without you.

911
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,830
I can tell.

912
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,070
Take care then.

913
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,170
[When are you coming? Hurry up!]

914
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:22,270
I'm on my way.
I'm about to cross the street.

915
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:24,170
You keep this up and I'm going home.

916
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,860
[Alright, you brat.]

917
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,980
[Grace us with your presence, please.]

918
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,150
Alright, I'll be there soon.
