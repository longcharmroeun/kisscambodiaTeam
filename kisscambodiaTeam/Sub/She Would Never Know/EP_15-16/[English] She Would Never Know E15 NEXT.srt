00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,830
{\an8}ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,260
{\an8}RETURN APPLICATION

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,970
Everything seems to be in order.

4
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,310
I'll process this.

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,180
-Thank you.
-By the way,

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,080
why did you choose to return?

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,820
The branch manager was sad to see you go.

8
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,950
Things are going smoothly now,

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,310
but you're leaving after
laying the groundwork.

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,420
I think I've gained enough experience.

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,290
Actually,

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,830
I miss home.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,730
I'll leave you to it. Thank you.

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,200
Okay.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,310
Alright, I'll be there soon.

16
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,400
I think it's completely useless.

17
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,510
You're back?

18
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,980
{\an8}EPISODE 15

19
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,510
Yes.

20
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,250
Reading your inbox?

21
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,880
Yes.

22
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,780
So many people have relationship issues.

23
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,050
It takes a long time
to read these through.

24
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,150
It's because you're a hot commodity.

25
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,690
That I am.

26
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,320
If you were there
two more years as planned,

27
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,660
I would've gotten my Gold Button.

28
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,060
You came back too early.

29
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
Fine, it's my fault.

30
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,700
At least you're quick to acknowledge it.

31
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,440
Did you have dinner? I haven't.

32
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,160
Let's eat together. Let me get changed.

33
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,170
Okay.

34
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,330
{\an8}WINTER, TWO YEARS AGO

35
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,230
Asst. Manager Yoon Song-ah.

36
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Yes!

37
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:30,940
Yes, ma'am?

38
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,450
We'll be meeting with that OEM company.

39
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,220
Get two tickets to London
for tomorrow morning.

40
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,690
One is yours.

41
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,090
My leave starts tomorrow.

42
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,390
Oh, right.

43
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
What to do...

44
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,400
I really need you there.

45
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry,

46
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,400
but can you cancel your leave?

47
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,710
You know this is important.

48
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,350
A business trip?

49
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,350
<i>Yes.</i>

50
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,420
<i>A meeting suddenly came up.</i>

51
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,120
This company is playing hard-to-get.

52
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,620
It'll be difficult to reschedule.

53
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
It's okay. It's work anyway.

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry to make you wait.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,360
<i>It's okay.</i>

56
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,370
I know things are hard over there.

57
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,200
Don't worry. Do what you need to do.

58
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,470
Thank you.

59
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,750
What?

60
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,220
{\an8}SUMMER, ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO

61
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,860
Why can't it come through?

62
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,430
You said there'd be no problem this time.

63
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,240
You know we need them.

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,180
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

65
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,290
{\an8}SENIOR YOON SONG-AH

66
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,750
<i>There's a customs issue
with a key product.</i>

67
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,180
<i>I can't go to Korea.</i>

68
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,550
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

69
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,670
Hey.

70
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,740
You're awake?

71
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,810
It's okay.

72
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,540
I understand. Stop feeling so bad.

73
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,210
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

74
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,250
I really want to see you.

75
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,220
It's fine.

76
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,920
Don't cry. You'll make me sad.

77
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,820
Hmm?

78
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,010
Okay.

79
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,790
<i>Don't skip meals. We'll talk soon.</i>

80
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,430
{\an8}WINTER, A YEAR AGO

81
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,700
Alright, it's okay.

82
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,840
Don't worry. Just get your work done.

83
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay.

84
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,020
Hey.

85
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,680
You're home.

86
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,900
Have you eaten?

87
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,500
You must be so exhausted.

88
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,040
Aren't you angry at all?

89
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,710
You came to see me.

90
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,710
We haven't seen each other
in one and a half years.

91
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,150
And yet I made you wait.

92
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,180
But look at you,

93
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,290
how could you worry about me?

94
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,790
Don't you resent me?

95
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,060
It was because of work. I understand.

96
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,130
And I came because I want to see you.

97
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,330
I can handle waiting.

98
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,570
What am I?

99
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,350
What am I?

100
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,450
How can you always be patient
with me like this?

101
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,120
How can you keep saying that it's okay?

102
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,160
It's not okay.

103
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,530
This is hard on you.

104
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,370
Remember what I told you before?

105
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,900
Whether I fall or crash,

106
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,840
all I want to do is to be with you.

107
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,320
Yes, it's hard.

108
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,620
I'm upset at you sometimes,

109
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,560
or I go crazy missing you.

110
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,860
But we have to endure this to be together.

111
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,990
At least we still get to see each other.

112
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,130
We've come this far.

113
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,300
Let's bear with it just a bit more.

114
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,870
Hmm?

115
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,540
Is it right to endure?

116
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,420
Senior Yoon.

117
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,860
This is it.

118
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,020
I think we should end this.

119
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,860
Senior Yoon.

120
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Let's end this.

121
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,600
We're interviewing the members
of the marketing team.

122
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,360
I was told to find you
for the overseas team.

123
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,270
Please wait inside the conference room.

124
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Okay.

125
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,090
I forgot you were still waiting.

126
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,520
You two were in the same team, right?

127
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,460
Yes.

128
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,890
Please stay here for a moment.

129
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,390
You're here for the interview?

130
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,090
Yes.

131
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,670
I'm returning to HQ today.

132
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,140
I think I'll be assigned to marketing.

133
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,340
But I'm not sure which team yet.

134
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
I see.

135
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,560
We can't avoid each other completely.

136
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,660
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

137
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,800
I don't feel uncomfortable.

138
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,340
Manager Chae, we'll start with you.
Let's go.

139
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Okay.

140
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,630
It was only a season after we broke up.

141
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,100
I understood what Hyun-seung meant.

142
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,310
Whether you fall or crash,

143
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,000
whatever happens,

144
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,670
all you have to do is
to hold on your partner.

145
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,880
It was wonderful just
being able to love him.

146
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,040
I didn't know what a blessing
it was back then.

147
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,550
I was a fool.

148
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,050
You just had a different idea about love.

149
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,530
You thought letting him go
was the right thing to do.

150
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,030
That was what I thought then.

151
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,740
But now I understand.

152
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,510
I just want to see him.

153
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,370
If I could do that,

154
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,110
I'd be so happy.

155
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,240
You still have feelings for him.

156
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,640
You think you can handle seeing him?

157
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,730
I have to.

158
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,260
You're not going to tell him how you feel?

159
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,690
I was harsh when I
broke things off with him.

160
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
How can I be so shameless?

161
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm already being selfish
by coming back to stay near him.

162
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,830
How dare I ask for more?

163
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,350
Did you get over jet lag?

164
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,450
Yes, I'm doing okay.

165
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,350
Then it's time to get back to work.

166
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,490
Show us what you've learned in Europe.

167
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,020
I heard from Director Lee.

168
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,890
You're open to working on any team.

169
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,330
Any team with a vacancy.

170
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,560
Okay then.

171
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,870
Are you okay with the KLAR Team?

172
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,470
We have a vacancy right now.

173
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,110
Well...

174
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,040
For your information,

175
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,410
I already discussed this
with Manager Chae.

176
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,850
He said he's okay with it.

177
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,310
Song-ah.

178
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,120
I mean, Manager Yoon.

179
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,020
If it's too hard for you,

180
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,520
we'll get someone from another team.

181
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,150
And then you can fill in their vacancy.

182
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,920
So no pressure.

183
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,360
But I hope you'd return to our team.

184
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Wait, no.

185
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,930
Think about it.

186
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,260
Really, no pressure.

187
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,330
Okay, I'll think about it.

188
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,870
Let me see. Ah!

189
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,140
What about the master bedroom wallpaper?

190
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,680
Should we do a different color
on one wall?

191
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,540
That sounds nice.

192
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,950
Okay.

193
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,810
What color should it be?

194
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,880
White is the basic color.

195
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
How about gray?

196
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,490
It'll look modern.

197
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,890
No.

198
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,790
Gray's too simple.

199
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,290
How about a more vivid color?

200
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,160
That sounds nice too.

201
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,230
How about black?

202
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,730
That's fine.

203
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,100
Am I getting married by myself?

204
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,109
I wasn't going to say anything

205
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,440
because I didn't want to look petty.

206
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,250
But how can you do this to me?

207
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,150
I know you're busy,

208
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,380
but we're getting married.

209
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,710
How can you not be interested
about our future home?

210
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,490
Well...

211
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,520
You're so good at everything.

212
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,359
But this will be our home.

213
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,790
It should reflect your taste too.

214
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,000
You are my taste.

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,570
So what you like is what I like.

216
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,560
You're all talk.

217
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,430
Forget it. We'll live in a cave.

218
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,170
Who cares about the wallpaper?

219
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,270
Where are you going?

220
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,930
Hyo-joo will be here soon.

221
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,980
We need to discuss the wedding photoshoot.

222
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,950
I'm going to throw away the wallpaper.

223
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
Hey.

224
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,890
Jae-woon!

225
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,860
Where are you going?

226
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,300
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>

227
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Jae-woon is not picking up.

228
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,170
You should've just gone along with him.

229
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,060
That's exactly what I did.

230
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,940
He sulks a lot.

231
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,350
I told you to reconsider this marriage.

232
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,410
You could break it off.

233
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,110
Hyo-joo!

234
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,850
I guess you don't want to.

235
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,790
What in the world do you see in him?

236
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,460
He's my type.

237
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,790
Yikes.

238
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,320
I feel bad though.

239
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,730
You came all the way here.

240
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,760
Don't worry.

241
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,720
I'll charge it as an expense.

242
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,670
Okay.

243
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,270
Overcharge your brother.

244
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,470
Right,

245
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,110
how did the blind date go?

246
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,880
Was it okay?

247
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,910
The blind date?

248
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,310
It was just...

249
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,420
You look like you've been doing well.

250
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,290
I've been doing great myself too.

251
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,560
I can tell.

252
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,400
Once a jerk, always a jerk.

253
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
It was that awful?

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,340
Yes, I realized he was awful.

255
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,280
Call me when you two make up.

256
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,410
I'll see myself out.

257
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,750
{\an8}CEO LEE JAE-SHIN

258
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,520
Sir.

259
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,350
They said they'd call at 3 p.m., right?

260
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,040
30 minutes have passed.

261
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,100
{\an8}MD KIM JU-YOUNG

262
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,670
Hello?

263
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,310
Okay.

264
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,150
Thank you.

265
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,280
Are we getting a spot?

266
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,050
Yes!

267
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,260
We're finally getting an offline spot.

268
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,940
Congratulations, sir.

269
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,090
Congratulations to all of us.

270
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,600
But let's party later.

271
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,850
We have a lot to prepare.

272
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,200
How about a meeting first?

273
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,470
Welcome back, Manager Yoon.

274
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,930
You were just an employee three years ago,

275
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,270
and now you are a general manager.

276
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,210
I'm happy to join this team again.

277
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,310
I'll work extra hard.

278
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,510
Don't worry.

279
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,310
BM Kwon works us like slaves
since his promotion.

280
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,810
There's no choice but to work hard.

281
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,550
Come on, Manager Kang.

282
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,750
How come you always say the right thing?

283
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,980
She's right, Song-ah.

284
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,250
You better stay sharp.

285
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,820
Okay.

286
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,860
You already know everyone here.

287
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,330
So no need to introduce yourself.

288
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,990
Let's have a company BBQ dinner soon

289
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,550
and catch up on things.

290
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,730
Great.

291
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,960
Right.

292
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,530
About your desk, Manager Yoon.

293
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,870
You can use your old one.

294
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Okay.

295
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,410
Do what you need to do in the morning.

296
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,640
We'll have a meeting in the afternoon.

297
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,010
Give her a round of applause.

298
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,650
Welcome back!

299
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,280
Can I see the two of you
in the meeting room later?

300
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,320
Okay.

301
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Okay.

302
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,540
It's been a while, right?

303
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,440
You must be sad to see Myung-jin go.

304
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,880
You trained him and now
he's off to basic skincare.

305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,180
It's okay.

306
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
You took over the work he was doing?

307
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,550
Yes.

308
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,390
Give some of your work to Manager Yoon.

309
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,230
You can discuss
the task distribution yourselves.

310
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,560
Okay.

311
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,700
I have another meeting to get to.

312
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,100
Let me know what you decide on,
Manager Yoon.

313
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,270
Okay.

314
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,510
-See you later.
-Alright.

315
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,650
Gosh!

316
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,160
What is it?

317
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,950
How did they look? Do they look okay?

318
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,660
Yes, they seemed okay.

319
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,480
Really?

320
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,760
I guess they handled it nicely.

321
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,990
They agreed to be on the same team.

322
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,970
I'm sure they are professional.

323
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,770
I'm so relieved.

324
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,140
I couldn't sleep last night
because I was so worried.

325
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,640
That's overreacting.

326
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,680
Anyway, I'm glad we don't have to worry.

327
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,880
This is why you dragged me here?

328
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,090
Yes.

329
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,020
What in the world?

330
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,760
At least get me a cup of coffee first.

331
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,710
How do you want to divide the tasks?

332
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,340
Is there a list?

333
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,480
Here.

334
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,180
Do you want to discuss it now?

335
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,790
I have time.

336
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,360
Just check the ones you want to take.

337
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,150
I'll give you the documents
of the related information.

338
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,760
Okay, that sounds good.

339
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,730
I'll get going first.

340
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,650
This is a shared kitchen used by
self-employed restaurateurs.

341
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,870
I see.

342
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,320
You mean delivery-only cuisine?

343
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,660
That's right.

344
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,660
You'll use this place
for the cooking class.

345
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,470
Have you come up with a curriculum?

346
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,700
Not yet.

347
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm not sure what to do.

348
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,470
Don't worry. I can help you with that.

349
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,410
I have some samples.

350
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,540
Or I can make you a customized one too.

351
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,640
Thank you.

352
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,550
I've always wanted to do this,
but I didn't know where to start.

353
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,390
Having you here makes things easier.

354
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,260
Please spread the word about me then.

355
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Sure.

356
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,220
Want to see more?

357
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,230
Sure.

358
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,000
Woo-hyun.

359
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,700
<i>I'm going to pick up Ha-eun.</i>

360
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,810
When do you think you'll be done?

361
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,770
I have another meeting. I'll be home late.

362
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,440
Don't worry. Do your thing.

363
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,540
I'll go get Ha-eun.

364
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Okay.

365
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,240
I'm good, aren't I?

366
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,020
Stay focused.

367
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,350
You'll cut yourself.

368
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,590
Okay.

369
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,360
Be careful.

370
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,400
I want a lot of this.

371
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,370
Why?

372
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,540
Because I need my protein.

373
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,780
Okay.

374
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,770
Happy?

375
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,680
More.

376
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,850
-More?
-Yes.

377
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,650
I think this is enough protein.

378
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,650
No, it's not.

379
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,490
-It's enough.
-More.

380
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,020
-I need more.
-I think it's enough.

381
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,420
Then buy a lot more when
it's your turn to cook again.

382
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,960
Huh? That much?

383
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,850
All done.

384
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,230
Thank you for the food, Daddy.

385
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,430
You're welcome.

386
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,100
How is it?

387
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,040
Is it good?

388
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,480
It's not that good.

389
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,940
But it's edible.

390
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,150
You're improving, Daddy.

391
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,250
I'll do better next time.

392
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,250
Okay.

393
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,290
How was school? Did you have fun?

394
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,580
What is it? Something happened?

395
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,800
You know Ye-ji in my class?

396
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Yes.

397
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,200
Her parents are getting a divorce.

398
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,570
Really?

399
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,630
Yes, that's why she cried today.

400
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,580
She must be so sad.

401
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,410
Um.

402
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,650
So what did you tell her?

403
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,920
I just gave her a hug.

404
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,520
We can't do anything
about a grown-up thing.

405
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,550
Say this to Ye-ji then.

406
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,320
Even if they get a divorce,

407
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,560
they will always love Ye-ji.

408
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,260
That will never change.

409
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,240
You still have some work left?

410
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,740
Yes.

411
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,550
I didn't get to greet you properly before.

412
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm glad we're on the same team.

413
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,920
Let's get in.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,570
Manager Yoon.

415
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,230
I don't know if I should say this.

416
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,470
But Hyun-seung took
your breakup really hard.

417
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,270
After you two ended things,

418
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,410
he was in a really bad place.

419
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,780
He was worse than you think.

420
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,920
-So...
-Se-rim.

421
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,650
I know what you're worried about.

422
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,490
But it won't happen. Don't worry.

423
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,660
I'm sorry.

424
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,400
See you tomorrow.

425
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,780
You can't change it at the last minute.

426
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,850
Alright then.

427
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,980
Let's go for the product photoshoot.

428
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,690
We can't do that today.

429
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,850
Why not?

430
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,420
I just got a call.

431
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,560
The studio is having issues
with its equipment.

432
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,330
They said they can't fix it today.

433
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,030
How long will it take then?

434
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,500
They said it's going to take a week.

435
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,930
I think we need to find another studio.

436
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,970
Can we find one on such short notice?

437
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,800
Still, let's start making some calls.

438
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,710
Okay.

439
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,300
I have a photographer friend.

440
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,640
I'll call their studio.

441
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,080
Okay.

442
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,880
-I'll make some calls too.
-Okay.

443
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,690
This is the studio?

444
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,700
Yes, my friend works at this place.

445
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,600
We got lucky. They're free today.

446
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,260
Is your friend Lee Hyo-joo?

447
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,790
Huh? Who is that?

448
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,110
You said your friend works here.

449
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,440
Oh, my friend is an assistant here.

450
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,010
She got permission from the director here.

451
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,250
Let's go inside.

452
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,300
Are you here to see me?

453
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,470
We have a photoshoot today.

454
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,840
I didn't know we scheduled it with you.

455
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,370
You're the urgent photoshoot?

456
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,340
Can we use your space?

457
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,810
Have a great one.

458
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,300
Is that the new cushion foundation?

459
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,910
It's not finished yet.
This is just a sample for customers.

460
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,710
I've put a lot of work into that.

461
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,970
I tested it many times on my face.

462
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,380
I see.

463
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,850
So that's why it came out so nice.

464
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,050
Good work.

465
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,250
Thank you.

466
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,650
You know...

467
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
You can address me comfortably.

468
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,660
In due time.

469
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,290
Alright.

470
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,130
Manager Yoon,

471
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,390
we need to visit some stores.

472
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay.

473
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,990
We're doing a survey
on our base makeup line

474
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,170

477
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,840
Okay.

478
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,820
Do you feel a cooling effect?

479
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,120
Please try this.

480
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,990
This one.

481
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
How is it?

482
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,190
It applies very well.

483
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,830
You can check it off
if it brightens your complexion.

These are some samples. Please try them.

Thank you.

Good work today.

490
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,650
You too.

491
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,310
It's late enough. Want to have dinner?

492
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,690
No, I'll be leaving now.

493
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay.

494
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,200
See you tomorrow.

495
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,880
Sure, see you tomorrow.

Manager Yoon! Over here!

501
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,670
Sit here.

502
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,530
-Hello.
-Look who it is!

503
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,000
Long time no see.

504
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,010
-How have you all been?
-Great.

505
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,810
All of you did a great job today.

506
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,980
Let's drink first.

Cheers!

510
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,880
-You are buying tonight, right?
-Of course. This is the least I can do.

511
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,950
I'm going to eat a lot then.

512
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,010
Thank you.

513
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,220
Hey.

514
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,560
Let me pour you a glass.

515
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,990
Sure.

516
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,800
I'll pour you a glass, Manager Yoon.

517
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,500
But your glass is full.

518
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,930
Right.

519
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,540
Okay, I'll drink.

520
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,210
At the same time.

521
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,130
Cheers!

522
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,640
Thank you.

523
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
It's great to see you.

524
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,710
Can I join you?

525
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,710
It's been a long time.

526
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,980
-I know, right?
-Here.

527
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,750
Cheers!

528
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,220
Good work today.

529
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,090
Really.

530
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,160
There's not enough alcohol.

531
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,290
Are you drunk?

532
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,600
Manager Yoon.

533
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
Hey.

534
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,040
It's Chae Hyun-seung.

535
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,190
I thought you went home.

536
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,290
What are you doing here?

537
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,950
What took you so long?

538
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,790
I've missed you so much.

539
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,260
Right,

540
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,160
I made you leave.

541
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,000
Like a fool.

542
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,570
Let's go.

543
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,210
I'll take you home.

544
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,780
I'm sorry.

545
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,990
I'm sorry I still like you.

546
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,630
I'm really sorry.

547
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,430
Are you alright?

548
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
No.

549
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,740
Jeez.

550
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,870
How much did you drink?

551
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,170
Make sure you take
some medicine before you go.

552
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,510
By the way,

553
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,450
how did I get home yesterday?

554
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,300
You don't remember?

555
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,120
Hyun-seung brought you home.

556
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
What?

557
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,290
Who?

558
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,890
Why?

559
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,430
My thoughts exactly.

560
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,700
Why did he carry you home?

561
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,530
I was so shocked.

562
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Hey!

563
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Did you drunk dial him?

564
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,170
Check your phone.

565
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,210
Darn.

566
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,470
Huh?

567
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,990
You didn't call him.

568
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,480
Then how?

569
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,430
<i>Manager Yoon.</i>

570
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,620
It's Chae Hyun-seung.

571
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,390
What took you so long?

572
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,900
I've missed you so much.

573
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,490
<i>I'm sorry I still like you.</i>

574
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,430
I'm really sorry.

575
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,070
Gosh.

576
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,910
Oh, my gosh!

577
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,510
What am I going to do?

578
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,510
What?

579
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,120
I must be crazy!

580
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,310
-Good morning.
-Morning.

581
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
-Good morning.
-Morning.

582
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,840
Good morning.

583
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,210
Good morning.

584
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,400
What do you think, sir?

585
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,240
Don't they look much better
than the other ones?

586
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,870
What happened?

587
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,470
Did you ask for a reshoot?

588
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,780
I heard the director saw
the assistant's work

589
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,210
and criticized her.

590
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,080
Then she redid the whole shoot herself.

591
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,580
She's a big-shot photographer.

592
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,420
The quality alone proves it.

593
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,520
The products came out really nice.

594
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,000
This is Lee Hyo-joo.

595
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,270
<i>It's me, Lee Jae-shin.</i>

596
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,140
What's up?

597
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,170
I saw the product photos.

598
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,480
Oh, those photos?

599
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,940
I redid them because my assistant
didn't do justice.

600
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,310
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

601
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,620
You know I'm a perfectionist.

602
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Thank you.

603
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,950
I want to repay this debt.

604
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,890
You don't have to.

605
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,890
But if you want, you can buy me lunch.

606
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,460
When's good for you?

607
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,850
How about today?

608
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,010
You must've been really thankful.

609
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,750
I know it's uncomfortable for you.

610
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,110
I picked a nice place,

611
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,620
but it's probably not what you're used to.

612
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,510
But their food is good.

613
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,630
Isn't this a must-eat place?

614
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,680
Why? Surprised that I know about it?

615
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,900
You think I only
eat at luxury restaurants?

616
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,570
Are you serious?

617
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,840
I'm not some princess.

618
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,540
I'll eat kimbap if I get off work late.

619
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,140
I'll have fried chicken and beer
with my coworkers too.

620
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,480
I never asked you to take me
to some fancy places.

621
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,650
All I asked for was to be with you.

622
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,960
You're right.

623
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,790
Your food is here.

624
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,830
Thank you.

625
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,930
Enjoy your meal.

626
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,200
Thanks for the food.

627
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,860
About yesterday...

628
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,730
Thanks for taking care of me.

629
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,030
And I'm sorry.

630
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,530
I shouldn't have said that.

631
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,280
I'm not completely over you,

632
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,210
even though I tried to hide it.

633
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,220
But you don't have to worry.

634
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,620
I won't bother you anymore.

635
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,860
Alright.

636
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,360
You're still here?

637
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,500
Hey.

638
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,800
Who is making my brother-in-law
work overtime?

639
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
This is unacceptable!

640
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,500
They're all gone.

641
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,540
How is Ji-seung?

642
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,440
You got in a fight again?

643
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,840
No.

644
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,590
It's just me sulking.

645
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,050
You have to stay longer?

646
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,850
Want to eat with me?

647
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,950
Not dinner.

648
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,990
How about a drink?

649
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,930
You said you were fine
with working with her again.

650
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,400
So I thought you were okay.

651
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,600
I thought it'd be okay,

652
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,260
but it wasn't.

653
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,180
It was hard not seeing her,

654
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,680
and it's hard seeing her.

655
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,580
It's been a year, right?

656
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,820
A year could be long or short.

657
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,830
But it's not enough to get over someone.

658
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,850
So how do you feel?

659
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,280
Will you be okay working with her?

660
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,030
I'm not sure yet.

661
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,330
In that case,

662
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,630
give it some time.

663
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,670
What's important is how you feel.

664
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,300
Focus on that.

665
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,310
Okay.

666
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,650
-Manager Yoo.
-Yes?

667
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,590
I'm going to drop by the Sales Team.

668
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,760
We'll visit some new stores,

669
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,160
so it's going to take a while.

670
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,830
Go home right away if it's too late.

671
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,630
Okay, I'll call you.

672
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,370
Thank you!

673
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,900
-Have mine too.
-Thanks, Hyun-seung.

674
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,340
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

675
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,390
<i>this is an announcement
about the fire drill</i>

676
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,240
<i>to be conducted by the Safety Team.</i>

677
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,080
Wow, the announcement is loud today.

678
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,140
I know, right?

679
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,020
<i>Based on Article No. 25
regarding fire prevention,</i>

680
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,690
<i>fire fighting equipment
installation and maintenance,</i>

681
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,420
<i>we will conduct
a comprehensive fire drill</i>

682
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,210
<i>from 8 p.m. to midnight.</i>

683
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,360
This announcement reminds me
of someone I know.

684
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,500
Who is it?

685
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,230
He was with his girlfriend for six years.

686
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,930
They were at a concert
when the fire alarm went off.

687
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,480
But nobody moves instantly

688
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,510
because it could just be a drill.

689
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,470
Right.

690
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,830
He was wondering what it was,

691
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,280
and they were told to evacuate.

692
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,130
Then there really was a fire.

693
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,150
Yes.

694
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,850
So he turned to his side
to grab his girlfriend,

695
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,850
so that they could get out.

696
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:54,880
But she wasn't there.

697
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,620
She'd already run for her life?

698
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,720
Yes.

699
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,390
He looked for her,

700
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,060
and she was down near the entrance.

701
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,590
So? What happened between them?

702
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,060
He broke up with her that day.

703
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,160
She left him at a dire moment like that.

704
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,500
He saw her true colors.

705
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,690
He was going to marry her though.

706
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,930
Good for him.

707
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,600
This is why a couple
has to experience a crisis.

708
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,410
Words are no use.

709
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,400
Your actions show who you are.

710
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,010
How could she do that after six years?

711
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,760
Whether she loved him or not,

712
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,210
she's probably a heartless person.

713
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,640
Let's say it happens to you.

714
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,590
Will you grab your husband and run?

715
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,950
Of course.

716
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,350
Wait. You're not going to?

717
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,720
Of course, I will.

718
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,930
But I know my wife won't.

719
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,390
She doesn't even cook for me these days.

720
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,770
Don't be sad.

721
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,740
We'll take good care of you.

722
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,780
This is making me sadder.

723
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,740
Thanks, Hyun-seung.

724
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,210
Let's join hands.

725
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,960
You're leaving now?

726
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Yes.

727
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,430
Why are you here at this hour?

728
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,630
I left something at the office.

729
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,530
Bye then.

730
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,530
Bye.

731
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,640
<i>Attention!</i>

732
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,460
<i>A fire emergency has been reported
in the building.</i>

733
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,390
<i>Proceed to the nearest emergency exit.</i>

734
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,950
<i>Do not use elevators.</i>

735
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,310
<i>Walk down the stairwells
to the ground floor.</i>

736
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,220
Let's go!

737
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,290
What?

738
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,280
Hurry!

739
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,400
Manager Yoon!

740
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,620
Hurry up!

741
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,570
Senior Yoon!

742
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,830
What?

743
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,540
It's a fire drill.

744
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,540
What?

745
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,850
They're doing a system check.
It's not a fire.

746
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,700
I'm sorry.

747
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,060
I didn't know about that.

748
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,470
I'll get going then.

749
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,210
I have to go up.

750
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,780
Sorry.

751
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,190
Is my life that important?

752
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,340
At least you're not heartless.

753
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,450
I'm other things, too.

754
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,780
Goodbye then.

755
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,900
How was today's meeting?

756
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,070
It went well.

757
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,440
The chef liked the curriculum I set up.

758
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,580
Nice.

759
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,880
Aren't you tired?

760
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,980
It's not easy dealing with people.

761
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,220
Sometimes there's a difficult client,

762
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,620
but it's mostly fun.

763
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,350
I'm getting more clients too.

764
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,490
Don't overwork yourself.

765
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,380
I know. I'm doing this because it's fun.

766
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,740
Yeon-seung,

767
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,000
do you want to go on a trip?

768
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,130
A trip?

769
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,610
Does Ha-eun want to go somewhere?

770
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,200
Not with her. Just the two of us.

771
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,610
The two of us?

772
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Sure.

773
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,850
Let's go where you want then.

774
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,660
Okay.

775
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,530
{\an8}AMICABLE DIVORCE APPLICATION FORM

776
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,540
<i>I'll be by your side.</i>

777
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,710
Until you can accept yourself
just as you are.

778
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,210
Just until then.

779
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,780
Let's go!

780
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,720
Huh?

781
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,710
Hurry!

782
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,400
<i>I'm not completely over you.</i>

783
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,600
Even though I tried to hide it.

784
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,320
I'm other things, too.

785
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,580
<i>I'm sorry I still like you.</i>

786
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,980
<i>So how do you feel?</i>

787
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,070
Hold it. Sorry.

788
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,100
Hello.

789
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,780
I'm sorry.

790
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,810
Excuse me.

791
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,490
Wait!

792
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,640
I'm sorry.

793
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,670
{\an8}KLAR FACTORY 1

794
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,940
Please make modifications
to the renewed products

795
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,550
as we discussed earlier.

796
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,810
When can we get the fixed samples?

797
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,380
Sometime next week?

798
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,050
Wednesday, I think.

799
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,040
Okay.

800
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,360
It won't change much, will it?

801
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,370
Do we have to do another
container suitability test?

802
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:44,310
There are some changes
to the ingredients, so we should.

803
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,780
That won't affect
our production timeline, will it?

804
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,510
It won't, as long as everything's
decided this month.

805
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,280
We'll be sure to do that.

806
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,230
Okay.

807
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,620
You're leaving right away?

808
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,880
It's dinner time soon. Let's go eat.

809
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,060
That sounds good.

810
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,730
What about you?

811
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,460
We need to go back in.

812
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,000
We still have work to do.

813
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,900
I'm sorry.

814
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,370
Alright. Bye then.

815
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:11,900
Thank you.

816
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,800
Good work.

817
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,070
-See you.
-Thank you.

818
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,570
Good work. Safe travels.

819
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,690
Okay.

820
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,120
You want me to drop you off at the office?

821
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,160
Yes.

822
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,880
Can we stop by somewhere first?

823
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,760
Here you go.

824
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,630
Thank you.

825
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,170
Have a good day.

826
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,890
Here.

827
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,460
Seems like you're having an upset stomach.

828
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,960
Thank you.

829
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,670
I can drive if that's okay with you.

830
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,920
If this is how you act,

831
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,620
can you still hide your feelings?

832
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,440
You said you won't bother me.

833
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,350
You're being selfish.

834
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,020
If you're going to act this way,

835
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,190
go ahead.

836
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,190
Try to win me over, Yoon Song-ah.

837
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:29,509
SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW

838
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,730
<i>I like you.</i>

839
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:31,770
<i>I like you, Hyun-seung.</i>

840
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,840
<i>This is so random.</i>

841
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,130
<i>This is for you only.</i>

842
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,050
<i>-It's mine.
-What is it?</i>

843
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,820
<i>Mine.</i>

844
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,439
<i>To show that I'm serious.</i>

845
01:00:37,439 --> 01:00:42,240
<i>I know I can't always win in love
even when I've given it my all.</i>

846
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,790
<i>So I'm scared.</i>

847
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:46,780
<i>I'm sorry I hurt you.</i>

848
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,980
<i>I love you so much.</i>

849
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,000
<i>I really missed you, too.</i>

850
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,920
<i>Don't ever go anywhere.</i>

851
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,090
<i>I am against it.</i>

852
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,260
<i>I can't live without him. I just can't.</i>
