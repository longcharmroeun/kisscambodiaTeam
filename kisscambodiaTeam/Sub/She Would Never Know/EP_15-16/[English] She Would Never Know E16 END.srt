1
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:11,694
ALL PLACES, CHARACTERS, FIRMS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,740
If this is how you act,

3
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,470
can you still hide your feelings?

4
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,320
You said you won't bother me.

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,300
You're being selfish.

6
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,270
If you're going to act this way,

7
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,880
go ahead.

8
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,650
Try to win me over, Yoon Song-ah.

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,050
What should I do?

10
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,320
There are many nice women out there.

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,780
So listen to my advice, gentlemen.

12
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,310
Learn how to see beneath the surface.

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,890
Stop acting foolishly.

14
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,579
That's all for today!

15
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,590
Bye.

16
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,329
So stupid.

17
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,710
Oh, my gosh!

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,710
You done?

19
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,610
You scared the heck out of me!

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,210
What?

21
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,850
What?

22
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,020
You want tips on how to seduce a man?

23
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,579
Yes.

24
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,570
What for?

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,120
Is this about Hyun-seung?

26
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,720
Yes.

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
Oh, my gosh!

28
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,890
So what do I have to do?

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,890
Come on now.

30
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,500
There are many ways to do it.

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,170
Is that so?

32
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,620
But those tricks aren't really important.

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,740
What moves a person is your sincerity.

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,840
When you like someone,
you want to take care of them.

35
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,580
Don't you think it's best
to be genuine like that?

36
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:31,022
FINAL EPISODE

37
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,430
Hi.

38
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Hello.

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,350
Let's get on.

40
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,470
Are you feeling better?

41
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,440
Yes. Thank you.

42
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,210
I'm glad to hear that.

43
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,320
I like you.

44
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,190
I like you, Hyun-seung.

45
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,430
This is so random.

46
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,570
Have a great day.

47
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,020
That's a lot.

48
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,550
It's for our office, right?

49
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,740
This is for you only.

50
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,870
It's not that sweet.

51
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,540
Okay. Please call me back.

52
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,810
Okay.

53
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,210
Hello.

54
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,410
-Coffee?
-Yes.

55
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,410
Later.

56
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,480
Can I get a cup of coffee?

57
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,190
What's that?

58
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,010
What?

59
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,020
What is it?

60
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,390
Mine.

61
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,660
But what is it?

62
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,760
It's mine!

63
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,600
This is yours.

64
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,130
The weather is good today.

65
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,730
Is it?

66
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,800
Hot!

67
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,580
You're not going home?

68
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,440
I have a bit more work left.

69
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,310
You want me to bring you something to eat?

70
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,970
No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

71
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,950
Okay then.

72
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,020
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

73
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,150
Let's go home. Good work today.

74
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,520
Good work.

75
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,159
-Down for a BBQ?
-Sounds great.

76
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,090
Goodbye.

77
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,920
Donâ€™t stay too long.

78
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,530
Okay. Goodbye.

79
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,560
He's working hard.

80
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,890
-Let's go for BBQ.
-BBQ is delicious.

81
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,070
He says it's his treat.

82
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,430
Over here!

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Hello.

84
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,330
You like fried chicken, right?

85
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:00,021
HOT PEPPER AND MAYO CHICKEN

86
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,880
It's really delicious.

87
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,300
Maybe it's because I'm eating with you.

88
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,810
Am I doing a good job now?

89
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,580
Trying to win you over.

90
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,840
Why?

91
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,450
Just...

92
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,520
I wonder if I'm doing it right.

93
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,960
I've never done this before.

94
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,429
I guess guys always asked you out.

95
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,400
Mostly, yes.

96
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,200
Why?

97
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,169
Are you jealous?

98
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,740
Of course not. Why would I be jealous?

99
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,440
Anyway, I'm on cloud nine.

100
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,450
You're giving me another chance,

101
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,280
and I can look at you like this again.

102
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,120
I can tell you I like you.

103
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,760
And I can sit with you like this.

104
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,500
Thank you.

105
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,230
You gave me an excuse for this.

106
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,740
I didn't do it for you.

107
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm going to try really hard.

108
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,710
I won't give up.

109
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,310
Here.

110
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,250
My sincerity.

111
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,130
You know drumsticks are the best, right?

112
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,650
You look handsome, as expected!

113
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,020
I wonder who your bride will be.

114
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,060
Are we done now?

115
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,300
Are you going to keep sulking?

116
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm not sulking.

117
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,100
Now that I think about it,

118
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,070
there was no proposal.

119
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,510
Man.

120
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,610
I'm going to do it!

121
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,090
I was really going to do it.

122
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,370
You should've already done it.

123
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,780
The wedding is right around the corner.

124
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,250
It's...

125
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,550
You know I was really busy
planning the wedding.

126
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,220
I wasn't going to skip the proposal.

127
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,280
Feeling bad, right?

128
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,730
Please forgive me.

129
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,790
I felt bad too.

130
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,920
Jae-woon.

131
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Huh?

132
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,130
I'm not as intuitive as you are,

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,510
so I may end up upsetting you again.

134
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,680
But I can promise you.

135
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,110
I'll never make light of your feelings.

136
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,480
So...

137
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,050
If you're upset with me,

138
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,660
you must always tell me.

139
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,460
I'll do my best to make it up to you.

140
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,800
Come on.

141
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,630
You can't just spring this on me.

142
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,620
Huh?

143
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,340
Are you crying?

144
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm not crying.

145
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,470
I don't get emotional easily.

146
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,240
I think you totally do.

147
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't.

148
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,810
-It looks like you're crying.
-I'm not.

149
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,210
I see tears.

150
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,220
Ji-seung.

151
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,850
I promise.

152
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,410
I'll make you the happiest woman on earth.

153
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,260
I love you, Chae Ji-seung!

154
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,750
Stop it.

155
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,530
Don't cry.

156
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,670
You surprised me.

157
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,770
Stop crying.

158
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,180
Next year's F/W collection theme
is "Celebrate for Me".

159
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,640
It's about celebrating yourself.

160
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,980
We will do a limited-edition
eye shadow collection,

161
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,850
highlighter and two lipstick colors.

162
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,950
What about the package design?

163
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,540
Who are you collaborating with?

164
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,730
{\an8}Check Mom's OB/GYN checkup date

165
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,290
I was thinking HARA.

166
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,020
The designer is very hot.

167
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,160
Her schedule is packed a year ahead.

168
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,300
I think she'd be
a great fit for our theme.

169
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Not that she has agreed
to collaborate yet.

170
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,440
HARA is hotta.

171
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Sorry.

172
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,480
Let's contact her and make a pitch.

173
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,340
Okay.

174
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,310
Manager Chae, can you do that?

175
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,580
Okay.

176
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,620
It's weird.

177
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,520
I know.

178
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,250
We always have room for dessert.

179
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,260
That's right.

180
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,760
I could eat another meal
if it were delicious.

181
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,130
Me too.

182
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,930
That place is good.

183
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,160
The new marinated crab restaurant.

184
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,170
I love marinated crabs!

185
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,400
Their food isn't too salty.

186
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
I really like that dish.

187
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,740
Let's go there next time.

188
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,600
Sure.

189
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,940
Let's go tomorrow.

190
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,140
I'm down!

191
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,370
-Excuse me.
-You free tomorrow?

192
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,740
Of course, I am.

193
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
What is it?

194
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,340
What are you doing?

195
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,220
I'm with my friends at my cafe.
What is it?

196
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,550
Didn't you just see them yesterday?

197
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,120
That was singing class.
Today I had aerobic class.

198
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,960
What's the matter?
I have to get back to them.

199
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,060
I think your OB/GYN checkup is coming up.

200
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,700
<i>When did you schedule it for?</i>

201
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,370
When was it?

202
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,700
They will text me when the date is closer.

203
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,940
I'll let you know once I get a text.

204
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,710
Let's talk later.

205
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,750
That was a long phone call.

206
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,380
It was my daughter.

207
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,480
She works at KLAR.

208
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,680
That's why you have nice skin.

209
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,550
Right.

210
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,450
She is one busy lady.

211
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,630
So what about the collaboration?

212
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,460
Do what you want to do.

213
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,500
I didn't tell them you are my sister.

214
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,400
You can do a meeting if you're interested,

215
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,530
or you can just turn it down.

216
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,570
It sounds fun.

217
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,100
But let me think about it first.

218
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,110
Okay.

219
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,110
How is work these days?

220
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,450
Nothing much is going on.

221
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,320
Jae-woon told me.

222
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,890
Song-ah is back.

223
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,660
Ah, he told you?

224
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,060
Are you okay?

225
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,830
You know what?

226
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,790
I've become a coward.

227
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,510
She wants to get back together.

228
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,380
I want that too.

229
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,020
But now I know I can't always win in love

230
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,820
even when I've given it my all.

231
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,310
So I'm scared.

232
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,830
If she leaves me again...

233
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,170
I wasn't going to say anything.

234
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,110
This is all Jae-woon's fault.

235
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,910
My adorable Jae-woon?

236
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,680
Ew! Adorable?

237
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,710
Love is terrifying.

238
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,030
Eat.

239
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,120
I didn't bring an umbrella.

240
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,320
You didn't drive here?

241
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,460
I took a taxi.

242
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,090
Take this.

243
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,630
What about you?

244
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm not far from here.

245
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,080
You can keep it.

246
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,530
Here.

247
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Bye.

248
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,410
Why are you so nervous?

249
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,050
She's your sister.

250
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
She'll probably hate me.

251
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,050
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

252
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,740
Consult took forever.

253
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,030
Hello.

254
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,590
Long time no see.

255
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:10,612
KLAR INTRODUCTION

256
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,470
The collaboration design
will go on the containers,

257
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,140
packages and any PR items.

258
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,240
We haven't decided on
what those items will be.

259
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,210
I've only designed dresses,

260
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,080
so I have no idea where to start.

261
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,910
Our design team will be there as support.

262
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,850
They'll offer guidance if you need any.

263
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,690
Sorry, I have to take this.

264
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Yes?

265
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,670
Can I talk about something personal?

266
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,610
Sure.

267
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,050
There are people who face things head-on.

268
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,400
But when they experience true fear,

269
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,620
they tend to step back.

270
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,790
They could give everything

271
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,830
because they used to be fearless.

272
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,330
But that crumbled. So they're scared now.

273
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,200
If the same situation
were to happen again,

274
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,500
they know there's nothing they can do now.

275
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,610
Some people are less stubborn
than they look.

276
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,910
They get hurt more than you think.

277
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,760
<i>Don't go, Song-ah.</i>

278
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,130
I want to go, Hyun-seung.

280
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,970
Is it right to endure?

281
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,410
Song-ah.

282
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,780
This is it.

283
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
I think we should end this.

284
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,150
<i>Hyun-seung took your
breakup really hard.</i>

285
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,950
<i>After you two ended things,</i>

286
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,890
<i>he was in a really bad place.</i>

287
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,490
<i>He was worse than you think.</i>

288
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,530
<i>There are people
who face things head-on.</i>

289
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,290
<i>When they experience true fear,</i>

290
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,640
<i>they tend to step back.</i>

291
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,340
<i>If the same situation
were to happen again,</i>

292
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,940
<i>they know there's nothing they can do.</i>

293
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,240
Do you have to go back to the office?

294
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,820
If not, I'll go straight
to the office dinner.

295
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,350
Okay, that's fine.

296
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,830
Cheers.

297
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,130
Good job, everyone.

298
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,940
Especially the color makeup team.

299
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,310
Thanks for your work
with the base makeup renewal.

300
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,270
All the items are getting good reviews.

301
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,340
We won't have to worry
about the sales this month.

302
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,210
Can I order more beef then?

303
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,450
You're working basic skincare.

304
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,970
I tested a lot of samples.

305
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,850
Me too.

306
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,280
I'm ordering more.

307
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
Two more servings
of chuck flap tail, please.

308
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,890
Okay.

309
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,590
Haven't you already eaten a whole cow?

310
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,660
Can I ask you something?

311
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,660
How is it working in Europe?

312
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,290
Why? Are you interested?

313
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,100
I want to be sent overseas to work too.

314
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,330
That's why you're sitting next to her,

315
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,750
and not Hyun-seung.

316
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,240
I think it's a good experience.

317
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,180
Right, the place where I used to
work is recruiting soon.

318
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Really?

319
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,550
But now isn't a good time.

320
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,210
You need to go when there's an open spot.

321
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,720
They don't come around often.

322
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,580
I want to go, but it's my girlfriend.

323
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,890
She said she'd never do long-distance.

324
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,460
She'd rather break up.

325
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,790
So I want to go after I get married.

326
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,220
Europe is just too far away.

327
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,560
Long-distance won't last long.

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Myung-jin, stop talking.

329
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,770
Try this pepper. It's sweet.

330
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,980
-Good?
-Sir!

331
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,620
It's not hot for me.

332
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,620
Wow, this is really hot.

333
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,220
I told you, don't just eat anything!

334
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,120
Here, drink this.

335
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,450
Hot!

336
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,200
Are you okay?

337
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,070
No.

338
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,970
Is your stomach better?

339
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,040
No.

340
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,720
I think it's paralyzed.

341
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,410
Let's go home now.

342
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,680
Have a good weekend. See you Monday.

343
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,440
-Okay.
-Bye.

344
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,580
Have a good weekend.

345
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,150
-Let's go.
-Okay.

346
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,720
Are you taking a taxi?

347
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,920
Get home safely.

348
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,950
-Have a great weekend.
-Bye.

349
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,630
I didn't drink. I'll drive you home.

350
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,190
Before you do that...

351
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,420
Can we talk a bit?

352
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,200
Don't worry about what Myung-jin said.

353
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
It's fine.

354
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,810
I'm making you say it again.

355
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,780
That everything is fine.

356
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,790
And I'm apologizing yet again.

357
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,730
I'm sorry I hurt you.

359
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,600
I knew it would be hard,

360
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,100
but I didn't fully realize

361
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,500
how much you were hurting.

362
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,810
I'm really sorry.

363
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,750
So?

364
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,150
Are you going to give up now?

365
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,090
No.

366
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,420
I'm saying...

367
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,830
I hope I can make you feel better.

368
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,900
I came back because I missed you so much.

369
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,140
I didn't want to be there anymore.

370
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,940
I missed your face
and I missed your voice.

371
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,680
I don't care how long it takes

372
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,350
if I can make it up to you.

373
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,450
If you give me another chance,

374
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,520
I'll never ever do anything stupid.

375
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,630
Like hurting you again.

376
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,010
Senior Yoon,

377
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,250
can I kiss you?

378
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,030
Let's go back to my place.

379
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,270
What?

380
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,410
I love you.

381
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,380
So much.

382
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,010
Not as much as I do.

383
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,080
I love you.

384
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,380
Still handsome, aren't I?

385
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,580
You're awake?

386
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,000
I've wanted to tell you this before.

387
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,090
You're beautiful.

388
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,810
I'm happy.

389
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,910
Me too.

390
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,730
I'm hungry.

391
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,400
You really know how to cook?

392
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
This is too easy.

393
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,910
You're like a chef.

394
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,910
Right?

395
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,180
Salt to taste.

396
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,780
Looks good.

397
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,850
The toast is done.

398
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,650
Where are you going?

399
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,720
Stick next to me.

400
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,220
I'm right here.

401
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,560
You have to stick next to me.

402
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,490
Come on.

403
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,490
We said we'd stick to each other.

404
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,470
Hey!

405
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,870
We said...

406
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,000
Come here!

407
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,310
Stop messing around.

408
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,910
Let's eat.

409
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,470
Can you drop me off over there?

410
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,140
Over there?

411
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,800
Yes, ma'am.

412
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,380
See you later.

413
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,040
See you later.

414
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,050
Good morning.

415
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,420
Good morning.

416
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,140
Morning.

417
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,860
Here, Manager Yoon.

418
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,720
Thank you, Manager Chae.

419
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,750
Yeon-seung.

420
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,120
Yes?

421
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,430
You told me that whoever I am,

422
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,460
I will just be myself to you.

423
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,860
Nobody's said that to me before.

424
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,970
It has stayed with me
for the past three years.

425
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,410
Whatever or whoever I am,

426
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,780
there's someone who
accepts me just as I am.

427
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,850
I had always felt suffocated,

428
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,950
but you kind of freed me by saying that.

429
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,010
Thank you.

430
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,100
For being my safe place.

431
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,040
I haven't fully accepted myself yet,

432
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,710
but I think I have the courage to try now.

433
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,250
I'm ready to try facing it alone.

434
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,150
Alright.

435
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,000
If that's what you want.

436
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,960
And Ha-eun...

437
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,730
Ha-eun is going to take it hard.

438
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,900
I don't know how to tell her either.

439
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,540
No matter what we say, it'll hurt her.

440
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,710
I only want the best for her.

441
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,720
It might take long,
but we have to give her enough time.

442
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,720
So that she can accept it.

443
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,460
It might not hurt as much.

444
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,310
Ha-eun.

445
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,550
Ha-eun?

446
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,010
I brought your favorite mango cake.

447
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,489
Can I go in?

448
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,810
{\an8}Checkup notice for guardian Chae -
First Heart OB/GYN

449
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,270
He can't do anything right.

450
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,180
He's already been here for a year.

451
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,450
I don't understand how he can be so dumb.

452
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,640
My day goes by cleaning up his messes.

453
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,580
That never happened when I was a trainee.

454
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,260
Hyun-seung,

455
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,500
he forgot his clumsy newbie days.

456
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,370
You don't know the real reason
why your trainer quit.

457
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,470
It was because of his trainee,
which was you.

458
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,210
Who is spreading such a rumor?

459
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,060
Who said that?

460
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,300
Who said that?

461
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,850
I have to go.

462
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,090
You always leave when I'm talking.

463
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,660
Manager Yoon!

464
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,600
I don't get it.

465
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,870
They used to be trainer and trainee.
How can they be cordial to each other?

466
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,670
Isn't that impressive?

467
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,640
You're more impressive.

468
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,170
Why?

469
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,570
With such a bad observational skill,

470
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,050
how does he call himself a marketer?

471
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,350
Hey, I heard that.

472
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,080
What about my observational skill?

473
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,350
Where are you going? Hang out with me!

474
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,150
Wait up!

475
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,160
Right, I'm meeting someone on Saturday.

476
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,890
Me too. My mom is visiting.

477
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,360
Who are you meeting?

478
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,400
I don't know.

479
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,870
Who is it?

480
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,840
I'm not curious anyway.

481
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Really?

482
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
Who is it?

483
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,310
Hold on.

484
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,610
Ha-eun.

485
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,680
Yes, Ha-eun.

486
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,110
<i>Uncle.</i>

487
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,280
Are you crying?

488
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,150
Uncle.

489
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,120
Mommy and Daddy are getting a divorce.

490
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,560
Why?

491
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,220
Hey, little princess.

492
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,240
Ha-eun.

493
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,040
Go have a good time with your uncle.

494
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,240
Okay?

495
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,520
Don't worry too much.

496
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,640
I'll talk to her.

497
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,820
Thank you so much for this.

498
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,190
Are you okay?

499
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,130
Yes, I am.

500
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,260
I'm proud of you.

501
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,800
You brat.

502
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,200
I'll call later.

503
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,920
Don't look at me like that.

504
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,260
It's not like this is complete news.

505
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,760
I'd be lying if I said I'm 100% fine,

506
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,630
but I'm handling it as well as I can.

507
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,440
I'm just worried about Ha-eun.

508
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,910
We'll all do our best.

509
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:21,240
So that Ha-eun won't get hurt so much.

510
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,950
Hyun-seung and I are here for you.

511
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,280
Thank you.

512
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,990
And you.

513
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,630
Nobody said you have to be okay.

514
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,380
So if you need a shoulder to lean on,

515
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,800
don't hesitate.

516
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,870
Come to me or Hyun-seung.

517
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,610
We'll always be right by your side.

518
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Okay.

519
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,260
Ah.

520
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,520
It's your favorite mango cake.

521
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,900
You're not eating it?

522
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,440
Don't you want to talk to me?

523
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,050
Uncle.

524
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,110
Yes, Ha-eun.

525
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,420
It's just like Ye-ji's parents.

526
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,050
I know I can't do anything
about the divorce.

527
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,490
But I just hate it.

528
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,360
Your parents made you
really upset, didn't they?

529
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,070
You don't have to understand
why they chose that.

530
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,340
But I hope you remember one thing.

531
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,240
That your parents love you.

532
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,250
And that will never change.

533
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,610
I know that.

534
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,320
Do you know I love you?

535
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,760
I know that, too.

536
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,130
Can you give me a hug?

537
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,630
Please.

538
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,950
Mommy and Daddy are very sorry.

539
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,590
We are sorry for hurting you.

540
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,230
Can I see Daddy every Friday?

541
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,040
You can see him anytime you want.

542
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,840
I love you so much, Sweetie.

543
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,850
Me too.

544
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,850
I love you, Mommy.

545
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,460
Good night, Ha-eun.

546
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,300
Good night, Mommy.

547
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,780
How was Ha-eun?

548
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,920
We'll just have to
pay more attention to her.

549
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,820
It's amazing.

550
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,930
People hurt you the most,

551
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,670
but they also help you heal.

552
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,990
I'm glad.

553
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,270
I'm glad Ha-eun has a good uncle like you.

554
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,450
And...

555
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,150
I'm very thankful that
you are right here with me.

556
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,830
I hope I can become
someone like that to you.

557
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,740
Someone on whom you can lean on.

558
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
You're doing well enough already.

559
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,460
Right,

560
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,210
are you not going to tell me
who you're meeting?

561
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,030
You don't trust me?

562
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,080
I trust you.

563
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,650
But I don't trust the world.

564
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,780
Others can see how handsome you are.

565
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,520
How handsome?

566
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,690
Who are you meeting?

567
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,810
How handsome?

568
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,890
You're being weird.

569
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,320
How handsome?

570
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,730
I'm not moving an inch

571
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,560
until you tell me how handsome I am.

572
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,430
Don't move an inch then.

573
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,300
Here.

574
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,980
I told you to keep it.

575
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,480
It was an excuse.

576
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,250
An excuse to see you again.

577
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,280
That's the look.

578
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,820
You always looked at me that way.

579
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,620
Now I know that it was
because you were nervous.

580
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,160
You were always nervous around me.

581
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,900
Have you ever regretted ending it with me?

582
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,210
Not once.

583
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,280
I was curious.

584
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,920
Did I really get over you?

585
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,220
Could I get over you?

586
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,960
But I realized it when I met you again.

587
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,130
I'm okay.

588
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,660
When I first ran into you,

589
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,030
I felt a little unsettled.

590
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,440
But that was it.

591
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,510
Thank you.

592
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,740
For calling it off.

593
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,450
If you hadn't, I wouldn't be
living my own life.

594
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:40,090
If you still feel bad about the past,
you don't have to.

595
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,920
Be free.

596
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,490
Okay.

597
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,230
Jae-woon is getting married.

598
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,620
If you need an excuse to contact him,

599
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,270
that's your hint.

600
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,510
Thank you.

601
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:04,210
Shall we shake hands?

602
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,350
Take care of yourself.

603
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,790
You take care of yourself.

604
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,530
I'm the last person
you need to worry about.

605
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:18,870
You're right.

606
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,820
Bye.

607
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,820
You look younger.

608
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,490
I should call you my sister.

609
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,290
What?

610
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,030
You haven't been skipping meals, right?

611
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,430
No, I haven't. Don't worry.

612
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,160
I'm sure glad to see you.

613
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,020
But I feel like such a nuisance.

614
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:07,380
I should've removed you
as my checkup guardian.

615
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,640
Also, you didn't have to pick me up.

616
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,180
It was the perfect excuse to see you.

617
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,520
I'm really happy to see you.

618
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,390
Me too.

619
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,620
I've wondered how you were doing,
but I couldn't call.

620
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,230
How stupid of her to let him go like that.

621
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,200
Are you dating anyone?

622
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Yes.

623
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,430
Who? Is she a good person?

624
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,590
Yes, she's a very good person.

625
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,940
I see.

626
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,820
I'm happy for you.

627
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,370
Why did you come together?

628
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,430
Well...

629
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,670
Both of you.

630
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,810
Come and sit here.

631
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:13,870
Why?

632
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,600
You two are dating again?

633
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,580
Yes, we are.

634
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
You can't.

635
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,110
I am against it.

636
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,340
Why? You like Hyun-seung.

637
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,920
Mom.

638
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,630
There's a sea of good women out there!

639
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:14,160
Hyun-seung is too good for you! No!

640
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,000
Just no!

641
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,200
What?

642
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,440
But ma'am.

643
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,910
I won't date someone
without your blessing.

644
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,580
What are you doing?

645
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,180
Beg her and say that you need me.

646
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,050
Hurry.

647
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,830
Whatever. I can't live without him.

648
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,030
I just can't.

649
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,030
I can't live without Song-ah, either.

650
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,900
I just can't.

651
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,340
I can't.

652
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,870
I really can't live without her.

653
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,070
We'll just have to sit here in protest.

654
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,430
Are you cold?

655
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,720
-I can't live without her.
-Those two...

656
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,000
Jae-woon is getting married.

657
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,680
If you need an excuse to contact him,

658
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,270
that's your hint.

659
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,310
Really?

660
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,420
You never thought of me as a friend?

661
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,320
Not even once.

662
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,300
From the very beginning.

663
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,580
It's been a while.

664
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,970
Thank you for coming.

665
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,260
Are you?

666
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,470
I don't know why I came.

667
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,040
Why did you call me?

668
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,470
Well...

669
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,540
I wanted to have a drink with you.

670
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,540
Here.

671
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,950
I heard you're getting married.

672
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,950
Congratulations.

673
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,750
Thank you.

674
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,900
I can't go to the wedding,

675
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,400
but I'll be sure
to give you a big present.

676
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,630
You better.

677
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,340
It looks like you've been doing well.

678
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,440
You have always been exceptional.

679
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,780
I've done my best to interfere,

680
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,910
yet you've succeeded anyway.

681
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,850
That's why I called myself your friend.

682
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,290
Jae-woon,

683
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,930
thank you.

684
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,370
You reached out to me

685
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,770
and treated me like a real friend.

686
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,130
You are not dying tomorrow.

687
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,020
From now on,

688
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,760
don't call me out at night.

689
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,890
I can do afternoons.

690
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,960
My nights are solely
dedicated to Ji-seung.

691
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Alright?

692
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,560
Okay.

693
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,000
You've changed.

694
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,670
Don't smile, or you'll grow on me.

695
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:26,809
PARTY A: KLAR LEE MYUNG-SUK
PARTY B: HARA CHAE JI-SEUNG

696
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,440
Thank you for accepting this project.

697
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,040
I look forward to working with you.

698
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,340
I look forward to working with you, too.

699
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,810
I think it'll be fun.

700
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:50,810
Yes.

701
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,680
Also,

702
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,520
I want to thank you.

703
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,960
What you said that day

704
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,090
helped me see things better.

705
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,360
Thank you so much.

706
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,770
I only said a few things.

707
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:15,340
Your sincerity was what did the job.

708
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,110
It was all thanks to Hyun-seung.

709
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,050
Sometimes it was awkward,

710
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,490
and sometimes it was
a bit much to take in,

711
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:37,120
but he was genuine and open
every single moment.

712
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,530
I'm really glad.

713
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,970
Glad that I didn't
turn a blind eye to his heart.

714
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,700
Right,

715
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,740
my name is Chae Hyun-seung.

716
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,480
Chae Hyun-seung.

717
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,180
Senior Yoon.

718
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,050
Don't put on that lipstick.

719
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,020
Who are you to butt in like this?

720
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,780
I'm nothing.

721
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,880
That's right. You're nothing...

722
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,190
I like you.

723
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,420
I said I like you.

724
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,990
All the more reason not to.

725
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,930
Because I can't give you anything.

726
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,590
But I'll still protect you.

727
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,130
I think you should move.

728
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,670
Get out of my girl's face, you monster.

729
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,370
Let's go.

730
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,380
Here.

731
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,710
Why do you like me?

732
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,950
It's just...

733
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,440
It's just because it's you.

734
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,250
I like you because you're you.

735
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,650
From this moment, I can't hear anything.

736
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,890
<i>I feel lucky and thankful
for each moment.</i>

737
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,000
<i>I'm happy that I'm with you.</i>

738
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,890
There's a typo here.

739
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,620
I'll fix that.

740
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,690
Have you checked who should approve this?

741
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,090
I'll check one more time.

742
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,060
Okay. Good job.

743
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:21,630
Thank you.

744
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,620
Sure.

745
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,240

Every year.

00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:06,930
Together.
