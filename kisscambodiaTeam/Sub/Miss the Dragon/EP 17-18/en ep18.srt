17
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,500
(Luofeng Pavilion)

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Drink the Lethe Tea

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,750
and go across the Luofeng Bridge.

20
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,020
(Luofeng Pavilion)

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
I’ll be by your side.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,430
I gave you fireflies

23
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,600
because the girl I like is named after
the insect.

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,270
But Yuchi,

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,270
aren’t you with the girl you like,

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
Liuying?

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,470
You’re Liuying.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,550
You’re the same person.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,190
The same person?

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,070
A long time ago, your name was Liuying.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,320
And later, you were Ayu.

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,710
You mean

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,760
I’m the girl you like?

34
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,190
Yes.

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,190
My name is Yuchi Longyan.

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,520
A long time ago,

37
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,910
you called me the Dragon King.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,120
The Dragon King?

39
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,910
Miss Ayu,

40
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,160
drink the Lethe Tea

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,400
and you’ll forget the past.

42
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,350
Yuchi, after I drink the Lethe Tea,

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,430
will I forget you

44
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,630
like Liuying did?

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,430
I’ll remember you.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Wherever you are,

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,320
I will find you.

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,040
But I don’t want to forget you.

49
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,070
Miss Ayu,

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,400
it’s about time. Please drink it.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Drink the Lethe Tea,

52
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,400
bury the past in dust

53
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,960
and leave it behind you.

54
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,460
(Luofeng Pavilion)

55
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,470
Drink it.

56
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,240
Don’t miss the time.

57
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,270
Will you please stop staring at me?

58
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,520
I’m nervous.

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,760
I’ve finished it.

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,630
Ayu,

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,590
wait for me.

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Yuchi,

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,400
I won’t forget you.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,520
The imperial palace is huge.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,190
I’m scared.

66
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,590
The palace is secure.

67
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,150
You won’t need my protection any longer.

68
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,120
But I don’t want to go.

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,910
I have no friends in the palace.

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,070
Am I too greedy to just hope

71
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
to see you?

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
Yuchi,

73
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,150
I won’t forget you.

74
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,470
From now on,

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,870
I’m the master of my fate.

76
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,020
(General’s Mansion)

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,520
Brother.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,750
Congratulations, General.
You have a daughter.

79
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,750
Great!

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,070
Zhao, look at my baby.

81
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,190
Wow,

82
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,350
she’s pretty.

83
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,590
Her big eyes

84
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,910
are just like yours in the earlier days.

85
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,400
Congratulations, brother.

86
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,400
You have an heir. Like father, like son.

87
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Mind your words.

88
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,120
This is my daughter.

89
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,400
Yes, my tongue slipped.

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,910
A daughter is also good.

91
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,190
She looks heroic.

92
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,680
Maybe a female general in the future.

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,470
Dad will make sure you grow up

94
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,800
to a gorgeous lady

95
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,280
who enchants everyone.

96
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,070
By then,

97
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,960
-This time Liuying is Feng Chenyue,
-we’ll organize a tournament

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,870
-the general’s daughter.
-to find you an invincible husband.

99
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,520
Congratulations, General.

100
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,400
I thought she’d

101
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,680
be like the ladies in operas,

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,030
a tender, perfumed

103
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
and gentle lady of rank.

104
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
Unexpectedly,

105
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,440
that gentle girl is me,

106
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,470
while she...

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,150
Bravo! Bravo!

108
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,470
Well done!

109
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,150
Be serious with it. The general said

110
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,190
the winner of the tournament

111
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,870
will be promoted the chiliarch.

112
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,190
It seems Gao Yang is better.

113
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,710
General!

114
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,030
Rise, my men.

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Well, she likes swords and spears

116
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,680
more than men do.

117
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,000
Like her late father,

118
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,390
she was given the General’s seal

119
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,350
and now defends the border
from Dongluo’s attacks.

120
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,150
Gao Yang’s kung fu is impressive.

121
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,080
How fortunate it is to have a henchman

122
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,120
like him in our army.

123
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,270
Gao Yang,

124
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
you’re the chiliarch now.

125
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,590
Anyone has dissents?

126
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,150
No! No! No!

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Thank you, General.

128
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,350
The competition isn’t a real war.

129
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,830
We’re brothers bonded by blood.

130
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,640
Yet you lost control in order to win.

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,910
Twenty club-beatings

132
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,270
to make sure you remember.

133
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, General.

134
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,680
But the unyielding spirit

135
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
to fight till the last second

136
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,030
is exemplary.

137
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,880
You’re the chiliarch’s deputy now.

138
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Be a role model for the men.

139
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,240
Thank you, General.

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,510
From this competition,

141
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
I saw all your progress.

142
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,760
We’ll have a feast tonight.

143
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,320
Thank you, General.

144
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,800
(Loving Father Feng Se)

145
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Father,

146
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,800
I will realize your dream

147
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,910
to defeat the Dongluo invaders

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
and bring peace to the border.

149
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,590
Alright.

150
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,440
If that’s your dream,

151
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,590
I’ll stay with you on this path

152
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,830
and help you realize it.

153
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,710
I’ll remember you.

154
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
Wherever you are,

155
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
I will find you.

156
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,710
Yuchi, I won’t forget you.

157
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,880
From now on,

158
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,560
I’m the master of my fate.

159
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,120
My name is Yuchi Longyan.

160
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,590
A long time ago,

161
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,320
you called me the Dragon King,

162
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,320
or Brother Yuchi.

163
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,950
Yuchi.

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,760
Cheers!

165
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,020
Come on, bottoms up!

166
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,800
My men, drink up.

167
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,950
Cheers!

168
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,320
General, General,

169
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,030
may I have a word? Come with me.

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,270
-What is it, Uncle Zhao?
-Over here.

171
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,320
I mean, General,

172
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,910
how could you sit so close

173
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,150
to them?

174
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,510
It’s improper.

175
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,030
We’re brothers bonded by blood.

176
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
What’s the matter with dining with them?

177
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,560
It’s not what I mean.

178
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,200
They’re men while you’re a woman.

179
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,950
All in all,

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,470
you’re Lady Feng.

181
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,200
How could you sit so close to them?

182
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,320
Uncle Zhao, Dongluo troops
are still there.

183
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,590
In Feng Army, we’re all fighting men,

184
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,710
and I’m not Lady Feng.

185
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,030
I don’t care.

186
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,560
I promised to your father.

187
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,350
Forgive me about the nagging,
but I have to say it.

188
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,830
You need to keep some distance.

189
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,440
Look, you gave them a leave

190
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,080
and they're lost in fun.

191
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,680
I’ll hush them off.

192
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,760
Uncle Zhao, I’ll scare them off.

193
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,760
Hey, General, oh...

194
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,320
Look, the girls on the book

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
are in perfect shapes.

196
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,680
They’re so...

197
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,240
How to put it?

198
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,950
Plump and hot.

199
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,800
Yes. Right.

200
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,390
-This is absurd!
-General.

201
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,470
General, General.

202
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,440
What’s up? Go on.

203
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,590
They’re pretty.

204
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,680
Look, General,

205
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,830
it’s a wrongdoing.

206
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,150
In the army, this kind of book
is contraband.

207
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,350
Why?

208
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,800
Your father said

209
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,200
this kind of book weakens the morale.

210
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,910
Right.

211
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,880
This kind of book weakens the morale.

212
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,560
Give it here. It’s confiscated.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,350
-Give it to the General.
-Hurry.

214
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,560
Do you have nothing else to do?

215
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,710
You know the rules.

216
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,830
Practice the boxing you learned today
for 10 times.

217
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,120
Uncle Zhao, it’s break time.

218
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,830
They’ve finished all the practices.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,830
Let them go.

220
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,880
-Yes.
-No, we can’t.

221
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,800
They knew it’s a violation.

222
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,680
So they should be punished.

223
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,880
Yes, it’s a violation.

224
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,270
But...

225
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,440
A fault confessed is half redressed.

226
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,680
Confess.

227
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,510
General Zhao, we’ve learned it.

228
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,080
It’s not right. We’re sorry.

229
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,440
Since the General pleaded for you,

230
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,590
you can go now.

231
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,510
-Thank you, General.
-Thank you, General.

232
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,910
Come on. Let’s go.

233
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,710
General.

234
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,680
(An Evilly Charming Emperor’s Requite)

235
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,030
An Evilly Charming Emperor’s Requite.

236
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,180
(Chapter Four)

237
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,660
(Chapter Five)

238
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,350
General.

239
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,440
Not again.

240
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,120
You swing the sword all day long. Look.

241
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,390
Come on.

242
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,760
Look at the calluses on your hand.

243
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,470
Have some hand cream.

244
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,880
The thing you’re applying

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,880
is greasy for the hand.

246
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,390
When we were in the palace...

247
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,640
I heard that’s what the women

248
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,680
in the palace do.

249
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,950
They’re in the palace.

250
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,200
We’re in the army.

251
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,080
Who said women need skincare?

252
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,350
A woman grooms for her lover.

253
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,440
Dress yourself up

254
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,080
for the man you love.

255
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,240
No, no, no.

256
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,950
I can’t agree with this.

257
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,320
Women dress up to please ourselves.

258
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,910
I’m happy when I’m not dressed up.

259
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,760
So why bother? Take it away.

260
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,560
No.

261
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,590
You won’t be able

262
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,390
to find a good husband like this.
You need it.

263
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,320
My father’s will isn’t completed.

264
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,710
I have no mood for romance.

265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Besides,

266
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,880
if a man likes me
when I’m not dressed up,

267
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
he likes the real me.

268
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,510
The kind of man
who doesn’t only care the appearance

269
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
is the kind I like.

270
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,590
You have a point.

271
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,680
Right?

272
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,120
Come on.

273
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,760
Off you go with these.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,710
Men come to the General’s tent often.

275
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,120
It’s inconvenient. Go.

276
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,080
-Be a good girl. Off you go.
-What about the skincare?

277
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,510
Go, go, go.

278
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,030
(Chapter Eight)

279
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,950
The Dragon King is strong,

280
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,800
muscular and slim.

281
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,640
Not bad.

282
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,350
The mortal girl is a maid.

283
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,240
Good shaped,

284
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,640
but kind of silly when she talks.

285
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,120
General.

286
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,320
General, the new Military Supervisor
is here.

287
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,320
Who is here?

288
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,590
The new Military Supervisor

289
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,390
appointed by the Emperor.

290
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,560
Let’s welcome him.

291
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,390
I watched it so many times

292
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,600
and must have learned it.

293
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,750
Why can’t I do it?

294
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,320
I’m so stupid.

295
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,440
What’s up?

296
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,680
Nothing.

297
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,510
Then why covering your forehead?

298
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,510
Headache?

299
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,080
Your forehead...

300
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,680
Let me see what’s wrong.

301
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,390
Who?

302
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,200
Who is it?

303
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,080
Is it...?

304
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,870
Is it

305
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,870
a ghost or something?

306
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,910
Help!

307
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,990
I’m invisible. I’m invisible.

308
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,270
You’re such a timid elf.

309
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,600
Having been too long in mortal world,
I forgot I’m an elf.

310
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,270
Didn’t I tell you

311
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,960
when you want the peach makeup,

312
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,200
you can just summon me?

313
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,680
Why did you poke your forehead?

314
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,750
I...

315
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,030
How did you know it?

316
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,600
Because

317
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,870
I linked your forehead

318
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,110
with mine

319
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,200
using the Body-Sharing Spell.

320
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,320
When you poked your forehead,

321
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,230
I felt the pain too.

322
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,080
Funny.

323
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,480
Not again.

324
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,630
Why did you cast such a spell on me?

325
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,030
Because you’re the dearest to me,

326
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,910
aren’t you?

327
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,270
I am your suitor.

328
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,720
Impossible.

329
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,750
I’m truly a suitor.

330
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,990
He said he’s my suitor.

331
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,840
Was he serious?

332
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,150
Or perhaps, it was just a joke.

333
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,480
Did I scare her?

334
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,720
I mean

335
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,750
you were my personal maid.

336
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,200
Of course we’re close.

337
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,560
See?

338
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,230
Suitor?

339
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,320
He was kidding.

340
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Hey, you,

341
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,230
aren’t you busy in Luofeng Pavilion?

342
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,390
You come every a few days.

343
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
That’s absurd.

344
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,440
My lord, don’t joke with me.

345
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,200
Help me with the peach makeup

346
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
and then go back to work.

347
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,080
I told you

348
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,680
to stop addressing me my lord.

349
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,910
You can call me by my name,

350
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,480
Xue Qianxun.

351
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,560
You want to keep it going?

352
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,910
Alright.

353
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,680
My dear Lord Xue Qianxun,

354
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,480
help me with the peach makeup, please.

355
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,870
Come on.

356
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,870
Is our love

357
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,680
mutual now?

358
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,080
Uncle Zhao said
the new Military Supervisor

359
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
is a new noble.

360
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
How can I win him over?

361
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,200
Should I go soft or tough on him?

362
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,510
Mr. Lu, have some tea.

363
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,680
What’s with his gaze?

364
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,600
It’s so impolite.

365
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,480
I can finally have a closer look at you.

366
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,800
I guess you think that as a woman.

367
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,110
I’m not equal

368
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,230
to the post of the general.

369
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,440
If I guess wrong,

370
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,110
stop looking at me

371
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,800
with your filthy eyes.

372
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,320
General.

373
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,150
No.

374
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Chenyue,

375
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,720
I must apologize.

376
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,030
I just want to see

377
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,080
how long it’ll take

378
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,630
until you recognize me.

379
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,680
You are...

380
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
I’m your brother, Zheng.

381
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,510
My brother Zheng?

382
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,800
Zheng!

383
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,360
It’s you, Zheng.

384
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Get up.

385
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,870
You’ve changed so much.

386
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,320
I didn’t recognize you.

387
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,360
Good for you, Lu Zheng,

388
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,910
the Military Supervisor.

389
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,630
Call me Zheng.

390
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,990
Alright, Zheng.

391
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,080
You’re still so good-looking.

392
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,750
That hasn’t changed.

393
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,320
Like when we were young,

394
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,390
you still have no manners.

395
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,990
Here. Have some tea.

396
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,870
Alright.

397
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,960
Zheng is still the same.

398
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,110
However,

399
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,150
Yuchi in my dream is more of a man.

400
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,440
(Deceptions in War)

401
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,200
(An Evilly Charming Emperor’s Requite)
What are the chances?

402
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,230
I’m also reading this book.

403
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,980
(An Evilly Charming Emperor’s Requite)

404
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,960
This is...

405
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,320
Chenyue,

406
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,110
as the General,

407
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,320
how could you read a book

408
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,200
that will undermine the morale?

409
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,320
This is... not mine.

410
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,440
I confiscated it from a few

411
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,800
soldiers.

412
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,230
I would never read this kind of books

413
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,840
that will undermine the morale.

414
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,110
That’s good.

415
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,630
I’ll burn it now.

416
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,840
I should do it.

417
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,080
You’re my supervisor.

418
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,510
How could I leave it to you?

419
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,800
Zheng,

420
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,480
you had a rough journey to come here.

421
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,910
Go and have some rest.

422
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,320
There’s a welcoming dinner.

423
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,390
Right.

424
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,390
Thank you, Chenyue.

425
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,840
See you tonight.

426
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,110
Please.

(Chapter Two)

429
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,440
It’s just a book.

430
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,110
How can it possibly
undermine the morale?

431
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
I should find out.

432
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,910
Help!

433
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,990
Stop!

434
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
Darling!

435
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,200
Mother!

436
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Stop crying.

437
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,910
Mother!

438
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,150
It’s Dongluo troops.

439
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,080
Save the villagers.

440
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

(Lu’s Art of War)

442
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,110
Who are you?

443
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,360
My name is Chenyue. What’s up?

444
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,030
How can a girl climb up the tree?

445
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,510
Where are your manners?

446
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,560
It’s a lot of fun.

447
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,360
Look, there are tasty fruits on it.

448
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,560
Here. Catch it.

449
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,230
Young master, are you alright?

450
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,320
Young master.

451
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,800
Really?

452
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,750
If you don’t like the fruit,

453
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,030
I’ll give you this flower.

454
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
You’re like a girl as pretty

455
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,680
as the flower.

456
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,320
Mind your tongue.

457
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,990
I’m a boy and I’m older than you.

458
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,750
You should call me Brother Zheng.

459
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,480
Brother Zheng.

460
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,910
It’s been ten years.

461
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,870
The flower is still here.

462
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,390
You haven’t changed at all,

463
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,910
which is great.

464
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,700
(Lu’s Art of War)

465
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,680
General, according to our scouts
in Dongluo,

466
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,200
their troops have nothing abnormal.

467
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,990
And they let their guard down.

468
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,200
The Dongluo Crown Prince

469
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,080
used to eat deer meat every day.

470
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,360
But recently,

471
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,680
he didn’t ask the kitchen to roast it.

472
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,910
I heard their crown prince loves luxury

473
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,720
and is a hedonistic man.

474
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,680
Yes.

475
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,560
He’s quite not himself lately.

476
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,560
I think something is wrong.

477
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,750
A man who is used to deer meat

478
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,390
gives up his favorite suddenly.

479
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,230
Is he

480
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,030
not in the troops?

481
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,030
But I didn’t hear any reports
from the scouts.

482
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,110
Maybe he covered it up.

483
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,230
Uncle Zhao,

484
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,630
order the camp on full alert.

485
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,800
Send out all our scouts

486
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,360
to search for Dongluo Crown Prince.

487
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,630
Yes.

488
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,360
What’s it in your hands?

489
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,440
What is it?

490
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,870
It’s a labyrinth casket.

491
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,630
(Jade)
A friend gave it to me.

492
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,910
It helps me get my head straight

493
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,600
when I cannot think.

494
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,230
Is it difficult?

495
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,230
It depends on the player.

496
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,360
Have a try.

497
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,200
Yuchi.

498
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,560
