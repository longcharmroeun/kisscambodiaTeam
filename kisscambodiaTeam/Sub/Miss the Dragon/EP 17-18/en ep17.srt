17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,430
Go see her

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,030
before she goes to the palace.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,520
Are you encouraging me to see Ayu?

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
Is it proper?

21
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,030
Let’s say you can bear with it.

22
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,160
But what about her?

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Thank you.

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,760
Never mind.

25
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,320
(Shen’s Mansion)

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,400
My Lady Divine,

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,190
you must learn the imperial courtesy,

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,190
or you’d be in trouble.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,880
Madam Zhao,

30
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,160
teach her women’s manners

31
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,910
and the imperial courtesy quickly.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,160
Yes.

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,600
I’ll teach you formal kneeling.

34
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,990
Practice 30 times at least tonight.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,960
Do as I teach you.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,160
Right hand on top.

37
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,550
Both hands on the right side.

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,800
Withdraw the right foot, and curtsy.

39
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,880
Smile.

40
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,800
Repeat the courtesy I taught you tonight

41
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,830
until your moves are natural.

42
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,710
It’d be impolite to do otherwise
in the palace.

43
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,880
I’ll check on you tomorrow.

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,150
It says the one who survives is blessed.

45
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,310
But the life as a concubine

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
to be locked away in the palace

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,840
is never the one I want.

48
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,120
Perhaps,

49
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,470
I should count my blessings.

50
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,910
Yuchi,

51
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,310
I know I have to forget you.

52
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,310
But now,

53
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,630
let me spare a thought on you.

54
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,910
Yuchi.

55
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,070
Yuchi,

56
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,560
is it true that I won’t

57
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
see you again?

58
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,190
You will not come to see me

59
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,240
when I release the firefly?

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,630
No.

61
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,800
Just try it.

62
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,800
Little firefly,

63
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,440
please tell Yuchi for me

64
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,070
that I have so much to talk to him.

65
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,960
You don’t even care to try, do you?

66
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,470
I’m here.

67
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,400
Yuchi!

68
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
Don’t come close.

69
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,870
Alright, I won’t.

70
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,630
I know everything.

71
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,190
Congratulations.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
But

73
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,240
I don’t want to be
the emperor’s concubine.

74
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,070
Yuchi, can you take me away with you?

75
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Ayu,

76
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,590
approaching you now

77
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
means nothing but harm.

78
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,400
I can’t.

79
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,870
Right.

80
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,560
If the emperor’s
new concubine disappears,

81
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,560
what a huge uproar it will be.

82
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,240
Yuchi, can we please

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,070
watch the fireworks one more time

84
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,520
on the city wall?

85
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,590
Please, I beg you.

86
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
One last time.

87
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,150
Close your eyes then.

why are you so good to me?

106
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,910
Why would you watch fireworks,

107
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,560
shooting stars and Star Halo with me?

108
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,710
And last time,

109
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,030
I was surrounded by butterflies.

110
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,950

Yuchi,

112
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,200
I like you.

113
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,950
Do you also...?

114
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,880
No, I don’t.

115
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,150
You know men and demons
go separate ways.

116
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,390
And you’re a girl.

117
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,150
Mind your tongue.

118
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,080
I’m afraid I’d never be able to say it.

119
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,560
Yuchi,

120
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,080
you gave me a jar of fireflies

121
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,350
so that I can summon you anytime.

122
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,710
But each time I summon you,

123
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,640
it’s out of my deepest affection.

124
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,510
I don’t care that you’re a demon.

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,470
I’m...

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,270
just afraid you don’t feel the same.

127
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,640
You misunderstand.

128
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,560
I gave fireflies

129
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,800
because the girl I like is named after
the insect.

130
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,350
Fireworks and Star Halo

131
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,680
are also her favorites.

132
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,510
But you’re Ayu,

133
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,080
not my girl, Liuying.

134
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,200
Liuying?

135
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,030
Who is she?

136
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,510
She’s the one I love.

137
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,560
I’m good to you

138
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,000
because you resemble her a lot.

139
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,560
That’s it? I look like her?

140
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,030
The fireworks show is over.

141
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,200
Yuchi,

142
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,390
can you give me more fireflies?

143
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,200
The imperial palace is huge.

144
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,880
I’m scared.

145
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,950
You don’t need them.

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,590
You’re the Lady Divine.

147
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,590
The Emperor will give you everything.

148
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,120
The palace is secure.

149
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
You won’t need my protection any longer.

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
But I don’t want to go.

151
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,440
I have no friends in the palace.

152
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,000
Don’t worry.

153
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,710
Qingqing will go with you.

154
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,910
Well, can you

155
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,680
come by occasionally?

156
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,590
I cannot.

157
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,200
You don’t have to come often.

158
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,150

on my birthdays.

160
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,470
Still not convenient?

If I’m...

162
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,030

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,150
is indeed charming.

191
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,510
It’s sad mine isn’t as good as his.

192
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,390
Let me teach you.

193
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,680
Xue Qianxun…

194
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,200
I mean,

195
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,710
my lord.

196
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,150
Alright, I paint it on purpose.

197
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,390
However,

198
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,640
the one you painted is fiercer.

199
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
But the meteor mark on your forehead

200
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,830
is unique.

201
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,950
It’s ugly.

202
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,120
Are you mocking me?

203
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,640
No, I’m not.

204
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,200
In my eyes,

205
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,640
you’re always good.

206
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,760
The meteor mark is also good.

207
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,680
Are you well lately?

208
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,560
Yes.

209
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,000
Right.

210
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,590
How could you come here?

211
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,830
The Dragon King said

212
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,710
non-mortals have to defeat

213
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,000
the heavenly guards

214
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,510
to get in the palace.

215
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,320
I’m immortal lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

216
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,830
Right.

217
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,910
You’re not a demon.

218
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,030
Well, did you come to see me?

219
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,910
Everything alright?

220
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,080
I want to know

221
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,880
if you’re happy living in the palace.

222
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
Fine clothes and food,

223
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,390
as many as I want.

224
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,230
You know, there are various of foods

225
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,480
for the imperials,

226
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,910
like rose cake,

227
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,960
osmanthus and chestnut biscuit,
octagon jujube cake.

228
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,390
So delicious that I bit my tongue,
but...

229
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,080
But

230
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,200
we’re like caged canaries.

231
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,080
Not until now

232
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,440
did I realize how beautiful my life was.

233
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,870
I could go anywhere as my wish.

234
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,270
I...

235
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,150
also want to know

236
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
your opinion on your lord,

237
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,110
I mean, on me,

238
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
Xue Qianxun.

239
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,870
It’s fine.

240
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,200
Say your mind.

241
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,080
My...

242
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,750
However, you must be honest.

243
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,110
Are you sure you want to hear?

244
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,150
Please.

245
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,680
I’ll say it then.

246
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,990
Your face is as cold as ice.

247
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,870
You’re rigid

248
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,630
with rules and intolerant.

249
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,440
And you’re easily

250
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,030
offended.

251
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,270
You asked me to say it.

252
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,150
You never spare anyone
the shame of punishment.

253
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,150
And you’re not easy-going.

254
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,560
Take the sachet for an example...

255
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,110
Where are you?

256
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,680
I just started.

257
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,630
It’s not finished yet.

258
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,910
Do you know what the sachet is for?

259
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,800
To keep demons and elves away.

260
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,960
And you gave it to me, a bird elf?

261
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,230
But for the sake

262
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,440
of its exquisite embroidery

263
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,080
and your good will,

264
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,390
I’ll take it with delight.

265
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,720
And there’s your ice-cold face.

266
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,720
Cold and serious though,

267
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,270
it’s good-looking.

268
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,150
I can never get tired of it.

269
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,870
You’re rigid with rules.

270
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,360
But you can’t do anything about it.

271
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,560
You’re the lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

272
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,360
To run the place, you must be strict.

273
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,270
As for the punishments,

274
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,960
you punish me

275
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,390
for many of my behaviors.

276
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,440
But they’re not harsh at all.

277
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,630
So, you’re actually very nice to me,

278
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,080
giving me gifts,
buying me osmanthus cakes

279
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,440
and putting on peach makeup for me.

280
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,480
Others

281
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,440
may mistake that you’re my suitor.

282
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,800
I am your suitor.

283
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,030
Impossible.

284
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,230
I’m truly a suitor.

285
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,680
When...

286
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,480
When did you come back?

287
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,990
I never left.

288
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,840
I thought you hate me.

289
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
You often scold me

290
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,800
and

291
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,360
mock at the meteor mark on my forehead.

292
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,870

Yuchi, is it you?

349
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,990
Little butterfly,

350
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,390
is Yuchi

351
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,480
occupied?

352
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,680
Did he send you over?

353
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Tell him for me

354
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,630
that I’ll wait for him
on every birthday.

355
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,080
Am I too greedy to just hope

356
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,080
to see you?

357
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,960
Ayu,

358
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
don’t wait for me any longer.

359
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
However,

360
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,960
the emperor’s love didn’t last long.

361
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,360
Over decades in the palace,

362
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,600
Ayu saw the emperor favoring new girls

363
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,960
and leaving her in her chamber alone.

364
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,080
She waits quietly

365
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,230
for the butterfly
to appear in the garden

366
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,560
and the long-lasting love in her heart.

367
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,200
Forgive me

368
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,200
for all your sufferings in these years.

369
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
It’s my fault.

370
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,680
I thought

371
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,080
if you married the emperor,

372
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
you’d be free from poverty and bullies.

373
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,680
But I didn’t know

374
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,080
the mortal emperor

375
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,230
would be so inhumane.

376
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,150
Yuchi is still occupied, isn’t he?

377
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,110
Never mind.

378
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,230
He didn’t come

379
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,480
in two years.

380
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,110
But one day,

381
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,960
he will come.

382
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,990
If I could,

383
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,360
I really wish to take you away.

384
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,270
However,

385
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,320
I can do nothing but wait,

386
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,510
in pain,

387
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,030
loneliness,

388
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,560
and with patience.

389
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,800
You broke into the palace
to see her again?

390
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,270
I sent her to the palace,

391
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,800
hoping she could live a better life,

392
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,910
free from unfair treatment.

393
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,680
But now,

394
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,110
I regret it.

395
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,150
Well,

396
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,440
you worry too much.

397
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,630
Stealing Fire Protection Shield,

398
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,150
making rain without authorization,

399
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,910
and defying the heavenly guards
to see her?

400
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,200
If God finds out

401
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
and holds you accountable,

402
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,200
there will be more punishments.

403
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,720
I don’t care about that.

404
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,390
You know what?

405
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,360
Waiting is driving me crazy.

406
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,150
It’s a much crueler punishment for me.

407
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,630
I just hope

408
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,270
time goes by faster.

409
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Be a little more patient.

410
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Trust me.

411
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,630
Your dream will come true soon.

412
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,600
Consort Dowager Yu, look,

413
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,320
fireworks! How beautiful!

414
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,150
I remember

415
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,750
the most beautiful fireworks I’ve seen.

416
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,150
Back then

417
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,960
I was a lowly fisherman’s daughter.

418
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,270
I like you!

419
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,510
For just a moment though,

420
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,990
it’s been the sweetest for 60 years.

421
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,510
You’ve always

422
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,080
been in my heart.

423
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,080
If we meet again,

424
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,390
I’ll not let you go.
