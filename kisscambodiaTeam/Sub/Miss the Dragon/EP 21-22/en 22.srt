Can I please not wear this dress?

19
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,320
It’s hard for me to walk in it.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,470
No.

21
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,430
You look so beautiful in it.

22
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,960
Come on. Let’s practice the etiquette.

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,430
No, I won’t.

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,760
My general.

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,520
Come on. Hurry.

26
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,760
Like this.

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,070

Head up. Chest out.

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,990

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,600

General.

Smile.

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,960

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600

00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,550
Come on.

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,960

Anyone? Catch the assassins.

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
-Where are the assassins?
-Where are they?

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,750
Fall back.

69
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,200
Catch them.

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,870
Don’t let them get away.

71
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,280
Hurry.

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,590
Hurry.

73
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,440
Their moves suggest that
they’re assassins from the underworld.

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,400
But...

75
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,240
But when they attacked me,

76
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,870
they didn’t aim for my throat or heart.

77
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,440
Instead, they aimed for my face.

78
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,590
What’s their goal?

79
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,750
Maybe... They want to disfigure you.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,560
What?

81
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
The dress is ruined.

82
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,870
It’s made by Wind City’s
best embroidery store.

83
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,800
What should we do?

84
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,720
We’ll go to the Empress’s tea feast
this afternoon.

85
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,590
It’s fine.

86
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
Just find a waistband to cover it.

87
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,440
Waist...?

88
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,630
General, my wrist was twisted just now.

89
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
I think I need some treatment.

90
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,070
Long Yan, please.

91
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,560
Come. Help me get dressed.

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,560
General.

93
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
Is this one okay with you?

94
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,350
You can decide it.

95
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,720
Why is my chief guard

96
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,720
blushing?

97
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,750
General.

98
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,840
I think this is the one.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Maybe... They want to disfigure you.

100
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Disfigure me?

101
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,800
Who would want to disfigure a general?

102
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
But those blades

103
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,950
were really aiming for my face.

104
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,080
They want to stab my eyes.

105
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,460
(Xu’s Mansion)

106
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,560
Empress, I heard that His Majesty

107
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,470
intends to make Feng Chenyue
his consort.

108
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,150
Nonsense.

109
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,510
General Feng is the general
who guards the frontier.

110
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,910
How can His Majesty
make her a consort?

111
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,320
Your Grace.

112
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,590
I heard the same rumors.

113
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,680
Seems that His Majesty wants to
reinforce the loyalty of the army.

114
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Here comes Great Lady General.

115
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,880
Greetings from Chenyue of Feng Family.

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,320
Seems that the Empress is
not so kind to me.

117
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Rise.

118
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,200
Thank you, Your Grace.

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,240
Here comes the Emperor.

120
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,830
Greetings, His Majesty.

121
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,950
Rise.

122
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,710
Thank you, His Majesty.

123
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
I have just finished dealing
with imperial court’s affairs.

124
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,350
I heard that Empress and Consort Rui

125
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,350
are attending a tea feast at
Prime Minister’s Mansion.

126
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,120
So I came to have a look.

127
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,320
Don’t feel restricted.

128
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,880
This...?

129
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,680
This is Chenyue.

130
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
Your Majesty.

131
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,830
When you’re in a lady’s dress,

132
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,150
I can’t even recognize you.

133
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,830
You’re so pretty in this dress.

134
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,320
Come.

135
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,120
Sit next to me.

136
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,470
His Majesty really wants to
make Feng Chenyue his consort?

137
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,470
Feng Chenyue in a lady’s dress...?

138
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,760
It’s unexpected that
she’s not less beautiful

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,470
than any of my consorts.

140
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,830
He wants to make me his consort?

141
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

142
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,000
This wine seems to be good.

143
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,680
Good wine.

144
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,320
Good wine.

145
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,950
Your Majesty,
do you want to have a taste?

146
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,800
General Feng, how can you just
give yours to His Majesty?

147
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,150
Your Majesty, General Feng lived with

148
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,590
the unrefined rustic women
at the frontier.

149
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,510
She doesn’t know the manners.

150
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,240
Your Majesty, my action is
punishable by death.

151
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,760
Please punish me.

152
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
You lived at the frontier.

153
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
It’s normal that

154
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,150
you don’t know Wind City’s courtesies.

155
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
You’re pardoned.

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

157
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,390
You’re indeed a good warrior.

158
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,240
But you need to learn more about

159
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,880
Wind City’s etiquette.

160
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,390
I...

161
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,880
I misbehaved again?

162
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,510
Okay.

163
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,950
I need to check on the east market.

164
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,030
I’ll accompany you no more.

165
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,830
-Safe trip, Your Majesty.
-Safe trip, Your Majesty.

166
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,590
Please.

167
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,830
Bye, Your Majesty.

168
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,800
Do you know that
you just committed a crime?

169
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,200
You were so rude to His Majesty.

170
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,800
You’re still alive

171
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,470
because of your Feng Family’s grace.

172
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
Your Grace, you’re right.

173
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,910
My father always said I’m a wild girl.

174
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,270
He was afraid that my manners

175
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,030
will get me killed.

176
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,320
That’s why he kept me at the frontier.

177
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,510
Now, I’m in Wind City,

178
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,080
I need to learn from

179
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
all of you.

180
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,710
You have a correct understanding
of yourself.

181
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,830
Feng Chenyue is different from
the person described in the rumors.

182
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,240
This must be Consort Rui.

183
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,760
You must be Consort Rui?

184
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,000
Dongluo’s ladies are like

185
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,270
Dongluo’s mountains and rivers.

186
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,350
So pure and fresh.

187
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,470
Really?

188
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,350
Like Dongluo’s landscape?

189
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,270
You’re complimenting my beauty, right?

190
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,950
Consort Rui is still like a child.

191
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,150
His Majesty likes her character.

192
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,030
Consort Rui shows
her emotions so easily.

193
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,080
She’s not a sophisticated person.

194
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,640
So who on earth

195
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
sent those assassins to harm me?

196
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,420
(General’s Mansion)

197
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,710
I heard from the assassins that

198
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,800
Guo Mansion’s chief manager paid them.

199
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,200
Is Guo Family an enemy to Feng Family?

200
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,080
Lor...

201
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,150
Xue Qianxun.

202
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,080
What are you here for?

203
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,440
Little rabbits.

204
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,470
So adorable.

205
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,320
Rabbit-shaped desserts
handmade by Goddess of Moon.

206
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,350
I brought some for you to try.

207
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,680
Then, I’ll make myself at home.

208
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
It’s so delicious.

209
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,120
Have some too.

210
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,270
Otherwise, I’ll eat them all.

211
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,470
It’s all yours.

212
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,800
You’re so nice.

213
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,560
Wait.

214
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,240
Why did Goddess of Moon

215
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,030
give you her hand-made desserts?

216
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,390
She likes you?

217
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,600
I don’t know.

218
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,960
I don’t care about

219
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,510
what she thinks.

220
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,270
I’m not an easy bird.

221
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,910
I’m not an easy bird.

222
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,230
No.

223
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Who is she?

224
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,870
Who is the person

225
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,440
that’s in my head?

226
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,510
I have something to attend to.
I’ll go now.

227
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,150
This meteor mark

228
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,200
is really so hideous?

229
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,150
He said he’d pursue me.

230
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,960
Now he regrets it once he sees the mark.

231
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,750
He claimed that he likes me.

232
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,510
Liar.

233
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,560
Liar. Liar. Liar.

234
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,230
Well.

235
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,960
You touched my whole body.

236
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,390
I’m not an easy bird.

237
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,800
Who is she?

238
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,150
What does she have to do with Qingqing?

239
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,900
General Feng.

240
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
(Xu’s Mansion)

241
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,230
You promised to hang out with me.

242
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,510
You mustn’t break the promise.

243
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,910
Sure.

244
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,110
Let’s not go back for now.

245
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Let’s go somewhere else first.

246
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,270
Where?

247
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,510
Prime Minister’s wife said that

248
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
there are fireworks tonight.

249
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,960
We can watch fireworks everywhere.

250
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,080
Why would we come to
the city wall purposefully?

251
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,800
I once saw

252
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,800
the most beautiful fireworks here.

253
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,200
Yuchi.

254
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,750
I like you.

255
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,680
How about you?

256
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,990
Did you also see

257
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,110
the most beautiful fireworks
at this place?

258
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,800
I’ve never been here before.

259
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
I don’t like watching fireworks, either.

260
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,960
No.

261
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,270
He’s not my Dragon King.

262
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,560
I’m wrong again?

263
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,560
Feng Chenyue, wake up.

264
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,960
But I only watched fireworks
when I was a kid.

265
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,510
I don’t like it now since I’m grown up.

266
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,720
Feng Chenyue.

267
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
You’re so stupid.

268
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,630
You got the wrong person again?

269
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,680
Stop being silly.

270
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,630
For all these days,

271
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,680
I was flirting with

272
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,110
my chief guard.

273
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,840
Gosh. This is so embarrassing.

274
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,560
You’re finally home.

275
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,360
I’ll prepare bath water for you.

276
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,800
Move out of the main yard.

277
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,030
Don’t come in without my permission.

278
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,360
Yes.

279
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,720
What’s going on?

280
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,270
What happened?

281
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,390
Why is Chenyue being mean to you?

282
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,390
Quiet.

283
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,800
What’s going on?

284
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,630
Who’s the bad guy
that wrote this script?

285
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,720
My Dragon King.

286
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,480
Who are you?

287
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:55,020
(General’s Mansion)

288
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Move out of the main yard.

289
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,270
Don’t come in without my permission.

290
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,480
Yes.

291
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,840
I knew that you’d forget me.

292
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,600
Why am I still so sad?

293
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,700
(General’s Mansion)

294
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,100
(General’s Mansion)

295
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,580
(General’s Mansion)

296
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,200
General.

297
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,630
General. General.

298
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,840
General.

299
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,150
You came back late last night.

300
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,750
There’s something
I didn’t have time to tell you.

301
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,800
What is it?

302
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,080
Yesterday, I went to the market.

303
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,360
And I met the underworld assassins

304
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,990
who came to the mansion
to kill you that day.

305
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,080
They hadn’t left Wind City.

306
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,480
You happened to find them?

307
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
So I said I’m born lucky.

308
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,110
Anyway, I heard from the assassins that

309
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,910
the person who paid them

310
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,870
was the chief manager of Guo’s Mansion.

311
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,270
Mr. Guo, from Ministry of Justice?

312
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,680
That’s him.

313
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,230
What’s his history with Feng Family?

314
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,110
Whether there’s history or not,

315
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,600
ask Wind City’s prefectural magistrate

316
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,440
to capture the chief manager of
Guo’s Mansion and interrogate him.

317
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,440
Ministry of Justice is in charge
of all criminal cases.

318
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,870
Capture Mr. Guo’s chief manager

319
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,230
just because of a few words
from underworld assassins.

320
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,720
Do you think that’s possible?

321
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,600
Then what should we do?

322
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,480
Stay still before the enemies
make a move.

323
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,200
Authentic Dongluo desserts.

324
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
Buy one, get one free.

325
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,800
Come take a look.

326
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,680
Guest, there you’re.

327
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,600
Where’s the dessert I ordered?

328
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,200
I’ve packed it for you.

329
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,390
Goodbye.

330
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,910
Master.

331
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,200
Chestnuts. Roasted chestnuts with sugar.

332
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,230
Move.

333
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,200
Lady.

334
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,630
Master.

335
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,680
You’re smart.

336
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,440
Lady, seems that

337
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,800
you’re from Dongluo.

338
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Lady, slow down.

339
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,480
Have some fun with me.

340
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,270
You’re so pretty.

341
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,990
It hurts. Ouch.

342
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,440
Master. Master.

343
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,960
How dare you run away
after beating our master?

344
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,110
Run away?

345
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Why are you still standing there?
Beat her.

346
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,800
Don’t come closer.

347
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,750
I’m the son of Marquis Guangping.

348
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
I won’t spare you if you harm me.

349
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,270
Don’t come close.

350
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Don’t come close.

351
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,080
She is...

352
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,390
Jin.

353
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,560
Chenyue.

354
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,680
Why are you in Wind City?

355
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,990
It’s a long story.

356
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,560
Why did you stop me
from beating that pervert?

357
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,680
He’s the son of Marquis Guangping.

358
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,840
It’s hard to get over this episode
if you harm him.

359
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,750
If you want revenge,

360
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,390
there are many chances.

361
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,080
Come. Let’s find a place to chat.

362
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,540
(Puer tea)

363
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,360
Just now,

364
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,720
you dodged it fast.

365
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,720
So I said your skills
aren’t sharp enough.

366
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,200
After all these years,

367
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,870
your aim is still so bad.

368
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,510
Seems that

369
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,800
you’re not doing so well
in the underworld.

370
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,110
My aim is bad?

371
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,080
You might be the only person

372
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,510
who dares to say that
in the four nations.

374
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,870
