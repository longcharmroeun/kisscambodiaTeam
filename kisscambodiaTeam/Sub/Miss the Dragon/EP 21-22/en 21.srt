=Episode 21=

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,110
I’m going back to Wind City.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,070
How about you be my Chief Guard?

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,030
Thank you, General.

20
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,630
But, I think you don’t need

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,350
a soldier like me in Wind City.

22
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,160
You don’t have to answer me now.

23
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,990
We’ll set off tomorrow

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,030
and you can decide it then.

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,070
Chenyue.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,030
I knew you were here.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,200
Zheng.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,480
Mr. Lu.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,310
I have something to tell General.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,070
Excuse me.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
I didn’t finish my word just now.

32
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,270
Actually,

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,760
I got a secret letter from my father,

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,400
saying that some ministers

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,830
are discontented with your achievement.

36
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,190
He asked me to…

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,550
Keep your nose clean

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,830
and stay away from me?

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,600
Of course I’m not afraid of the gossip.

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,040
But, Chenyue,

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,240
you have to be careful in Wind City.

42
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,630
As the Military Supervisor,

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,120
I’m afraid I can’t go back with you.

44
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,070
Returning to Wind City is more
dangerous than a war?

45
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,880
Without people around to help,

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,190
you have to be more cautious.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,040
I got it.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Thank you, Zheng.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,600
General.

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,910
Tomorrow, you’ll return to Wind City.

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,160
You must be well-prepared.

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,990
Long Yan.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,710
General.

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,760
I’ll return to Wind City with you.

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,160
His eyes.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,710
So familiar.

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,910
Yuchi.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
Dragon King.

59
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,320
Yuchi.

60
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,960
Yuchi.

61
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,990
Yuchi.

62
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
Yuchi.

63
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,030
Long Yan.

64
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,630
Take a look.

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,400
Is this the Five Horses Painting
that you want?

66
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,190
Yes, it is.

67
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,150
You can get this painting
from the Emperor.

68
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,000
No wonder you’re the seventh princess
of Dongluo.

69
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,560
It’s nothing.

70
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,190
But I do have an important thing that

71
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,590
I wish you to help me out with.

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,280
I really can’t assemble
this Magic Cube Lock.

73
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,240
Jin, please teach me.

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,590
Okay.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,060
Look. It should be assembled like this.

76
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
(Yue)

77
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,800
This should go in here.

78
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,680
And put it here. That’s it.

79
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,590
It took me over an hour.
But I still couldn’t put it together.

80
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,960
How could you assemble it so fast?

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,350
This is the Luban Lock my dad taught me.

82
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,870
Of course, I can assemble it.

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I even gave it a new name.

84
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,120
Magic Cube Lock.

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,470
It’s a better name than Luban Lock.

86
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,960
Here. This is your birthday present.

87
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,120
It’s for you.

88
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,070
Your name “Jin” was carved in it.

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,470
(Jin)
Thank you, Jin.

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,470
I’ll forever cherish this.

91
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,310
I’m afraid you’re too stupid to use it.

92
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,750
No, I’m not.

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,680
Look. It’s done.

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,630
You assembled it in less than a quarter.

95
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,150
Jin, you’re so smart.

96
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,190
Can I borrow this for a few more days?

97
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,590
Okay.

98
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,150
I wonder

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,910
where’s Chenyue?

100
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,680
Guest, here’s your tea.

101
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,630
General.

102
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,630
This is the third pot of tea.

103
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,190
(Tea)
Four desserts, two sunflower seeds.

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,190
We’ve had enough food and drinks.

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,070
We have traveled for nine days.

106
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,030
Let’s hurry now.

107
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,520
And we can reach Wind City by dawn.

108
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
Then we can freshen ourselves up

109
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
and greet His Majesty tomorrow morning.

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,470
No.

111
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,440
(Tea)
Why not return to Wind City for rest?

112
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,840
Long Yan.

113
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,440
Talk some sense into General.

114
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,400
Long Yan, how do you think of it?

115
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,630
General believes that

116
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,840
if His Majesty knows that

117
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,440
we can get back to Wind City
in nine days.

118
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,870
Then the next time,

119
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,030
he will order us
to return in eight days.

120
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,150
So, I’m on General’s side.

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,720
We just need to return in ten days.

122
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,960
You think so much...

123
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,310
You think so much about everything.

124
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,960
I’m totally defeated.

125
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,870
But, General, at least,

126
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,520
we need to find a place
to clean ourselves

127
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,630
before we greet His Majesty
in the palace.

128
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,350
Greetings, Your Majesty.

129
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,710
Long live, Your Majesty.

130
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,710
Dongluo is now trembling with fear.
There’s no need to worry about it.

131
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,120
My beloved General, please rise.

132
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,680
-Though Feng Chenyue is young,
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

133
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,730
It has been a tiring trip.

134
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,200
she knows how to act soft and
show weakness before His Majesty.

135
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,800
-She’s indeed smarter than her father.
-I’ll reward you thousand taels of gold.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
And I’ll confer you the title
of Great Lady General.

137
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

138
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,240
General Feng.

139
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,950
What’s going on?

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,800
General Feng, please stay.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,390
Empress summoned you
to Fengxi Palace.

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Okay.

143
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,560
Come with me.

144
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,710
Eunuch Qi.

145
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,680
This is General Feng?

146
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,910
Yes, Empress asked me to

147
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,350
bring General Feng to greet her.

148
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,000
It’s a misunderstanding.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,880
Empress hasn’t had good sleep recently.

150
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,350
General Feng has fierce spirits
because she has killed many enemies.

151
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,080
So she wants General Feng
to guard at the door

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,270
since it’s the noon nap time right now.

153
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,510
So it is.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,880
But is it appropriate to
ask General Feng to be the guard?

155
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,560
It’s fine.

156
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,390
Then,

157
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,320
thank you, General Feng.

158
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
Dragon King, there you’re again.

159
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
This is the palace.

160
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,510
I just want to take a look.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,470
If you insist on stopping me,

162
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,440
then fight me.

163
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,270
Dragon King, no one wants to fight you.

164
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,640
Finally, you’ve been behaving
for a decade.

165
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,590
Why are you here again?

166
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,800
Just tell us. Which imperial concubine
do you wish to meet?

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
And what is your gift for her?

168
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,880
We can give it to her for you.

169
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,950
I want to meet General Feng Chenyue.

170
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,270
Fine. I’ll take a look for you.

171
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,150
Why do you help me?

172
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,830
Recently, Lord of Luofeng Pavilion
let out the word that

173
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,240
any Heavenly General who’s able to

174
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,830
stop Dragon King
from entering the palace

175
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,350
does not have to drink the Lethe Tea

176
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,640
if he needs to go through trials
in the earthly realm.

177
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,800
Lord of Luofeng Pavilion
has always been so harsh.

178
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,950
He doesn’t give anyone free passes.

179
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,080
Dragon King, we have to
thank you after all.

180
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,000
Xue Qianxun really loves to poke his nose
in other people’s business.

181
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,000
She’s fine.

182
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,910
Empress asked Feng Chenyue to
guard outside Fengxi Palace.

183
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,880
General Feng.

184
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,320
Empress just started to get sleepy.

185
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
Please, General.

186
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,270
It’s fine.

187
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,470
Empress is so poor.

188
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,760
She’s so young but already
suffers from insomnia.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,470
Imperial Kitchen’s eight treasure
ginseng chick soup

190
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,510
is so nice.

191
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,030
After drinking it,
I feel that my hands, feet,

192
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,510
and even my heart are warmed up.

193
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,640
That’s indeed.

194
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,640
His Majesty said
the weather is cold recently.

195
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,560
He asked Consort Rui to
take care of your health.

196
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,390
This rain is so sudden and strong.

197
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
This is the heaven’s will.

198
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,880
Empress asked Feng Chenyue

199
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,560
to guard outside Fengxi Palace
amid this rain.

200
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,120
Great!

201
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,590
What Great Lady General?

202
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,080
Just let her get soaked in the rain.

203
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,590
May I be excused?

204
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,080
Jin,

205
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,830
we’ve humiliated her.

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,560
Why are you still unhappy?

207
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,680
She fought in the battle
and harmed His Highness.

208
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,200
We can kill her or humiliate her.

209
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,510
But those who’re on her side

210
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,950
should not treat her like that.

211
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,120
But His Highness

212
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,680
has warned me that she’s the enemy.

213
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,910
When I bully her,

214
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,470
I should show her no mercy.

215
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,830
When you grow up,

216
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,590
you’ll understand that

217
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,910
some enemies are worthy of our respect.

218
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,320
Why is the place I’m standing at
not raining?

219
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,880
But everywhere else is?

220
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,880
Yuchi.

221
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,760
Yuchi, is that you?

222
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,270
Immortal of Fate,

223
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,390
this is not how you drink the tea.

224
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,510
Then how should I drink it?

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,640
You should let the heat

226
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,200
disperse on your face.

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,440
It can keep your skin soft and dewy.

228
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,710
Immortal of Rain.

229
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,150
Hurry.

230
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,350
Why is Dragon King flying
in the raining area?

231
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,440
Dragon King is flying
in his dragon form?

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
What does he want?

233
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,000
I’m just asking.

234
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,910
I’m not sure.

235
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,800
I brought my disciples

236
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,150
and observed him for a while.

237
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,510
He just sat in the air

238
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,080
in his huge dragon form.

239
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,720
He’s so impulsive.

240
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,360
I’ve told him that

241
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,840
using his power to
change into his true form

242
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,270
will harm his body.

243
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,270
I guess

244
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,270
he must have evil intentions.

245
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,600
He tries to stop my rain.

246
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,840
Immortal of Rain, don’t worry.

247
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,150
If Dragon King wants to
disrupt your rain,

248
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,150
he might have directly
knocked on your door.

249
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,910
He wouldn’t do
what he’s doing right now.

250
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,360
But he won’t just

251
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,800
fly up in the air

252
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,510
for no reason.

253
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,270
He must have a purpose.

254
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,110
If I’m not mistaken,

255
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,110
he’s sheltering someone from the rain.

256
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,200
Sheltering someone from the rain?

257
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,390
Fine. I’ll make the downpour stronger.

258
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,110
He’s not afraid of water anyway.

259
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,030
It’s useless to make it rain heavier.

260
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,390
Then,

261
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,030
I’ll add thunder to the rain.

262
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,390
Yours is the earth’s thunder,
not the heaven’s thunder.

263
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,870
You’re just scratching his back for him.

264
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,080
Considering your health,

265
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,600
you can’t even take the earth’s thunder.

266
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,870
I remember that you once told me

267
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,840
you want to see Star Halo the most.

268
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,960
Was that you?

269
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,600
Don’t wait for me in the rain next time.

270
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,150
Our General’s Mansion
has plenty of umbrellas.

271
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,800
If you use your power at will

272
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,080
in 49 days,

273
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,720
your power will bite back and harm you.

274
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,080
Dragon King.

275
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,030
Why is your power so weak?

276
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,320
You abused your power

277
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,320
and was hurt again?

278
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,360
Be quiet.

279
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,840
Dragon King.

280
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,720
Don’t abuse your power again.

281
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,440
I’ll watch over Chenyue.

282
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,390
Look at yourself.

283
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,200
This...

284
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,030
This is the authentic piece of
Han Xiaozi’s Five Horses.

285
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,910
Thousands of taels
can’t buy this painting.

286
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,750
You kept your promise and deployed
the female general back to Wind City,

287
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
the Empress will reward you.

288
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
I need to ask Mr. Guo for a favor.

289
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,560
Back then, your beloved son

290
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,990
wanted to accumulate experience
at Feng Army.

291
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,800
So he could return to Wind City
and get promoted.

292
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,150
-But Feng Se discovered his embezzlement.
-Once in Feng Army, forever a part of it.

293
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,990
-and expelled him from Feng Army.
-Once expelled from Feng Army,

294
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,680
there’s no return.

295
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,630
That’s Feng Army’s rules.

296
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,230
Once he’s expelled from Feng Army,

297
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,360
there’s no turning back.

298
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,320
General Feng.

299
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,110
-You even begged the Emperor for mercy.
-General Feng.

300
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,720
Please have some mercy.

301
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,010
-But Feng Se...
-Please have some mercy.

302
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,320
The military order is final.
No one can change it.

303
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,390
Expel him.

304
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,720
-Yes.
-General Feng.

305
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,750
-Dad.
-Jun.

306
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,840
-Your son was so defeated.
-Dad.

307
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,510
He indulged himself in
drinking and riding.

308
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,360
He fell down from the horse
and broke a leg.

309
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,390
Now, you managed to
get Feng Se’s daughter,

310
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,080
Feng Chenyue, back to Wind City.

311
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,390
Don’t you want to teach her a lesson

312
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,510
and revenge your son?

313
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,320
But Feng Chenyue

314
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,600
has made no mistakes.

315
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,840
I can do nothing to her

316
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,480
even though I’m in charge of
the Ministry of Justice.

317
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,030
We’ll

318
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,870
take her eyes.

319
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,200
Here.

320
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,110
Thanks.

321
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,460
(General’s Mansion)

322
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,200
This place offers
good foods and drinks.

323
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
But it’s so boring.

324
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,230
At the frontier,

325
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,480
I drink to the mountain views.

326
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,870
I ride and shoot. It brings so much joy.

327
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,960
Here. This is tasty.

328
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,630
Roasted chestnuts with sugar.

329
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,030
It’s still warm.

330
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,960
Come on.

331
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,080
I can’t be mistaken this time.

332
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,440
Last time when I asked Zheng,

333
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,720
I scared him a lot.

334
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,990
If I’m wrong this time,

335
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,990
I might be seen as a maniac.

336
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,320
Why are you

337
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,150
feeding me chestnuts?

338
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,750
Chestnuts are hot
because they were just bought.

339
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,560
So I peeled it for you.

340
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,750
Really?

341
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,720
It’s not that hot.

342
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,150
Let’s peel chestnuts together.

343
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,230
It’s delicious.

344
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,800
Sit down.

345
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,230
Sit down.

346
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,720
Why did you buy chestnuts for me?

347
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,870
I heard that you’re drinking
on an empty stomach.

348
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,750
I’m afraid it might harm your health.

349
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,680
So I bought you your favorite food.

350
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
How do you know

351
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,360
this is my favorite?

352
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,150
This is

353
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,870
my responsibility.

354
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,080
It’s my job to care for general.

My chief guard

356
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,600
even cares about what I eat?

357
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,230
