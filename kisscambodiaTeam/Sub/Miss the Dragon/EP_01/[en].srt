In my heart,

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,520
I met him

19
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,160
and fell in love with him.

20
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,070
He once gave me

21
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,320
the purest and most unselfish love.

22
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,800
(Liuying)

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,400

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,910
sweet or painful,

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,800
all I wish

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,960
is to meet you again.

(Three Years Ago)

28
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,190
Changfu,

29
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,550
how soon can we be back home?

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,320
We’re getting to town
in nearly four hours.

31
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,160
All right.

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,350
Don’t be anxious, Miss.

33
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,430
We’ll make it
to tonight’s Flower-wearing Banquet.

34
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,430
(Xiahou Xue)
You look more anxious than me.

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,880
Here you are.

36
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,380
(Love with Dragon)

37
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,910
What are you reading?

38
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,270
It’s... Look.

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,520
(Love with Dragon, Chapter 6)
This is the Dragon King.

40
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,070
This is a human girl.

41
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
After going through risks and hardships,

42
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,880
they finally live a happy life.

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,070
Miss.

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
Stop them! Be quick!

45
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,550
Miss, are you alright?

46
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,190
Stop!

47
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,470
Some refugees rushed out

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,960
and stopped us.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,160
I’ll go have a look.

50
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,680
Refugees?

51
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,910
What do you want?

52
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,680
Stop coming over!

53
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,400
Don’t be scared, Miss.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,750
I’ll protect you.

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,870
You... Go out!

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,630
Stay away!

57
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,120
Liuying! Liuying!

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,350
Don’t come over! Stay away!

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,750
Or I’ll beat you!

60
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,070
I’ll beat you!

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,030
I’m hungry.

62
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,310
You want this?

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you.

64
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,310
Wait a second.

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
Enjoy them.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,000
Share with your friends.

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,590
How poor they are!

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,240
Miss, how’s your foot?

69
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,560
I can’t move it.

70
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,440
Let me check on you.

71
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,280
All right.

72
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,310
Miss, the refugees left.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Shall we leave immediately?

74
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,720
Miss, I think you sprained your ankle.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,150
What do I do, then?

76
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,680
I’ll miss the Flower-wearing Banquet.

77
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,240
Only farmers live nearby.

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,800
We can’t find a doctor
unless we go back to town.

79
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,630
I’ve got an idea.

80
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,520
Changfu,

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
on our way here,

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,630
I saw some gardenia trees.

83
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,440
Go pick some gardenia fruits.

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,400
Ask Mr. Zhang to buy me
some eggs, flour and liquor

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
from neighboring farmers.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,750
All right. I’m going right away.

87
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,190
Miss, bear with the pain.

88
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,520
Liuying, what’s this?

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,310
Will it really cure me?

90
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,150
Don’t worry, Miss.

91
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,310
My father taught me this
when I was little.

92
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,520
It’ll work, I promise.

93
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,720
Done.

94
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,310
How do you feel, Miss?

95
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
I’m feeling better.

96
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,910
You’re awesome, Liuying!

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,840
That’s great.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,960
You can go to the Flower-wearing Banquet
in the best condition.

99
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,900
(Love with Dragon)

100
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,590
Don’t take such a ridiculous book

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
as real treasure.

102
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,030
If there were a real dragon,

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,030
mortals like us wouldn’t see it.

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,870
Miss, a dragon appears
and disappears mysteriously.

105
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,400
Maybe someday,

106
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,590
I can see a real dragon.

107
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,030
There’s a real dragon!

108
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,350
Miss, look!

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
There’s a dragon!

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
Yes. Yes, there is.

111
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,910
Why don’t you just marry a dragon?

112
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,620
(Yuchi Longyan)

113
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,060
(Immortal of Fate)

114
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,270
Dragon King, congratulations

115
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,270
on pulling through nine thunder strikes
in the second heavenly tribulation.

116
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
You often turn into a human shape,

117
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,120
but forget to wear clothes.

118
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,830
This is quite inappropriate.

119
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,390
If I were a girl,

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,030
I would be freaked out.

121
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,200
There’s never a girl
in my Dragon Pool.

122
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,470
Only you and I are here.

123
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
Don’t bother what I wear.

124
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,640
Or are you feeling ashamed

125
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,390
of your own body?

126
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
Come on.

127
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,350
Your heart was injured.

128
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
It’s minor injury.

129
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,590
Minor injury?

130
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,710
I’m afraid you can’t pull through

131
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,080
the third heavenly tribulation
in a couple of days.

132
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,240
After the last heavenly tribulation,

133
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,800
I can become the Immortal of Dragon.

134
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,080
I won’t give up the chance!

135
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,710
Come on.

136
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,640
Don’t try to pull a stunt like that.

137
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,510
If you wear Ancient Golden Armor,

138
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,800
you’ll make it
through the third heavenly tribulation.

139
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,320
Ancient Golden Armor
stolen from the Heavenly Palace?

140
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,910
You know where it is?

141
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,680
Double Demons have it.

142
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,000
I don’t think you can easily get it.

143
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,180
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

144
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
Good morning, Blue Bird.

145
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,150
Are you feeling better?

146
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,510
Let me apply some ointment for you.

147
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,200
You’ve totally recovered?

148
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,390
Good bird.

149
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,270
Blue Bird,

150
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,270
don’t fight other birds anymore.

151
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
If you get hurt again,

152
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,470
you may not meet me
or get helped once more.

153
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,910
Go back home.

154
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,150
Why are you back?

155
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,950
You brought the flower to me?

156
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,440
So, you want to exchange it
for the osmanthus cake?

157
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,760
There’s a cool fragrance
on this human girl.

158
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,470
Feels so good.

159
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,270
Don’t be scared. Don’t be scared.

160
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,590
Dragon King, what do you come for?

161
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,000
Yuchi Longyan, you want the Armor?
You’re dead meat!

162
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,560
Want to trap me?

163
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,800
Be careful, Miss.

164
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,320
I never knew the Fallen-flower Valley
behind the mountain

165
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,640
could be so beautiful!

166
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,440
I feel like in a dream!

167
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,830
Yeah.

168
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,390
How beautiful!

169
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,760
Miss, look, so many fallen flowers.

170
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,830
Miss,

171
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,120
how does this look?

172
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,390
The one I picked looks good.

173
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,390
They both look good.

174
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,800
What’s the noise?

175
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,470
Don’t be scared, Miss.

176
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,640
Let me go have a look.

177
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,800
Be careful.

178
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,270
Miss!

179
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
What happened?

180
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,110
Miss, look over there.

181
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,270
There’s a snake.

182
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,360
Snake?

183
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Why doesn’t it move?

184
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,800
I think it’s injured.

185
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,230
Injured?

186
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,560
The snake looks so beautiful.

187
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
However beautiful it is,
it’s a snake.

188
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,360
Such a beautiful snake must be precious.

189
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,390
Let’s take it back and try to save it.

190
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,200
Me?

191
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,840
But a snake bites people.

192
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,270
I was bitten when I was little.

193
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,960
From then on,

194
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,680
I was quite scared of snakes.

195
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,630
The Anti-Poison Ointment
my father brought back from the South...

196
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,030
Are you taking it with you?

197
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,200
Apply some

198
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,600
and snakes won’t bite you.

199
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,480
Look, it’s such a beautiful snake.

200
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,680
If you don’t save it, it’ll die.

201
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,150
Do you have the heart to see that?

202
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,440
All right, then.

203
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,800
Little snake,

204
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,990
I’m here to save you.

205
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,800
Be a good snake

206
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,750
and don’t bite me.

207
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,480
Smells so good.

208
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,270
Feels comfortable.

209
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,360
Why are you so cold?

210
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,800
Don’t bite me!

211
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,960
It’s a good snake. It won’t bite you.

212
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
Miss, let’s leave immediately.

213
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,150
Don’t bite me.

214
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
Where shall I put you?

215
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,870
What’s she doing?

216
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
How dare the human girl

217
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
keep me in a cage!

218
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,840
I don’t mean to keep you in a cage.

219
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,600
But I’m a bit timid.

220
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,230
I won’t be relieved
unless I put you in a cage.

221
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
You?

222
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,110
You don’t like to stay in the cage?

223
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,480
I...

224
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,600
I’ll let you out, then.

225
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,390
But you must promise me

226
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,990
you won’t bite me.

227
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,720
You don’t like your cage,

228
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,200
but you like my quilt?

229
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,960
It feels quite comfortable.

230
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,910
That’s my pillow!

231
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,080
All right, then.

232
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,910
I’ll let you sleep on my bed these days.

233
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,030
I’ll sleep on the ground.

234
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,150
But I must get my quilt back.

235
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,390
This is for you.

236
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,030
Come and sleep in it.

237
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,750
Let me apply some ointment for you.

238
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,800
Don’t move.

239
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
This is my father’s special ointment.

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,110
He’s a master of injury.

241
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,230
If...

242
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,480
If he hadn’t died early,

243
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,510
I would...

244
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,560
Father must have become an immortal

245
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,320
and kept protecting me.

246
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,230
Or how would I come to Xiahou’s Mansion

247
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,270
and grow up with Miss?

248
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,840
After talking to you,

249
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,910
I’m no longer so scared of you.

250
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,080
You look silvery white.

251
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,390
Shall I...?

252
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,110
Shall I call you Xiaobai?

253
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,750
Xiaobai.

254
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,990
Xiaobai, time for lunch.

255
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,390
Look what this is.

256
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,990
It’s... It’s a quail egg.

257
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,440
The steamed egg is mine, not yours.

258
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,800
This... This is yours.

259
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,390
What an odd wind!

260
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,320
Where’s Xiaobai?

261
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,800
Why can you move so fast
when you’re injured?

262
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,600
My steamed egg!

263
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,560
You...

264
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,440
Why do you like cooked food?

265
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,680
Miss.

266
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,510
You don’t want the rest?

267
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,680
I’ll put it away.

268
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,320
You’re the most gluttonous here.

269
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,360
It’s not for me,

270
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
but for the snake I saved.

271
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,750
A snake eats the cake?

272
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,320
Doesn’t a snake

273
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,270
only eat uncooked meat or eggs?

274
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,270
I feel strange, too.

275
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,840
The snake only eats cooked food or cake.

276
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,030
It doesn’t eat anything uncooked.

277
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,030
Did you ask the snake

278
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
if it would drink tea or eat candy?

279
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
I didn’t.

280
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,080
But we can have a try.

281
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,440
We can feed it

282
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,200
what Master brought back...

283
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,910
Durian candy.

284
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,230
You mean this?

285
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,750
My father said

286
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,390
durian was a good thing
from ﻿the Southeast Asia.

287
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,510
Only a fool like you doesn’t like it.

288
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,360
Miss,

289
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,960
shall I

290
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,150
bring the snake to you

291
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,110
so that you can have a look?

292
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,320
No, no.

293
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,720
My mother said

294
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,030
a white snake wasn’t very precious.

295
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,230
Don’t discuss with me

296
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,630
for the snake thing.

297
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,030
Xiaobai,

298
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
look what I’ve brought you!

299
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,230
Xiaobai,

300
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,360
look what I’ve brought you.

301
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,960
Look,

302
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,680
lotus crispy cake,

303
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,110
sweet rose cake,

304
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,390
and your favorite steamed egg.

305
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
What?

306
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,870
You don’t like it?

307
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,750
It’s the dinner for Miss Xiahou.

308
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,480
Do you find it too sweet

309
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,750
and you want some tea?

310
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,030
I’ll go make you some tea.

311
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,360
You finished it all?

312
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,990
You ate so much cake in a second.

313
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,750
Will you be choked to death?

314
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,800
Have some tea.

315
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,480
I see.

316
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,510
You don’t want to eat anything

317
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,320
in front of me?

318
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,270
You’re a mere snake.

319
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,960
You don’t want to look ugly when eating?

320
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
Dinner is over. Have a candy.

321
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,440
You like it?

322
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,110
What’s the strange taste?

323
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,510
I want to spit it out.

324
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,560
I don’t have more,
no matter how much you like it.

325
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,510
I got it from Miss.

326
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,230
If you like it,

327
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,270
I can ask Madam Li
to make some durian cake.

328
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,750
How can I spit it out
when she’s staring at me?

329
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,910
All right.

330
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,030
You had dinner and tea.

331
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,510
Time to go to bed.

332
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
I’ll sleep on the ground tonight

333
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,510
and you’ll enjoy the bed.

334
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,600
I’m not scared of you.

335
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,150
I just don’t know

336
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,680
if you’re a boy or a girl.

337
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,150
What if you’re a boy?

338
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,720
A boy and a girl
shouldn’t be too intimate, so...

339
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,230
What did she mean?

340
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
Did she want me

341
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,320
to kiss her?
