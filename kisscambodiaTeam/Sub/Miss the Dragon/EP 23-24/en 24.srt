=Episode 24=

17
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,990
What’s wrong with her?

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,390
She’s injured.

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,280
How?

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,710
Qingqing.

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,920
Hand off.

22
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,310
It’s time to give her medicine.

23
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,520
Leave it to the General.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,710
Listen to Long Yan.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
Then take good care of her.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,710
Don’t need your advice.

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,960
Don’t try to take advantage of her.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,160
What did you say?

29
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,910
I said,

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,910
do not try to take advantage of her.

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,550
General, I’ll see this gentleman out.

32
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,430
Qingqing.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,190
What’s wrong with your forehead?

34
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,550
It’s fine.

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,710
Didn’t you hear what she said?

36
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,910
I took advantage of Qingqing.

37
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,760
When did she have the right

38
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,910
to judge me and my Qingqing?

39
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,350
Your Qingqing?

40
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,320
Did she accept you?

41
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,160
She didn’t turn me down.

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,160
So maybe

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
she did.

44
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,350
You think so?

45
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,120
How long haven’t you met?

46
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,160
We...

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,600
You’re busy.

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,600
She’s idle but she never went to you.

49
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,470
I’m not optimistic about it.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,070
I don’t believe what you said.

51
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,160
Besides,

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,830
you said I’m a traveling physician.

53
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,040
Should I say you’re the lord
of Luofeng Pavilion?

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,720
Still hurts?

55
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,720
You did come as soon as
the meteor mark disappeared.

56
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,350
Tell me who hurt you.

57
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,630
No one.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
I will find him

59
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,030
and make sure he learns

60
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,800
the consequence of hurting my staff.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Actually,

62
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,030
it’s me.

63
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,120
You?

64
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,750
Why did you do that?

65
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,960
Because the mark was ugly.

66
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,280
It scared people off.

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,310
And spells couldn’t hide it.

68
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,870
It really bothered me when I saw it.

69
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,070
So I decided to cut it off.

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
You fool.

71
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,190
Forehead is where the third eye is
for our kind.

72
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,310
The meteor mark is a defect

73
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,680
of your beauty.

74
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,750
But what you did

75
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,440
will only weaken your power.

76
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,190
That is so reckless.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
I don’t care about the power,

78
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,000
or intend to become an immortal.

79
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,280
All I know is
that beauty is significant.

80
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,840
I don’t want anybody to dislike me.

81
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,190
Are you an idiot or what?

82
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,910
Who would dislike you for that?

83
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,870
Yes.

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,310
I’m an idiot and fool.

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,590
I’m stupid.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,630
So beauty is the last thing I got.

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,190
Without that,

88
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,800
what do I have?

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,310
If...

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,070
If you don’t like it,

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,150
leave me alone.

92
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,680
Go.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,750
Always like that. Disappear in a puff.

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,240
Goodbye.

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,440
A bird’s brain is small.

96
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,400
I didn’t think much.

97
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,590
Were it not for you,

98
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,630
would I even do that?

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,590
Didn’t you leave?

100
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,470
I went to tell Bingxing

101
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,470
to stop looking for the attacker

102
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,310
and get this for you by the way.

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,720
You’re no longer angry with me?

104
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,470
What’s the point of being angry?

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Now focus on how to prevent the scar.

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,120
(Dongluo Hall)

107
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,150
Your Highness,

108
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,800
the Seven-Gem Cutlass has...

109
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,240
It has been found by them.

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
Get up.

111
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,910
Are you done?

112
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,590
Yes.

113
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,240
A man who can’t even hide something

114
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,070
doesn’t deserve a life.

115
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,590
Calm down, Your Highness.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How?

117
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,870
If Feng Chenyue is chopped into pieces.

118
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,190
Can you do it?

119
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Feng Chenyue and her Sergeant At Arms

120
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,150
are tough.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,390
We should form a long-term plan.

122
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,080
Get up and turn around.

123
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
Get up and turn around.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
Yes.

125
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,760
I don’t want to do this.

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
You promised you’d never question me,
remember?

127
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,640
When I told you to kill someone,
you never dissented.

128
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,150
Forgive me for my incompetence.

129
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,710
Rui said Feng Chenyue and you
were childhood friends.

130
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,270
Is it true?

131
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,590
Yes.

132
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,910
Why didn’t you tell me?

133
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,880
Feng Chenyue and I

134
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,510
are no longer friends, but foes.

135
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,390
So, I didn’t report it to Your Highness.

136
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
I think you want reconciliation.

137
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,950
Is your heart soft?

138
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,510
Of course not.

139
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,680
Come here.

140
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,710
Come.

141
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,590
You remember who your foe

142
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,030
and your savior are, right?

143
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,510
I’ll always be in your debt.

144
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,710
Your Highness is my savior.

145
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,150
Look.

146
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,240
How bright the moon is tonight.

147
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,640
I’m a just man.

148
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,440
The punishment is this.

149
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,470
It’s full moon tonight.

150
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,200
So for the Life-saving Pill,

151
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
come and get it tomorrow.

152
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

153
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,760
Well,

154
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,030
what’s that physician’s name?

155
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,680
Which physician?

156
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,880
The one who took advantage of Qingqing.

157
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,710
He is Xue Qianxun,

158
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,830
a good man.

159
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,640
Sounds like
a traveling physician’s name.

160
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,470
How is he to Qingqing?

161
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,350
Trust me, General Feng.

162
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
His love to Qingqing is real.

163
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,150
If he ever mistreats Qingqing,

164
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,200
I’ll chop his arms off.

165
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,910
Jin.

166
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,000
Jin.

167
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,830
Jin, what’s wrong with you?

168
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,320
I don’t need your concern.

169
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
What happened?

170
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
You’re wounded.

171
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,350
Leave me alone.

172
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,350
I’m just a maid.

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
Thank you for your concern.

174
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,760
Jin.

175
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,470
Jin.

176
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,390
Leave me alone.

177
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,440
Jin.

178
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,460
(General’s Mansion)

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,710
This lady’s pulse is messy.

180
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,910
Forgive me for my incompetence.

181
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I can’t tell what disease this is.

182
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,440
Is there a way

183
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,510
to relieve her pain?

184
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,080
Then I’ll make some

185
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,440
Pain Numbing Soup for her

186
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,120
to kill the pain.

187
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,910
Thank you, Physician Lin.

188
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,830
I’m afraid she’s not ill,

189
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,320
but poisoned.

190
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,030
Poisoned?

191
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,800
The symptoms on her body

192
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,240
match my father’s description.

193
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,510
It’s a poison from Dongluo.

194
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,800
Mandrake.

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,680
Right.

196
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,390
Once poisoned,

197
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
you have to take in more

198
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,510
to relieve the pain.

199
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,710
Yes.

200
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
It’s a rare poison.

201
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,150
How were you poisoned?

202
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,710
General, it’s time for dinner.

203
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
You must stay strong.

204
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,240
Jin.

205
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,750
You’re awake.

206
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,230
You haven’t recovered yet.

207
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,630
None of your business.

208
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,560
Jin, you’re not ill.

209
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,600
You’re poisoned by Mandrake.

210
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,230
I don’t understand what you’re saying.

211
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,270
Stay here. I’ll find the cure.

212
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,870
I’m from Dongluo.

213
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,630
You should stay away from me.

214
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,910
You gave me this.

215
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,560
(Feng)
I’ve been keeping the commanding badge

216
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,840
in it.

217
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
(Jin)
Over the last years,

218
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,680
I’ve been carrying it with me

219
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
wherever I go.

220
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,680
When he took us there,

221
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,630
we found nothing but this.

222
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,020
(Feng)
The Fengs’ commanding badge.

223
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,700
(Feng)

224
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,800
Was it a fake?

225
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,870
Answer me. Do you know

226
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,630
that seven years ago,

227
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
my father was killed by your army

228
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,150
at Tiger’s Howl Valley?

229
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,870
Seven years ago?

230
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,440
We were not in war.

231
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,360
But my father’s death is a fact.

232
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,150
My wound is fully healed.

233
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,990
Thank you for your treatment.

234
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,080
I must go.

235
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,600
Jin.

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,110
Don’t take Mandrake again.

237
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,030
It stops the pain temporarily,

238
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,150
but will worsen it.

239
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,630
(Dongluo Hall)

240
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,110
You must hate me so much.

241
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,200
I dare not.

242
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,680
I just hope you learn

243
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
the lesson.

244
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,870
I deserve the punishment.

245
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,080
You can only get the Life-saving Pills
from me.

246
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,510
Remember?

247
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,600
I will not forget.

248
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

249
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,110
I’ll leave you.

250
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,900
(Dongluo Hall)

251
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,270
Your Highness.

252
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Mr. Guo,

253
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
when can I see

254
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,990
Feng Chenyue’s head off her body?

255
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,630
My patience is running out.

256
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,030
If we kill a general in the capital,

257
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,080
His Majesty will be alerted.

258
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,680
By then,

259
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,390
it’ll lead to us

260
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,230
and cause trouble.

261
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,990
Since she’s a general,

262
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,560
it is her fate

263
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,320
to die on the battlefield.

264
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,110
Don’t you agree?

265
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,360
Nanzhao State is attacking.

266
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
I’m thinking the South Army

267
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,870
isn’t as solid as the Feng Army.

268
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,840
You’re not ill.

269
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,750
You’re poisoned by Mandrake.

270
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,680
Mandrake?

271
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
(Feng)
I’ve been keeping the commanding badge

272
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,840
in it.

273
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,990
(Jin)
I’ve been carrying it over the years

274
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,800
wherever I go.

275
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,560
Was the badge

276
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,320
really the Fengs’ commanding badge?

277
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
This is the eldest prince.

278
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,030
When he took us there,

279
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,390
we found nothing but this.

280
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,740
(Feng)

281
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,600
The Fengs’ commanding badge.

282
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Father,

283
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
were you really killed by the Fengs?

284
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,720
Don’t take Mandrake again.

285
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,230
It stops the pain temporarily,

286
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,960
but will worsen it.

287
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,150
Why does the pill have to go down

288
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,440
with liquor, instead of water?

289
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,480
What if it’s put in water?

290
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,560
Smells good.

291
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,480
Why?

292
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,800
Your Majesty!

293
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,360
Your Majesty!

294
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,870
Your Majesty!

295
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,910
Your Majesty, Nanzhao State attacks.

296
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,990
I just learned from the emergency report

297
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,110
that General Lin was killed in action.

298
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,910
Please assign
another commanding general.

299
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,510
Who do you think we should assign?

300
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,150
I volunteer to go to the south now.

301
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,260
(General’s Mansion)

302
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,720
Lu Zheng.

303
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,800
I’ll go with you.

304
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,080
I’m granted the position

305
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,560
as the Military Supervisor of the south.

306
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,910
And His Majesty permitted Deputy Zhao

307
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,440
to lead reinforcements to the south.

308
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,150
Uncle Zhao is also going?

309
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,600
Fantastic.

310
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,910
He’ll give a pair of wings to our army.

311
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,440
You just came back

312
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,680
for a few peaceful days.

313
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,440
Why would you go back to battlefield?

314
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,150
I’ll go

315
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,480
wherever you go.

316
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,030
We’ll be together forever.

317
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,600
Good.

318
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,750
We will win the war.

319
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
I’ll meet with someone.

320
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,480
Be careful.

321
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,960
Don’t worry.

322
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,100
(Jin)

323
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,080
Jin.

324
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,200
Stop.

325
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,840
It’s really you.

326
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,320
You look much better.

327
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,600
Take care

328
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,200
in Nanzhao.

329
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,270
Alright.

330
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,720
I’m not worried about you.

331
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,030
It’s a warning.

332
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,030
What do you mean?

333
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
That’s all I can tell you.

334
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,720
Good luck to you.

335
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,960
Dangers are lurking in Nanzhao.

336
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,630
I want you to peel your eyes.

337
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,840
Yes.

338
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,910
We just arrived.

339
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,230
It’s not wise to attack
with the situation unclear.

340
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,270
In wars, speed is the key.

341
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,720
If we attack now,

342
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,560
I’m sure we’ll catch them by surprise.

343
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,320
Uncle Zhao, what’s your opinion?

344
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,510
I came all the way from the north

345
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,840
not to sit on the bench.

346
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,720
I surely want to stretch my limbs,
so go!

347
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,870
Alright.

348
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,270
But take it easy.

349
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,960
If we burn their provisions
and provender,

350
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
their men and horses will starve

351
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,080
and in the end withdraw.

352
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,390
We adopted the tactic on Dongluo Army.

353
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,080
But the south is ample with
wild fruits and grass, I’m afraid...

354
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,510
Don’t worry. I’ll poison the woods.

355
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,720
The plants will wither in three days

356
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,870
and become inedible.

357
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,200
Good idea. Move out.

358
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,630
Let’s go.

359
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,680
Keep firing.

360
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,630
Fire! The provisions are on fire!

361
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,390
Put it out! Hurry!

362
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,390
Hurry. Hurry.

363
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,840
General, the provisions are burnt.

364
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,870
We can withdraw now.

365
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,390
General.

366
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,840
Fall back!

367
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:16,720
Charge!

368
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,360
Split up in two.

369
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,200
Come this way.

370
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,360
Yes. Go!

371
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,440
Get them!

372
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,870
-Come on!
-Don’t let her run away.

373
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,230
-Go!
-Faster!

374
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,110
Long Yan,

375
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,080
lead the men to fight a way out!

376
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,320
Gao Yang!

377
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,390
General, go!

378
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,230
Gao Yang!

379
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,360
Chenyue!

380
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,630
♪In the reincarnation of lives♪
