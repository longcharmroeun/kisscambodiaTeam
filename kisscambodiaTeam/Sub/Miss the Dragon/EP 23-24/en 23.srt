17
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,260
(Puer tea)

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,350
Just now,

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
you dodged it fast.

20
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,670
So I said your skills
aren’t sharp enough.

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,200
After all these years,

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,990
your aim is still so bad.

23
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,480
Seems that

24
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,920
you’re not doing so well
in the underworld.

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,110
My aim is bad?

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,190
You might be the only person

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,350
who dares to say that
in the four nations.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,830
Really?

29
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,240
When we first met,

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,320
I learnt how good you were.

31
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,430
Have you forgotten?

32
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,240
You came to Wind City from Dongluo

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,550
all by yourself.

34
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,400
You look so thin.

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,240
And you?

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,240
What brings you here?

37
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,350
And you know the Crown Prince.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
It seems you’re

39
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
much smarter than before.

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,680
Do you mean I was foolish?

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
Who was it that couldn’t unlock
the labyrinth casket

42
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,960
and asked for my help?

43
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,990
It’s getting late.

44
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,520
Have dinner with me.

45
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,550
No, thanks.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,470
I have business to attend to today.

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,910
-Tomorrow...
-Tomorrow...

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,630
See you tomorrow.

49
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,240
At noon

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,800
and here.

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Prime Minister.

52
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,350
Prince Yun, His Majesty is delighted

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,630
that you come
to his birthday celebration

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,160
and orders me to welcome you.

55
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,990
When His Majesty sees my gift

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
on the banquet,

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,120
he’ll be exhilarated.

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,760
For this precious gift,

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,910
I ordered my guards

60
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,800
to watch it around the clock,

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,430
in case anyone steals it.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,990
Prince Yun, you’re in Wind City now.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,040
Please wait for His Majesty’s
birthday banquet.

64
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,240
Sure.

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,430
Please.

66
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,350
Please.

67
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,870
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,630
Dongluo Crown Prince has

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,070
a priceless gift

70
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,720
for your birthday.

71
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,240
It’s a cutlass decorated with gems.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,000
It’s said to be the treasure of
the previous dynasty.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,470
The treasure of the previous dynasty?

74
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,720
So seven years ago,

75
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,870
the winner of the treasure hunt

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,800
at Tiger’s Howl Valley
was Dongluo State.

77
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,440
Your Majesty, is it

78
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,440
the Seven-Gem Cutlass that marks

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,720
the sovereignty over the world?

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,240
Well it seems

81
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,910
Dongluo State has come with sincerity.

82
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,750
They’re our guests.

83
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,120
As the super power of the world,

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
we must make them feel at home.

85
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,280
Throw a grand welcoming banquet.

86
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,350
All high-rank officials must attend.

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,840
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,030
I’m afraid

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,910
I’d better not attend the banquet.

90
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,440
General Feng,

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,720
are your defying His Majesty’s order?

92
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,070
General Feng wounded
the Crown Prince’s eye.

93
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,870
He’ll be irritated

94
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,310
to see General Feng.

95
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,240
Your Majesty are so wise.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,750
Your Majesty are so wise.

97
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,420
(Yue)

98
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,030
Your Grace,

99
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,400
General Feng seeks your audience.

100
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,590
Invite her in.

101
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,310
She can come without report next time.

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,310
Yes.

103
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,470
Your Grace.

104
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,470
I kept my promise to visit you.

105
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,030
It’s nice of you to keep your promise.

106
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,030
Take a seat.

107
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,280
(Yue)

108
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,240
Labyrinth casket?

109
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,150
Yes, you know it?

110
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,750
Your Grace,

111
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,520
how did you get it?

112
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,120
My maid Jin made it.

113
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,590
Jin?

114
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,520
Your Grace, where is she?

115
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,870
Can I see her?

116
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,560
Jin...

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,070
She went to Xingyuan Pastry

118
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,750
to buy bean paste cakes.

119
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,910
Look, she’s back.

120
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,720
General Feng, you know my maid?

121
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,350
General Feng?

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,910
You...

123
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,310
You’re General Feng

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,750
who defeated Dongluo?

125
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,070
Jin,

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,560
you came to Wind City from Dongluo

127
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,240
with Consort Rui?

128
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,470
Aren’t you a wanderer?

129
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,630
That is my dream.

130
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,350
You can be a general.

131
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,960
So can I be a maid.

132
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,750
That’s the difference between
reality and dream.

133
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,280
Jin, you know General Feng?

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,350
I’m Jin. Pleasure, General Feng.

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,280
I didn’t know you’re the lady general.

136
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,590
If I offended you, please forgive me.

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,720
Jin,

138
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,440
we’re friends. No need to apologize.

139
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
I’m sorry I had to lie to you.

140
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,750
But it was my father’s order.

141
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,630
Jin,

142
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,310
no matter what,

143
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,190
our friendship is not changed.

144
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,470
You’ve not changed, General Feng.

145
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,830
But I have.

146
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,800
I’ll leave you to it.

147
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,320
You...

148
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,240
You two...

149
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,350
Your Grace,

150
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,240
she’s my childhood friend.

151
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,940
(Yue)

152
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,060
(Yue)

153
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,000
Your Highness.

154
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,590
It’s not full moon now.

155
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,510
The agony strikes early this time.

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,510
Is anything bothering you?

157
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,880
I feel guilty about not being able

158
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,510
to blind Feng Chenyue’s eyes.

159
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,640
It’s not like you.

160
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,880
There are things you cannot complete?

161
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,240
I...

162
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,150
I didn’t do my best.

163
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,880
I don’t know why.

164
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,680
But from your looks, I can feel

165
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,270
you’re hiding something from me.

166
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,830
I’m sorry, Your Highness.
Please punish me.

167
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,000
It’s not a big deal.

168
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,950
Who killed your father?

169
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,200
The Fengs.

170
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,950
Who wounded my eye?

171
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,830
Also the Fengs.

172
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Take it.

173
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,030
Thank you, Your Highness.

174
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,590
You’re welcome.

175
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,710
I’ll stay more days
for the birthday banquet.

176
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,880
In the meantime,

177
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
I need your cooperation

178
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,270
to get the Fengs’ commanding badge.

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,350
You know how.

180
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,120
Your Highness and Feng Chenyue
don’t see eye to eye.

181
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,240
Everybody in Wind City knows it.

182
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
To frame her with her badge

183
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,880
doesn’t seem a good idea.

184
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,270
If I’m right,

185
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,000
this is the first time you

186
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,270
question me.

187
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,710
Forgive me, Your Highness.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,150
I’ll spare you this time.

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,000
But never...

190
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,710
Never...

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,710
Never do it again, alright?

192
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,200
Yes.

193
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,440
All I need is for Feng Chenyue
to be investigated.

194
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,320
I have hands in the Ministry of Justice.

195
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you think she can get out?

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
No, I don’t think so.

197
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you think?

198
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,270
I’ll do as told, Your Highness.

199
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,910
Tell Rui to invite Feng Chenyue over.

200
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,910
Yes.

201
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,710
Let them talk.

202
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,740
(Yue)

203
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,510
Why did they kill my father?

204
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,030
(Feng)
Remember the hatred.

205
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,500
(Yue)

206
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,700
(General’s Mansion)

207
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,000
That’s it.

208
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,590
Ice-cold face, no expression.

209
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,440
My suitor? It’s a lie.

210
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,270
The saying is right.

211
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,800
I’d rather believe there are ghosts

212
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,350
than words coming out of a man’s mouth.

213
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,800
Fortunately, I didn’t take it seriously.

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,390
Or, my pure feelings

215
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,910
would be hurt again.

216
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,760
I’ll make you sorry.

217
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,710
Don’t dodge.

218
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,560
Face it.

219
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,200
Stay put.

220
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,710
I’m sure the stone can hit you.

221
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,710
Also missed.

222
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,830
Even the stone stands in my way.

223
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,680
Hey, what are you looking at?

224
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,830
I didn’t ask you to look at my meteor mark.

225
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,560
Your Grace, it’s dark.

226
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,950
I should leave.

227
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,800
Are you leaving so soon?

228
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,470
Have another cup of tea.

229
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,710
No thanks. I’ll come on another day.

230
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,910
Alright.

231
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,510
General Feng, it’s unintentional.

232
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,030
General Feng, are you burnt?

233
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,320
Summon a physician.

234
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,150
I’m fine. There’s no need.

235
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,440
Don’t call the physician.

236
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
The tea is boiling hot.
Maybe you’re burnt.

237
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,000
Please undress and check it.

238
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,000
Right. Right.

239
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,440
Jin, go with her.

240
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,320
Yes.

241
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
I’m fine, really.

242
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,350
Just go with her.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,470
General, this way.

244
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,180
(General’s Mansion)

245
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,700
(Feng)

246
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,270
General Feng,

247
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,960
let me apply the balm for you.

248
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,270
I can do it.

249
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,630
You’re a general. I’m a maid.

250
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,030
Please let me do my job.

251
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
Jin,

252
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
can you stop acting like a stranger?

253
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,560
I’m from Dongluo.

254
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,080
You should keep safe distance from me.

255
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,390
The war is over.

256
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,230
You and I are friends for years.

257
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,360
It doesn’t matter.

258
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,680
You’re a general.

259
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,030
I’m a maid.

260
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,200
The rank keeps us apart.

261
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,600
But your father

262
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,270
was also a general in Dongluo.

263
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,840
Jin,

264
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,720
why did you leave your home

265
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,150
to be a maid here?

266
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,600
My father died in the war.

267
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,230
I’m homeless now.

268
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,560
I’m sorry.

269
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,230
General, your clothes are dry.

270
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,150
Let me help you dress up.

271
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,510
There, General.

272
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,360
(Feng)
Take the badge.

273
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,440
You can come to

274
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,990
my mansion to visit at anytime

275
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,320
with this.

276
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,020
(Feng)

277
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,560
I’m just a maid too humble

278
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,390
to step in the General’s Mansion.

279
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,390
Please take it back, General.

280
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,750
I’ll leave you.

281
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,600
Qingqing,

282
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,030
look what I have for you.

283
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,720
Bean paste cakes, osmanthus cakes

284
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,870
and pumpkin cakes,

285
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,110
all your favorites.

286
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,750
What’s up?

287
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,720
Nothing.

288
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,080
Nothing?

289
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,390
You didn’t ever look at
your favorite cakes.

290
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,870
Tell me. What’s wrong?

291
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,390
Let me ask you.

292
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,630
If you detest something

293
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,270
that you can’t get rid of,
what will you do?

294
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,990
Something you detest
but can’t get rid of.

295
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,750
What is it?

296
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,680
It’s...

297
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,200
Anyway, if you’re stuck with it

298
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,720
and can’t get rid of it,
what will you do?

299
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,510
This is

300
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,680
a difficult question.

301
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Let me see.

302
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,870
I’ll put it in this way.

303
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,680
If you have tails in combat,

304
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,510
and the battle is terribly fierce,

305
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,840
the best way out

306
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,150
is to blow the enemies
with thunder cannon.

307
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,390
But the thunder cannon

308
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
will cause casualties on your side too.

309
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,390
If you were commanding,
would you use it?

310
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,030
For victory, I’d have to.

311
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,960
Right.

312
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,200
On the battlefield,
victory is the only goal.

313
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,270
Better a little loss than a long fight.

314
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,030
So cut the losses.

315
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,910
Better a little loss than a long fight.

316
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,100
Your Highness.

317
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,260
(Dongluo Hall)

318
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,860
We got it.

319
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,100
(Dongluo Hall)

320
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,480
(Dongluo Hall)

321
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,360
Great.

322
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,750
Any casualties?

323
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,720
Your Majesty,

324
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,990
Dongluo Crown Prince
was slightly wounded

325
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,910
but many of his guards were killed.

326
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,390
And,

327
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,200
the Seven-Gem Cutlass to Your Majesty

328
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,630
is stolen.

329
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,680
Dongluo Crown Prince is attacked
in the capital.

330
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,150
Send as many men as needed

331
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,720
and find out the truth.

332
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,600
Yes.

333
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,200
Mr. Guo of Justice

334
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,230
is investigating in Dongluo Hall.

335
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,360
I’ll supervise it personally.

336
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,200
Your Majesty.

337
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,230
Any leads?

338
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,990
Your Majesty, look.

339
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,680
Your Majesty,

340
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,150
these men

341
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,360
were the Crown Prince’s personal guards.

342
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,720
He must have grabbed

343
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,390
the badge on the assassin

344
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,800
before being killed.

345
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,150
(Feng)

346
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,180
(Feng)
This is...

347
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,020
(Feng)

348
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,270
The Fengs’ commanding badge?

349
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,720
Your Majesty.

350
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,200
It’s...

351
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,440
Impossible.

352
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,110
General Feng,

353
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,390
take a look.

354
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,110
Feng Chenyue, look closer.

355
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,270
Is this your commanding badge?

356
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,390
In fact the jade badge...

357
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,600
What else can you say, General Feng?

358
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
The evidence is solid.

359
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,080
Your Majesty,

360
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,680
are you going to protect her?

361
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,390
General Feng,

362
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,360
is this your commanding badge?

363
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,960
Your Majesty,

364
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,390
it does belong to my family.

365
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,560
Feng Chenyue,

366
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,910
now that you admit it’s your badge,

367
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,110
why did you steal the Seven-Gem Cutlass?

368
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,910
Do you want to be
the ruler of the world?

369
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,390
Watch your tongue, Mr. Guo.

370
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
I said the badge belongs to my family.

371
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,270
But I never said it’s
the commanding badge.

372
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,680
Feng Chenyue,

373
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,440
I can’t believe you’re still
trying to justify yourself.

374
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,390
First,

375
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,910
it’s not the commanding badge.

376
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,720
Second,

377
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,320
someone must have stolen it

378
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,960
and framed me for it.

379
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,720
How innocent you are.

380
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,600
What is it if it’s not
your commanding badge?

381
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,680
You don’t believe her blatant lies,

382
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,960
do you, Your Majesty?

383
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,680
General Feng,

384
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,800
do you have proof?

385
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,080
Please come to my mansion,

386
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,680
and you’ll see the proof.

387
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,100
(General’s Mansion)

388
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,030
Your Majesty, just a moment.

389
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,700
(Feng)

390
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,260
(Feng)
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

391
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,740
(Feng)

392
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,150
So many identical jade badges.

393
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,990
Your Majesty,

394
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,600
since there are so many,

395
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,720
it can’t be the Fengs’ commanding badge.

396
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,080
Your Majesty,

397
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,800
when my father was alive,

398
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,680
each time we returned from the border,

399
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,150
there were men
trying to steal the badge.

400
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,560
So I ordered

401
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
these fakes to be made for the thieves.

402
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,110
They’ll stop when they get it.

403
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,110
These jade badges

404
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,440
are made specially

405
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,720
for the thieves with sinister motives.

406
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,960
Beyond the fine jade they’re made of,

407
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,990
the badges are worthless,

408
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,750
not to mention the commanding badge.

409
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,840
Prince Yun,

410
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,680
these can perfectly

411
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,390
prove General Feng’s innocence.

412
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,480
I agree that someone framed her.

413
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,840
Prince Yun,

414
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,230
do you agree?

415
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,600
Framed soon after returning,

416
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,390
it seems you have many foes.

417
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,080
When was I ever

418
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,680
afraid of foes?

419
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,030
One

420
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,720
at a time,

421
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,910
I’ll finish them off.

422
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,030
Really?

423
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,510
General Feng, I swear

424
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,680
I’ll find the truth

425
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,150
and the man who is so bold

426
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,030
to frame you.

427
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,200
Yes.

428
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,720
And the cutlass, find it.

429
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,870
Your Majesty,

430
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,150
I’ve searched Dongluo Hall.

431
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,870
Though the thieves’ footsteps are messy,

432
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,110
I can tell them apart.

433
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,990
But what’s odd is

434
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,870
there are no footsteps leaving
across the wall,

435
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,320
which means

436
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,800
the thieves didn’t escape
with the cutlass.

437
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,510
So you mean...

438
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,960
The cutlass is still in the hall.

439
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,630
Find it.

440
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,480
Take men to find it.

441
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,780
(General’s Mansion)

443
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,440
It’s your fault. It’s your fault.

444
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,360
Better a little loss than a long fight.

445
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,960
So cut the losses.

446
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,480
Yeah.

447
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,990
Better a little loss than a long fight.

448
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,480
Today,

449
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,600
I have to remove you.

450
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,800
My Lord, are you alright?

451
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,800
Qingqing is in danger.

452
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,480
Qingqing, Qingqing.

453
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,870
Qingqing.

454
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
Qingqing.

455
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,270
Who hurt you?

456
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,270
It’s you.

457
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,360
You won’t

458
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,110
be scared off by it again.

459
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,360
Who is it?

460
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,360
My Lord,
I’ve searched miles around here.

461
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,150
No signs of demons,

462
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,560
immortals or beasts.

463
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,870
Keep searching.

464
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,030
Anyone who came left a trace.

465
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,200
I will find the attacker.

466
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,560
Yes.

467
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,800
Qingqing.

468
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Let her go.

469
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,750
General.

470
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,600
This gentleman and Qingqing

471
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,480
love each other.

472
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,230
When did it happen?

473
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,750
How come you know and I don’t?

474
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,990
You were busy with work lately, so...

475
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,480
So this makes sense?

476
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,960
He’s a traveling physician

477
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,720
and is curing Qingqing.

478
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,320
What’s wrong with her?

479
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,800
She’s injured.

480
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,600
How?

481
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,960
Qingqing.

482
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,150
Hand off.

483
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,680
It’s time to give her medicine.

484
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,840
Leave it to the General.

485
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,960
Listen to Long Yan.

486
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,510
Then take good care of her.

487
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,840
Don’t need your advice.

488
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,360
Don’t try to take advantage of her.

489
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,320
What did you say?

490
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,230
I said,

491
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,200
do not try to take advantage of her.
