=Episode 11=

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,750
She’s born. Liuying is back!

18
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,160
I miss her so much!

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,750
Hey, why would Liuying choose this place

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,520
to be born?

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,480
Yuchi Town.

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,200
What about it?

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,680
Yuchi.

24
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,990
Is it because this village has

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
the same name with you

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,710
that she chose to be born here?

27
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,070
One way or another,

28
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,990
Liuying chose me in the end.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
Got it?

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,240
Does your wound hurt again?

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
You haven’t fully recovered.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
I’ve told you

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,910
not to come until you get recovered.

34
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,630
But I have to be with her.

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,120
You have me here.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,400
Moreover, her name is no longer Liuying.

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,470
Don’t worry. I’ll take good care of her.

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,270
How about this?

39
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,160
We can disguise as families

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,550
and live in this village. Right?

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
Yes! Yes! That’s great!

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,240
You’ll be my maid

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,270
for a century.

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,070
You and I

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,800
to be families?

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,910
Do you want to marry me?

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,760
No! No! I can’t do that!

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,190
Who would marry you?

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,830
To be siblings.

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,860
(18 Years Later)

51
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,660
(Yuchi Town)

52
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,040
Hope the osmanthus cakes
of this new restaurant

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
can be as tasty as that in the capital.

54
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,910
It’s you!

55
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,430
Why are you here?

56
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,120
You know Ayu is here,

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,590
so you come for her?

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,960
I’m here for my fugitive maid.

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
Your Highness! Your Highness!

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,240
Your Highness!

61
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,120
He...

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,560
He... He wants to take Ayu’s soul!

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,350
When did my maid have Three-call Spell

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,590
with Dragon King,

65
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,240
the demonic skill?

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,000
You come upon being called.

67
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,800
You. Come here.

68
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,440
Your Highness.

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,720
He must be here for Ayu’s soul!

70
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,960
I’ll count to three.

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,630
Come or I’ll take your soul.

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,840
One, two, three!

73
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,470
You...

74
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,000
Qingqing.

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,440
Go over there.

76
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,280
But I...

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,520
I am here.

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Ayu will be fine.

79
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,310
You came by his order.

80
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,520
Now I don’t want you to come.

81
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,280
Go make Silver Needle tea for me.

82
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,800
No additives.

83
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,030
You are fooling me.

84
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,630
I’ll go then.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,070
We worked together to mend the sky net.

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
It can hold for a century.

87
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,520
Why didn’t you tell Qingqing

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,910
you don’t need Ayu’s soul for now?

89
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,310
A century is a short time.

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,720
Things are unpredictable.

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,800
I didn’t promise

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,870
I’d never take your lover’s soul.

93
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,840
Besides, why should I tell it

94
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,960
to a maid?

95
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,350
You seem to

96
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,070
specially come for Qingqing today.

97
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,680
Heavenly Soldiers have been

98
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,150
going after Blood Devil.

99
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,560
I passed by

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
and thought of the maid.

101
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,520
I came to warn that bird demon

102
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,120
who can’t use magic.

103
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,560
She should keep a low key.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,150
You come personally

105
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,910
for this trivial matter?

106
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,750
Do you love Qingqing?

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,840
How is that possible?

108
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,680
You must be jealous.

109
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,240
I’m sure you love her.

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,910
I’ve never known

111
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,680
how it feels to love someone.

112
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,350
It’s hard indeed.

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,310
Maybe because I’m intelligent.

114
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,350
It didn’t take me much time

115
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,240
to understand the mortal love.

116
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,310
Look.

117
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,310
I can teach you if you want to learn.

118
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,630
I don’t need an injured dragon

119
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,280
to teach me.

120
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,870
My injury is almost healed.

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
Alright. You’re good.

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,310
Keep waiting here

123
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,440
for your girl.

124
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,120
I will quit bothering you.

125
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,280
(Ruan Ayu)

126
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,630
Here. It’s fresh.

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,680
Thanks.

128
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,400
Thank you.

129
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,120
(Royal Notice)

130
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,030
I was worried about the drought.

131
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,520
A Goddess came into my dream at night.

132
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,000
Then the rain fell.
The Goddess is in the southeast.

133
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,150
If the Goddess of Rain can be found,

134
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,120
she’ll be rewarded with
gold, silver, satin and jewelry,

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,910
and conferred as a Princess.

136
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,440
Conferred as a Princess?

137
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,350
“Goddess is in the southeast.”

138
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,390
Our Yuchi Town is in the southeast.

139
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,590
Miss Yuxiang, that Goddess

140
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,030
is likely to be you.

141
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,950
(Liu Yuxiang Baldhead)
Who else could it be if not me?

142
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,350
Absolutely.

143
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,910
The last fresh fish!

144
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,910
Fish!

145
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,510
How much is the fish?

146
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,640
Three copper coins per tael.

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,120
It’s the last one.
A discount for you.

148
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,560
Okay. I’ll take it.

149
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,590
Okay.

150
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,510
Take care.

151
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,560
Here.

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,950
She’s known

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
as a jinx.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,470
She got her mother killed.

155
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,830
Buying her fish,

156
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,120
you’ll be in bad luck.

157
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,270
What? Is it true?

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Mrs. Sun. Don’t listen to her nonsense.

159
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,150
I’m telling the truth.

160
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,880
Her fish will make your family die
from sickness.

161
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,710
Aren’t you afraid?

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,080
-Sick!
-You...!

163
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
And the plants will wither.

164
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,000
Wither.

165
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
So lucky?

166
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,030
No, I won’t buy it.

167
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,000
-Mrs. Sun!
-No.

168
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,200
I won’t buy it.

169
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,000
You jinx,

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,150
no one will buy your fish.

171
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,000
Never mind. I’ll eat it myself.

172
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,120
Eat it yourself.

173
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,320
Excuse me.

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
Yuxiang, are you alright?

175
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,030
You poured water at me!

176
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,320
Your skirt is wet.

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,910
You smell fishy.

178
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,200
You’re fishy.

179
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,350
What’s wrong with you?

180
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,590
I...

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,080
Hey... Gentleman.

182
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,270
-Let’s talk.
-Get away.

183
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,830
-Let’s talk.
-Watch out.

184
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,950
Are you alright?

185
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
I’m fine.

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,830
Come if you dare.

187
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,910
Yuxiang, I got a lump.

188
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,080
Who is it?

189
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,760
Zhiyong.

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,710
If you dare to bully girls again,

191
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,200
(Zhiyong)
I’ll break your baldhead!

192
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,270
Get lost!

193
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,470
What is it to do with you?

194
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,590
Baldhead.

195
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,800
Zhiyong asked you to leave. Go now.

196
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,760
Okay.

197
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,470
Thank you, Zhiyong.

198
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,470
You are welcome. Let me help you.

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,710
Father. I’m back.

200
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,000
Ayu is back.

201
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,350
Dinner is ready.

202
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,710
Father, let me do it.

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,710
Please sit.

204
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,560
It smells good.

205
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,510
(Ruan Yueshan)
Only my sweet girl

206
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,000
(Ruan Yueshan)
likes my salted fish and vegetables.

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
Father, I earned three more
copper coils today.

208
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,760
I’ll cook good dishes for you tomorrow.

209
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,880
You are a good girl.

210
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,240
I’m blessed

211
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,240
to have a good daughter like you.

212
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,590
Father, eat.

213
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,120
Ayu, eat the fish.

214
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,560
Eat, Father.

215
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,800
Let’s eat together.

216
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,640
Get away!

217
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,710
Watch out.

218
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,950
Right ahead!

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,950
This way!

220
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,950
More people are dead!

221
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,000
Here! Here!

222
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,470
Look! Look!

223
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,760
Plus these two,
five girls have been killed,

224
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,440
not for money or lust.

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,080
Only for girls’ heart.

226
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,440
There must be a demon in town!

227
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
It must be Father
who put the quilt on me.

228
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,150
It’s so beautiful.

229
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,440
Why do we pick flowers

230
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,120
at such a remote place?

231
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,270
It’s empty. No one is here.

232
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,440
It’s dangerous.

233
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,080
Flowers here are beautiful and big,

234
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,510
with so many categories.

235
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,440
Look, so beautiful.

236
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,510
These flowers are beautiful.

237
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
But I heard

238
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,710
many girls went missing lately.

239
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,640
There could be a pervert.

240
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
We are beautiful like flowers.

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,710
We’ll be targeted by the pervert.

242
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,590
Really?

243
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,590
-Ayu.
-Catch the pervert!

244
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,270
Ayu.

245
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,830
On your feet.

246
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,910
Let’s go.

247
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,880
Wait.

248
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,350
We get lost.

249
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,590
Someone is watching us.

250
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,830
Dragon King. Dragon King.

251
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,680
-Let’s go over there. Hurry!
-Dragon King.

252
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,150
Ayu! Run!

253
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,320
Dragon King. Dragon King. Dragon King.

254
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,600
Zhiyong. Why are you here?

255
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,630
Are you alright?

256
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,360
I... I’m fine.

257
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,390
Ayu.

258
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,840
Ayu.

259
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,360
Wake up, Ayu.

260
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,270
Ayu. Wake up, Ayu.

261
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,560
Ayu.

262
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,560
Crap. Dragon King is jealous.

263
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,360
Wake up.

264
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,600
You are a man.

265
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,030
Let me do it.

266
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
Ayu.

267
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,150
Ayu.

268
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,080
Ayu.

269
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,990
Zhiyong.

270
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,360
What brings you here?

271
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,870
I was hunting nearby.

272
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
This demon’s heart was pierced
by my arrow.

273
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,390
Did...? Did you kill...?

274
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,480
No.

275
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,320
That demon was stunned by Dragon...

276
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,600
Stunned by me...

277
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,750
By me.

278
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,840
You?

279
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,600
We must leave here now.

280
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,030
Ayu. Get on my back.

281
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,720
Hey...

282
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,390
Dragon King, don’t be angry.

283
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,960
I’m going to look after her. Ayu!

284
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,960
Well, I caught a wolf cub.

285
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,110
I’ll show you tomorrow

286
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
to calm you down.

287
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,510
Great. Thank you, Zhiyong.

288
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,150
Don’t mention it.

289
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,910
Your Highness.

290
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,910
How is she?

291
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,800
She had a soothing pill

292
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,870
and went to sleep.

293
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,800
And that... That person.

294
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,030
I’ve driven him home.

295
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,320
Don’t worry.

296
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,990
But

297
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,560
why did you hide away every time?

298
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,840
Isn’t it good

299
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
to help her openly?

300
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,440
The Immortal warned me

301
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,030
not to be close to Ayu.

302
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,510
Just because you can’t love.

303
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,750
They make up so many executes.

304
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,390
Those immortals

305
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,840
just don’t want demons

306
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,030
to be friends with human.

307
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,720
I’ve been with Ayu all the time.

308
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,680
Isn’t she very well?

309
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,440
Since you can’t care about Ayu,

310
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,080
why don’t you let Zhiyong do it?

311
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,080
No!

312
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,030
Hello, Uncle.

313
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,910
Where is Ayu?

314
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,150
Are you looking for Ayu?

315
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,030
She went to see the wolf cub
with Zhiyong.

316
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,030
I told her not to go.

317
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,440
She’s so playful.

318
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,270
Yes, she likes having fun.

319
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,600
Uncle, I’m off.

320
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,870
Won’t you stay for a while?

321
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,960
No.

322
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,680
Wolves are fierce,

323
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,600
but the cub is lovely.

324
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,990
Am I right, Zhiyong?

325
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,230
Here.

326
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,840
Eat.

327
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,230
You don’t eat?

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,960
Blood Devil, you’ve hidden
in human’s heart for 20 years.

329
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,910
You thought we couldn’t find you.

330
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,600
You can’t get away this time.

331
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,720
Your power improved quite a lot.

332
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,560
More than that.

333
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
I will be immortal.

334
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,990
Bah!

335
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,630
I’m not even immortal.

336
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,440
How dare you say that, my grandchild?

337
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Barrier.

338
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:52,990
No!

339
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,320
Dragon King. Dragon King. Dragon King.

340
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,390
Hurry.

341
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,480
Your Highness. Ayu is in the cave.

342
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,680
It won’t work.

343
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,680
I just got the demon-slaying edict
from Heavenly Emperor to Three Realms.

344
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,910
One of the two barriers is here.

345
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,390
The other one is in the cave.
No one can break them.

346
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,150
What to do?

347
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,600
I don’t care about Heavenly Emperor.

348
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,800
I only know Ayu is inside.

349
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,560
Yes. Ayu isn’t a demon.

350
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,750
She’s innocent.

351
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,720
It’s the best time to kill the demon.

352
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,720
If we miss it,

353
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,480
Blood Devil will harm the world again.

354
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,480
Whoever is sacrificed at the moment,

355
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,870
Ziyang will not stop it.

356
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,390
If it won’t be stopped,

357
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,870
I will break it and get her out.

358
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,560
Your Highness.

359
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,200
Xue Qianxun, please help Dragon King.

360
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,440
You’re the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

361
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,720
You must know how to break the barriers.

362
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,320
Ayu shouldn’t be killed
for slaying the demon.

363
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,390
These barriers

364
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,440
were made by 81 Heavenly Soldiers.

365
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,960
I can’t break them either.

366
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,150
If mortals are killed,

367
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,480
the Heaven will compensate
with blessings.

368
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,870
But...

369
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
But what?

370
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,960
Ayu’s soul is different from mortals.

371
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,030
It’ll burn with the demon.

372
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,910
The barriers can’t be broken,

373
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,750
but we can try other ways.

374
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,150
How to put out fire?

375
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,840
By water?

376
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,110
Can we make a rain?

377
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Or find a cover

378
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,390
to shield the fire?

379
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,600
(Fire King)

380
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
(Fire King)
Dragon King?

381
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,560
What brings you to my Flame Palace?

382
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,510
Lend me the fire shield.

383
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,720
Yuchi Longyan. The fire shield

384
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,390
is the treasure of my palace.

385
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,960
It’s not something you can borrow.

386
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,630
How dare you! Guards, stop him!

387
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,800
Yuchi Longyan.

388
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,270
I’m slaying the demon,

389
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,680
while you’re breaking the barriers.

390
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,360
Are you going against me?

391
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,150
My Lord. Please help Dragon King.

392
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,150
Stay out of it.

393
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,390
Yuchi Longyan. Stop it!

394
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
Immortal Ziyang, you misunderstood him.

395
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,750
Xue Qianxun, why are you stopping me?

396
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,230
He just wants to save the mortal

397
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
in the cave.

398
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,270
I didn’t see any mortal there.

399
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,270
Don’t be cheated by dragon demons.

400
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,630
You liar!

401
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,630
Are you blind?

402
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,960
Ayu is inside.

403
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,270
You said I’m a demon.

404
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,440
You are ugly.

405
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,030
I’m cursing you back!

406
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,200
Don’t you trust me?

407
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,630
Even if a mortal is killed there,

408
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,800
they’ll be compensated with blessings.

409
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,200
My mission can’t be interrupted.

410
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,990
Your Highness.

411
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,200
You... Since you want a fight,

412
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,800
why did you attack him from the back?

413
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,680
Stay out of it. Be quiet.

414
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,840
Blood Devil has been slain.

415
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,560
You can go back and report now.

416
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,630
Let go of him for my sake.

417
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,110
Okay. For your sake.

418
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Blood Devil has been slain.

419
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,480
Go back and report
to Heavenly Emperor with me.

420
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,200
Ayu.

421
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,030
Ayu. Ayu.

422
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,150
Ayu. Take a breath.

423
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,720
Your Highness. What to do?

424
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,720
Ayu. Great!

425
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:17,990
Ayu.

426
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,560
Let me go.

427
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,680
Ayu.

428
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,990
Let go of me.

429
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,110
You are my maid.

430
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,910
How dare you be so rude to me?

431
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,910
Go back to my pavilion with me now.

432
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,360
Sorry. Sorry.

433
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,200
I... I didn’t mean to offend you.

434
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,320
I was in a hurry.

435
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,910
I was worried about her.

436
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,870
Please pardon this stupid bird.

437
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,080
You are really a stupid bird.

438
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
Yuchi Longyan didn’t want you to go
as well.

439
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,990
That makes sense.

440
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,990
My Lord, you are cold,

441
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,750
but you do understand him.

442
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,480
Don’t be afraid.

443
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,150
I’ll protect you afterwards.
