Don’t be afraid.

I’ll protect you afterwards.

19
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,470
Am I dead?

20
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,520
Silly girl. You’re still alive.

21
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,470
Who are you?

22
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,400
I’m Qingqing’s brother,

23
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,120
Long Yuchi.

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,800
Yuchi.

25
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,240
You’re wounded.

26
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Have some more sleep.

27
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,710
Yuchi…

28
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,350
My Lord,

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
no matter how wonderful
this world is,

30
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,270
your Luofeng Pavilion
is the best place.

31
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,240
It’s so complicated here

32
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,910
with many bad places,

33
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,400
and my place is the worst.

34
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,270
And I have nothing

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,800
to entertain you in my place.

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,240
My Lord, please go back.

37
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
It’s OK.

38
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,990
A pot of tea is enough.

39
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,520
My Lord! You…

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,270
Big surprise today!

41
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,120
As long as you can

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,620
finish my ten cakes

43
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,150
with the time of a cup of tea…

44
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Osmanthus House!

45
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,600
You can take them home for free.

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,990
Miss, come and have a look.

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,600
We have pea cakes, kidney bean rolls,

48
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,240
sugar steamed cakes, lotus cakes,
chrysanthemum cakes,

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
crabapple cakes, green bean cakes,
soybean cakes,

50
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,120
rose cakes and glutinous rice rolls.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Anything you want.

52
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,310
Then, I’ll help myself.

53
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,750
Miss, let me tell you

54
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,030
the rule first.

55
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,910
If you can finish the ten cakes

56
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,120
within the time

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
of a cup of tea,

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,440
they will all be free.

59
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,630
You don’t need to pay.

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,120
But if you can’t finish them,

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
it’s OK, you just need to pay for
what you eat.

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
Is it a good deal?

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,350
It’s not a surprise at all.

64
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,800
You just trick her to buy your cakes.

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,190
If I can’t finish them, I’ll just write
my name,

66
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,470
Long Qingqing, backwards.

67
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Good for you!

68
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,350
Long Qingqing?

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,910
Why is your surname Long?

70
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,840
Say it!

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,630
It was Yuchi Longyan who sent me

72
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,470
to Yuchi Town.

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,120
They asked my name,

74
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,190
so I told them I was surnamed Long.

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Don’t waste my time. It’s almost up.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
You’re my maid.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why didn’t you say your surname is Xue?

78
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,280
I…

79
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,870
Stop! Time is up!

80
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,750
Miss,

81
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,910
you need to pay for the nine cakes.

82
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,070
I can give you a discount.

83
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,350
180 pennies.

84
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,400
180 pennies?

85
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,120
That’s too much!

86
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,630
Isn’t it a good deal?

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,280
You wasted my time.

88
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,520
I have no money.

89
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,870
My Lord.

90
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,440
My Lord?

91
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,070
Miss, seems that today

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,470
you need to write your name

93
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,000
Long Qingqing backwards.

94
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,030
Ask the one surnamed Long
to pay for you.

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,400
No! No! My Lord!

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,280
You can’t leave! Are you a deadbeat?

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,560
You know what? My shop has been here
for a hundred years.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,870
There has never been a repudiation.

99
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,350
You want to dine and dash?

100
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
Silver?

101
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,120
This sir is so generous!

102
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,840
So handsome!

103
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,590
From now on, I’m Xue Qingqing!

104
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,150
This one, this one, and those.

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,440
Pack them up! Keep the change.

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,630
Thank you, Miss.

107
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,310
Xue Qingqing,

108
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,310
can’t you notice that the cup is empty?

109
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,350
My Lord, can you

110
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,800
not call my full name?

111
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,560
It sounds weird.

112
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,870
It’s not weird to be surnamed Long,

113
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,240
but it’s weird to use my surname?

114
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,840
No…

115
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,280
Then, is Bingxing also surnamed Xue?

116
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,560
Of course not!

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,470
How could everyone take my surname?

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Then…

119
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,440
Why should I take your surname?

120
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,350
My Lord, I’m sorry!

121
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,030
I didn’t do it on purpose! My bad!

122
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
-Let me help you…
-Xue Qingqing!

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
My Lord, don’t worry!

124
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,440
I’ll clean your clothes.

125
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,440
-Please don’t be angry.
-Xue Qingqing!

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,960
It’s a silk garment woven by
ten thousand snow silkworms.

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,070
How should I punish you?

128
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,800
Again?

129
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,070
Sorry, I forgot that you said

130
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
I couldn’t wipe two places with
the same rag.

131
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,030
I will write this line for 50 times.

132
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,800
But please don’t take me back to
Luofeng Pavilion.

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,320
If you take me back there, you will…

134
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,030
You will see me every day.

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,390
That means

136
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,830
I’ll always make you troubles.

137
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,680
You just don’t want to go back?

138
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
Since you don’t want to serve me,

139
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,080
go to Ayu now.

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,390
Really?

141
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,880
My Lord! That’s so nice of you!

142
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,880
No one can be sweeter

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
than you!

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,950
Then, I’m going.

145
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,240
Don’t come back if you want to go.

146
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,800
Who are you talking about?

147
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,880
Why is Qingqing running so fast?
Where is she going?

148
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,800
None of your business.

149
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,910
And, remember,

150
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,470
she is now Xue Qingqing,
not Long Qingqing.

151
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
I’m OK with it.

152
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,270
Thank you for your help

153
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,000
on the mountain.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
Don’t bother.

155
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
I just thought Qingqing’s crying
was annoying.

156
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,710
So I did her a favor.

157
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,390
Qingqing?

158
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,350
You do care about her.

159
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,470
Nonsense.

160
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,030
“Don’t come back if you want to go.”

161
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,910
It’s said to Qingqing, right?

162
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,080
What?

163
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,270
You must be upset

164
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
to see me instead of her.

165
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,470
You came to my home and said
you were just passing by.

166
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,440
But you did that so many times.

167
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,560
You say you don’t like her crying

168
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,240
and you gave her your last name.

169
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,200
You just like her.

170
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,800
I like Qingqing?

171
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,270
Impossible.

172
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,710
That’s duplicity.

173
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,800
The more you say it’s impossible,
the more it’s possible.

174
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
You must like Qingqing a lot.

175
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,150
You still run around

176
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,760
with internal injuries.

177
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,640
So brave.

178
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
I don’t have internal injuries.

179
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,470
Really?

180
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
I can cure myself.

181
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,390
I don’t need your help.

182
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,680
Now we are connected by power.

183
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,760
If you remove your hand now,

184
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,910
both of us will be hurt.

185
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,800
Now you’re too weak

186
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,560
to protect your beloved

187
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,470
who is always in trouble.

188
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,440
Don’t move!

189
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,950
Yes, right. Don’t move.

190
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,240
I just came back for the cakes.

191
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,150
I’ll leave right away.

192
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,470
Don’t worry.

193
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,120
I don’t see anything

194
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,470
and I won’t say anything.

195
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,910
You can keep on.

196
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,440
You can’t remove your hands while
transferring energy.

197
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,760
Yuchi.

198
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,000
Yuchi.

199
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,470
Ayu, you’re awake!

200
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,510
Do you feel better now?

201
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,560
Yes, I’m fine now.

202
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,510
Qingqing,

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,150
how long have I slept?

204
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,760
I remember that

205
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,350
after I went to see the little wolf,

206
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
I had a dream,

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,390
in which you had a brother.

208
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,390
It’s not a dream. I do have a brother.

209
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,710
He just came back from a long trip.

210
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,640
Is he Yuchi?

211
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,440
What? You call him Yuchi?

212
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,350
He told you his name is Yuchi?

213
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,640
Yes, he told me.

214
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,150
I guess he was also born in Yuchi Town.

215
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,640
That’s why he has this name.

216
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,240
When I was a kid,

217
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,030
my father wanted to name me Yu.

218
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Yes, right.

219
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,390
He was also born in Yuchi Town.

220
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,200
What a destiny.

221
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,000
Dragon King is so smart.

222
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,590
Liuying only called him Dragon King.

223
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,680
Now Ayu can call him Yuchi.

224
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,120
Qingqing,

225
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,510
how did I come back?

226
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,830
You went to the Hunter Cave
with Zhiyong to see the little wolf

227
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,120
and then the cave caught fire.

228
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,200
Luckily my brother passed by and
helped you out.

229
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
It was Yuchi who saved me?

230
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,760
Then…

231
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,880
What about Zhiyong?

232
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,760
Zhiyong…

233
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,440
He is dead.

234
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,270
Ayu,

235
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,760
the fire was too big.

236
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,640
When my brother got you out,

237
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,800
Zhiyong was already dying.

238
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,710
Now you are still weak.

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,240
You need more rest.

240
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,390
We can talk about

241
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,440
the other things later.

242
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,380
(Tomb of Zhiyong)

243
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,460
(Tomb of Zhiyong)

244
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,390
Yuxiang.

245
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,560
What’s wrong?

246
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,470
Bad news!

247
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,440
What bad news?

248
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,910
Big bad news! Zhiyong died!

249
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,390
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,200
I’ll beat you if you keep
talking nonsense.

251
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,080
It’s true!

252
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,560
There was a fire
in Hunter Cave yesterday,

253
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,710
and Zhiyong was in there.

254
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,000
Why did

255
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,560
Zhiyong go to Hunter Cave?

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,800
I heard that he went with Ayu to see

257
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,200
the little wolf which was just caught.

258
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,560
Then the cave suddenly caught fire.

259
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,760
Everything was burnt away

260
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
but Ayu is safe and sound.

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,590
What a jinx!

262
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,510
She got her mom dead

263
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,830
and now she got Zhiyong dead as well!

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Yuxiang…

265
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,200
Zhiyong died.

266
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,390
What’s the point for me of living alone?

267
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,800
What should I do?

268
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,440
Don’t be sad.

269
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,030
I can make a lot of

270
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
delicious food for you.

271
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,000
Ayu is such a hoodoo.

272
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,760
She murdered Zhiyong.

273
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,270
I have to revenge Zhiyong.

274
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,560
Is this going to be a dragon?

275
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,600
Don’t be afraid.

276
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,200
I’ll protect you afterwards.

277
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,510
Is that a dream

278
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,360
or reality?

279
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,750
Yuchi…

280
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,200
Silly girl.

281
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,750
Of course it’s true.

282
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
What?

283
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,150
I feel like

284
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,990
I heard Yuchi’s voice.

285
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,990
You still recognize me.

286
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,600
Come and have a look! Fresh fish!

287
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,110
They are just caught today!

288
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,320
Let me see.

289
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,990
-How much is it?
-Only one tael and three pennies.

290
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,870
-It looks good.
-They are fresh. Have a look.

291
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,230
You evil girl!

292
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,030
You burnt Zhiyong to death.

293
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,480
And now you came to the market.

294
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,560
Are you going to murder someone?

295
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,360
And you daredevils!

296
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,990
You even dare to buy her fish!

297
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,080
Who are you talking about?

298
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,960
You!

299
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,720
OK, if I’m an evil girl,

300
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,440
I will burn you
with my evil fire tonight!

301
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,990
If you are still alive tomorrow,

302
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,510
that means I’m not an evil girl.

303
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,560
Don’t be unreasonable.

304
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,680
I’d like to see

305
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,720
who dare to buy your fish today.

306
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,720
Really?

307
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,110
All fish are on sale today!

308
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,440
Only one penny for each!

309
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,750
Really? Only one penny?

310
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,870
I want this one!

311
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,870
OK.

312
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,720
Line up, please!

313
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,720
This one. This one is good.

314
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,870
So ignorant!

315
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,150
You came to my home and said
you were just passing by.

316
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,030
But you did that so many times.

317
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
You say you don’t like her crying

318
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,510
and you gave her your last name.

319
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,390
You just like her.

320
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,630
How does it feel to like someone?

321
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,440
How come Lord of Luofeng Pavilion
has time today?

322
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,390
Have some tea?

323
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,270
No, thanks.

324
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,910
Immortal, I want to ask you

325
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,270
how it feels to…

326
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,680
You promised to look up my

327
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
punishment for me last time.
Any information?

328
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,870
It’s pretty weird.

329
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,910
I’ve looked through all the records

330
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,230
but still found nothing.

331
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,030
Then…

332
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,990
What else can I do for you?

333
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
Immortal,

334
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,600
I’m curious.

335
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,800
You’ve made so many fates.

336
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,150
Then…

337
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,270
How does a man know

338
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,150
which woman he likes?

339
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,150
Well…

340
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,270
In fact, very few people

341
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,510
don’t know who they like.

342
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,840
What if there is such a case?

343
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,150
Actually, love is a simple thing.

344
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,960
You just need to take actions
to woo the one you love.

345
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,800
If you’re not tired of it

346
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,200
and it’s even happier than

347
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,320
being an immortal after you get her,

348
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,230
then you must love her.

349
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,080
That’s the feelings of love?

350
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,290
Steamed buns!

351
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,760
Fried bread stick!

352
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,460
Cakes!

353
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,240
Steamed buns!

354
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,270
Woo her?

355
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,840
Then it must mean to give her presents.

356
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,720
What presents should I give her?

357
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,840
This one is pretty.

358
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,990
Then, let’s buy this one.

359
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,990
OK.

360
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,030
Thank you!

361
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,910
Do you like it?

362
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,230
It’s so cute!

363
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,870
Sachet! Sachet!

364
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,390
Sir, my sachets are the best.

365
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,110
Here is the new
Dragon Boat Festival sachet

366
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,600
with great embroidery. You can use it
yourself or give it out as a gift.

367
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,230
Pack it up.

368
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
OK!

369
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,390
Thank you, sir!

370
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,990
Here you are.

371
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,600
Welcome again!

372
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,510
Sachet! Sachet!

373
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,630
Dragon Boat Festival sachet!
Ward off evil spirits!

374
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,200
Bird demon, cat demon, fox demon,

375
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,750
all will be driven away!

376
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,600
Miss, have a look!

377
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,420
(Blessing)

378
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,110
Ward off evil spirits?

379
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,030
We…

380
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,750
Demons are not all evil.

381
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,510
What’s more,

382
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,480
bird demon is not like fox demon.

383
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,680
I don’t want it.

384
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,080
I don’t care what way you use,

385
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,320
you have to find a way

386
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,680
to deal with Ayu.

387
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,200
Just leave it to me.

388
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,960
Don’t be too angry.

389
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,960
It’s not good for your health.

390
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,630
Only you’re willing

391
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,390
to help me since childhood.

392
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,390
Yuxiang,

393
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,320
your business is my business.

394
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,800
As long as you ask,

395
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,910
I will always…

396
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,680
Help you at all cost.

397
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,680
What brings you here?

398
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,150
You know what?

399
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,510
I can’t go back with you now.

400
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,630
I need to accompany Ayu.

401
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,720
Luofeng Pavilion doesn’t need you
for now.

402
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,600
Take this.

403
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,320
What’s it?

404
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,200
Food? Or something to use?

405
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,110
Cosmetics?

406
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,910
What day is it today?

407
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,480
You even give me a gift!

408
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,720
It’s not a gift.

409
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,960
It seems to suit you.
So I bought it by the way.

410
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,800
As expected,

411
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,510
she is so surprised just like those

412
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,480
women by the stall.

413
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,480
Dragon Boat Festival sachet!
Ward off evil spirits!

414
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,200
Bird demon, cat demon, fox demon,

415
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,720
all will be driven away!

416
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,110
You do this on purpose?

417
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,360
What do you mean?

418
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,510
Yes, I’m an evil demon

419
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,680
and you’re a noble immortal!

420
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,720
Thank you, My Lord.

421
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,560
It’s so rare for you

422
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,510
to give me such a nice gift.

423
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,800
On such a special day,

424
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,560
how about having a drink to celebrate?

425
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,230
Osmanthus wine.

426
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,720
One pot for each of us.

427
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,080
Let’s see who’ll get drunk first.

428
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,510
My Lord, you first.

429
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,750
My Lord, you’re always so nice to me.

430
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,720
I’ll drink it up first to show respect.

431
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,390
I don’t believe that I can lose
with osmanthus water.

432
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,390
Good drinker! One more!

433
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,910
Cheers!

434
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,510
My Lord, have another cup.

435
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,200
What a good drinker! Come on!

436
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,990
Cheers!

437
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,960
You can make replications?

438
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,080
My Lord, don’t you remember?

439
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
My power is sealed. I can’t.

440
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,150
But I can hold grudges.

441
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,390
Dislike me because I’m a demon?

442
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,480
Let’s see how I help you to ward off
evil spirits.

443
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Finished!

444
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,560
What are you laughing at?

445
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,320
Nothing.

446
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,840
I’m just happy.

447
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,630
I’m happy, too.

448
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,510
Let’s go to watch Dragon Boats Racing.

449
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,800
Now?

450
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,390
Let’s me clean these up first.

451
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
He’ll be laughed at if he goes out
like this.

452
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,200
Then I won’t be his maid anymore.

453
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,270
I’ll just go to the line and wait
for my reincarnation.

454
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,680
What are you waiting for?

455
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,320
Don’t waste time. Let’s go.

456
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,270
Wait! Wait.

457
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,270
Are you really going now?

458
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,320
Let me find you a hat.

459
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,990
Or an umbrella.

460
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,680
The sun is too hot.

461
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,840
This is the symbol of Bird King.

462
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,480
You’re the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

463
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,030
This exalted status befits yours.

464
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,510
Sorry! My bad! I’m wrong!

465
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,960
I don’t dare to do it again. I…

466
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,360
Sorry!

467
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,910
You think

468
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,150
I’ll beat you just for this?

469
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,560
I’m this mean

470
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,110
in your mind?

471
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,200
Of course not!

472
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,630
Look at me.

473
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,600
I’m being childish again.

474
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,960
You’re the generous
Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

475
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,270
You’ll forgive me, right?

476
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,960
Now,

477
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,360
it’s my turn to draw.

478
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I thought you would let me go.

479
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,800
It turns out to be
an idiotic idea again.

480
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,080
Come on.

481
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,270
Narrow-minded Lord

482
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,320
will definitely make me ugly

483
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,870
and take me out to the street.

484
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,440
How will I keep my image

485
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,200
if anyone recognizes me?

486
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,680
Or, I should just ask him

487
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,510
to make it as ugly as he can

488
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,510
until I can’t even recognize myself.

489
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,270
My Lord, I think…

490
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,270
