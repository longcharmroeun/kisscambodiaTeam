17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,520
I’m the real Ayu.

18
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,670
She’s fake!

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,560
How could you say that?

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
How am I fake?

21
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,350
Dragon King, she’s fake.

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,670
I’m the real one.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,990
Yuchi, I’m the real one.

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,430
She’s fake.

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,520
I’m real!

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,160
She’s fake!

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,200
She’s fake!

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,960
-No!
-I’m real!

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,750
I’m real!

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
I’m real!

31
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,030
-Stop! Stop!
-I’m real…!

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,710
You both say you’re Ayu.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,840
Then, let me ask you.

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,520
Why can Ayu come to Dragon Pool?

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,630
Say it!

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,520
Or, don’t blame me for being rude.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,910
-It’s you?
-It’s you two?

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,800
Why did you pretend to be Ayu?

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,400
That’s what I should ask you!

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,320
Lately, Dragon King always drowns
his sorrows in wine.

41
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,350
The trouble should be ended
by the one that started it.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,240
No matter what we say,

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,550
it can’t value more than a word
from the girl he loves.

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,880
But, how to let Ayu tell him?

45
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,880
Star Halo!

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,070
Yuchi said

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,550
he liked to see it.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Little firefly,

49
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,320
bring Yuchi here. Hurry up.

50
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,600
It’s the daytime.

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,120
Can Yuchi see the firefly?

52
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,070
Will the Star Halo still be there
when he comes?

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,430
So what?

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Did your heart beat fast

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,710
when you touched my forehead?

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,470
Don’t talk nonsense.

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,760
Xue Qianxun!

58
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,160
How dare you!

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,880
I just hit this bug.

60
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,120
Then let me hit the bug for you.

61
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,270
Seriously? Can you be reasonable?

62
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,190
Why should I?

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,830
Guys.

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,910
Guys!

65
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,160
It’s not a bug. It’s a firefly.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
Ayu is in trouble!

67
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,470
Ayu.

68
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,520
Yuchi! Finally you’re here!

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
What happened?

70
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,630
You… What happened to your clothes?

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,070
A small accident.

72
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,070
Are you alright?

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,870
I’m fine.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,630
What about you? What happened?

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,280
Look!

76
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,590
I remember you said

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,800
Star Halo is the thing you want to
see the most.

78
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,910
So beautiful.

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,870
Yuchi.

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
I cherish these

81
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,840
precious fireflies a lot.

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,240
But the Star Halo is so rare
and beautiful.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
So, I called you here

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,000
to enjoy it together.

85
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,680
There are many fireflies.

86
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,840
As long as you like,
you can use it anytime.

87
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,190
Really?

88
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,030
Then

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
I can see Yuchi anytime I want.

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,630
Sugar-roasted chestnuts!

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,870
And they are peeled!

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,910
Let’s eat together.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
It tastes good.

94
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,960
Weird. Star Halo
only appears after rain.

95
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,000
But there was no rain.

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
Yuchi.

97
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,150
You can take off your clothes.

98
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,190
Take off my clothes?

99
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,680
We…

100
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,910
That’s not so appropriate.

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,070
There’s nobody else here.

102
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
It’s OK.

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,520
Right here?

104
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,520
No. No, we can’t.

105
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,280
We can’t do it even not here.

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
No?

107
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,000
Why not?

108
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,310
Your sleeve is torn.
Let me sew it for you.

109
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,440
I brought needle and thread.

110
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,470
I’m real!

111
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,150
She’s fake!

112
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,440
She’s fake!

113
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,440
Immortal of Fate and Xue Qianxun
should take the blame.

114
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,720
They made me look so embarrassed
in front of Ayu.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
It’s OK. I can do it myself.

116
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Yuchi, you think I can’t do it well?

117
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,400
I always help my father sew clothes.

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,240
Trust me.

119
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,280
No, thanks.

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,630

I have done this much!

153

I’m pretty talented!

154
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,080
The tea today is good.

155
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,120
It was boiled just right.

156
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,240
You…

157
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,680
My Lord,

158
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,350
don’t you have anything to work on
in Luofeng Pavilion?

159
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,320
You just always come and ask me
to make you tea.

160
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,390
Because my maid hasn’t returned.

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,390
You have so many people there.

162
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,800
Anyone can replace me.

163
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,350
I think Bingxing is better than me.

164
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,680
I decide

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,120
who is better.

166
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,910
Alright, I accept it.

167
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,800
My Lord, may I have a request?

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,200
Can you give me back my power?

169
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,560
With my power, I can get things done.

170
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,830
At least,

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
I can protect myself and Ayu.

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,590
If I meet an injustice again

173
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,950
on the road,

174
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,760
I can give a helping hand…

175
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,710
OK.

176
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,950
Wait.

177
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,150
What did you say?

178
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,760
OK?

179
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,200
Stand still.

180
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,150
Yes.

181
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,590
Turn around three times and
laugh three times.

182
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,030
Laugh happily.

183
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,000
Two.

184
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,150
Three.

185
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,200
My Lord, when you sealed my power,

186
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
you just clapped once.

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,950
Why did it need so many moves

188
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
when you unsealed it?

189
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,350
You tricked me again!

190
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,270
You didn’t want to give me back

191
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,800
my power at the beginning, did you?

192
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,590
Your power was already unsealed

193
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,390
when I patted you on your shoulder.

194
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,030
The moves after that

195
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,680
were just a test of

196
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,200
how much you want your power back.

197
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,120
Why do you keep changing
into your real body?

198
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,390
I also want to ask you.

199
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,590
I wanted to get an osmanthus cake
for the first time.

200
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,240
And for the second time, I wanted to
freeze…

201
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,200
Forget it.

202
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,120
But when I used my power,

203
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,680
I could only change into my real body.

204
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,950
Is it

205
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,470
because my power has been sealed
for a long time

206
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,800
and it lost efficiency?

207
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,150
The seal has been altered.

208
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,150
I can’t unseal it.

209
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,800
Then, I’ve been working for nothing?

210
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,150
Oh, no.

211
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,590
As a bird demon, without my power,

212
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,910
I’m done!

213
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,440
Who altered the seal?

214
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
It doesn’t matter who did it now.

215
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,350
What matters is

216
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,440
I can’t get my power back.

217
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,760
It’s all your blame!

218
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,440
It’s all your fault!

219
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,760
All this wouldn’t have happened

220
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,640
if you hadn’t sealed my power!

221
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,030
What are you doing?

222
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,120
Stand up!

223
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
I’m wrong!

224
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,320
Look at you!

225
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,000
I have given you so many chances!

226
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,350
But you just disappointed me

227
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,120
every time.

228
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,030
Good of you.

229
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,710
Can you give me another chance?

230
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,080
OK.

231
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,510
I don’t want to see her again.

232
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,470
Who?

233
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,200
You want Ayu…

234
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,510
to die?

235
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,390
I…

236
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,880
So what?

237
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,910
You don’t dare to do it or you can’t?

238
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
I dare.

239
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,440
And I can do it.

240
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,760
But, can you grant me a small request?

241
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,470
How dare you have a request?

242
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,350
Yes.

243
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,080
Yuxiang, it’s been so many years.

244
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,680
I have always been following you.

245
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,240
I think

246
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,910
you must know

247
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,830
my feelings for you.

248
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,350
I like you.

249
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,680
Can I kiss you?

250
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,080
In your dream!

251
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,200
I knew it!

252
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,870
I knew that the girl I like

253
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,840
is not easy to get.

254
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,360
Don’t worry! Your business is mine.

255
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,480
Just count on me!

256
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,480
I’m going!

257
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,990
I’m going?

258
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Go!

259
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,800
Sure.

260
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,360
Qingqing is not here?

261
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,320
Did you do anything to the seal

262
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,390
of Qingqing’s power?

263
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,270
I changed the time limit of it.

264
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Why?

265
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
I intended to unseal it.

266
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,030
But I failed.

267
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,750
It was sealed by me.
But you wanted to unseal it?

268
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,110
It should be me to do it.

269
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,600
How could I know you…

270
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,030
Forget it.

271
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Next time when we have a drink,

272
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,510
I’ll punish myself by three cups.

273
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,800
Don’t bother. Just tell me

274
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,440
why I can’t unseal it.

275
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,360
You tried?

276
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,390
Yes.

277
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,480
Oh, no!

278
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,870
What do you mean?

279
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,990
If anyone tries to

280
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
break the seal I altered,

281
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,360
everything will start all over again.

282
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,910
You mean

283
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,110
Qingqing will be sealed for another
99 years?

284
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,510
I think I forgot to

285
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,110
tell Ayu something.

286
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,600
See you.

287
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,440
Seriously?

288
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,360
Why don’t you try not to get together

289
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,870
with Liuying for another 100 years?

290
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,390
That’s different.

291
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,110
How about I protect Qingqing

292
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,080
for you for the next 99 years?

293
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,510
I knew you were up to something!

294
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,600
You took Qingqing away
from Luofeng Pavilion,

295
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,150
and then you altered the seal.

296
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,750
And you even let her live
together with you.

297
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,910
Now you want to protect her
for 99 years!

298
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,150
What are you jealous of?

299
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,990
You know I have only Liuying in my heart

300
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
and I have no feeling for Qingqing.

301
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,440
She and I just have one common goal,

302
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,800
to protect Liuying.

303
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,510
You only have Liuying in heart?

304
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,320
But now you also have Ayu.

305
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,990
You’re being so sensitive because
you can’t get Qingqing.

306
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,030
I can’t get her?
It’s impossible between you and Ayu.

307
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,750
Why impossible?

308
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,990
Ayu and I are getting on well.

309
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
Now she calls me all the time.

310
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,840
What about Qingqing?
She just wants to escape from you.

311
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,510
You need reflect on yourself.

312
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,150
She is my maid.
Where can she escape to?

313
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,560
She managed to escape
from Luofeng Pavilion.

314
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,720
What do you think?

315
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,720
She will always be mine

316
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,990
no matter where she goes.

317
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,990
Ridiculous!

318
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,560
She only thinks she’s your maid.

319
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,960
But after next life,

320
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Ayu will be my wife!

321
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,750
Dragon King…

322
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,990
You…

323
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,870
Go on. Go on.

324
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,390
I’ll go back to my room.

325
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,080
Go on.

326
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,080
What?

327
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
How about we help each other

328
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,960
to apply the ointment?

329
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,870
OK.

330
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,560
Why should I help you first?

331
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,440
You have the ointment in hand.
Hurry up.

332
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,990
The Dragon King is afraid of pain?

333
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,560
Alright, your turn now.

334
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Where are you going?

335
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Going back to my Dragon Pool

336
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
to take a bath, of course.

337
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,150
You haven’t helped me yet!

338
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,960
Why do I feel so dizzy suddenly?

339
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,560
Did I get a heat stroke during the day?

340
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,320
That’s weird.

341
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,910
Why do I always feel dizzy recently?

342
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,440
Let me out!

343
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,720
Take off your clothes.

344
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,720
My pool can cure wounds.

345
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,200
Shouldn’t you help me to apply
the ointment first?

346
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,270
Why don’t you go to Qingqing?

347
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,390
Isn’t she your maid?

348
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,870
That’s right.

349
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,910
You just don’t want to ruin

350
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,150
your image in her mind, do you?

351
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
Not like that.

352
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,960
Don’t deny.

353
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,480
Human’s love needs you to spend
more time together.

354
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,840
But I have wounds on my body.

355
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,600
That will scare Qingqing.

356
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,230
That’s true.

357
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,910
Girls are all timid.

358
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,440
But it’s something

359
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,480
you have to experience.

360
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,990
Trust me.

361
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,360
Qingqing is not timid at all.

362
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,440
She doesn’t care about what I say

363
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,800
to her every time.

364
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,750
She can only remember it when I

365
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,110
order her or threaten her.

366
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,800
Then, have you ever thought

367
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,630
not to get along with her with your
identity as Lord?

368
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,110
I’m not the Lord?

369
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,910
What do you mean?

370
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,630
You are really dull.

371
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,560
In front of our beloved,

372
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,360
we are not the Dragon King or Lord.

373
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,360
You should put these thoughts aside

374
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,960
and simply get along with her

375
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,870
equally in the way a man

376
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,200
treats a woman.

377
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,750
How could it be equal

378
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,200
between her and me?

379
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,870
You will understand it gradually.

380
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,680
I need to put on my clothes now.

381
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,030
I have the feelings

382
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,360
that Ayu will call me soon.

383
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,680
You cast the power

384
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,510
of Connection on Ayu?

385
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,360
I don’t need to use power.

386
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,200
Love makes the connection.

387
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,630
Just enjoy your bath.

388
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,680
What is this?

389
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,030
Baldhead?

390
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,360
Why do you tie me up?
Let me go!

391
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,320
How do you know it’s me?

392
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,510
I’ve watched your head

393
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,680
since childhood. Of course I know it.

394
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,360
Where are you taking me to?

395
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,320
No more questions. Just tell me

396
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,150
what it is!

397
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,110
It’s mine!

398
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,110
Cut the crap.

399
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,870
Now even you are mine.

400
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,150
You’ve been kidnapped by me!

401
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,390
Just tell me what it is!

402
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,960
It’s mine! Don’t touch it!

403
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,750
I touched it. I touched it.

404
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,510
I want to…

405
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,750
How dared you bite me!

406
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,750
Just have some sleep now.

407
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,630
Come on. Sleep.

408
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,510
Close your eyes. Sleep.

409
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,870
Didn’t you say you’d be called soon?

410
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,510
What are you waiting for?

411
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,630
Are my clothes too plain for me?

412
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,720
Becoming silly is also what we
have to experience?

413
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,270
What did you say?

414
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,440
Nothing.

415
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,150
I can’t deal with you?

416
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,990
Where is Ayu?

417
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,480
Did I allow you to leave?

418
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,390
Sorry!

419
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,440
Where did you plan to take Ayu to?

420
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,630
I… I… I…

421
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,510
Say it!

422
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,510
No! No! It’s not me! It’s Yuxiang!

423
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,200
No! It’s not! It’s not Yuxiang either!

424
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,440
I… I wanted to sell her to…

425
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,630
Yuchi?

426
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,150
Why are you here?

427
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,320
Everything is fine now.

428
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,560
Where is my firefly jar?

429
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,390
Here.

430
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,200
What about Baldhead?

431
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,030
I have already punished him for you.

432
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,230
Baldhead

433
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,110
is usually no match for me.

434
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,510
But I don’t know why

435
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,630
I’ve been a little weak recently.

436
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,230
Let’s see how I will punish him
next time I see him.

437
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,390
No more talking.

438
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,840
Go to sleep now.

439
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:45,910
Yuchi,

440
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,840
can you leave after I fall asleep?

441
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,870
Sure.
