00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,840
You think

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,070
I’ll beat you just for this?

19
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,560
I’m this mean

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,030
in your mind?

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,030
Of course not!

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Look at me.

23
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,560
I’m being childish again.

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,880
You’re the generous
Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

25
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,200
You’ll forgive me, right?

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,750
Now,

27
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,160
it’s my turn to draw.

28
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,160
I thought you would let me go.

29
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,710
It turns out to be
an idiotic idea again.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,910
Come on.

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,320
Narrow-minded Lord

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,400
will definitely make me ugly

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
and take me out to the street.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,470
How will I keep my image

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,320
if anyone recognizes me?

36
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,680
Or, I should just ask him

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,470
to make it as ugly as he can

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,520
until I can’t even recognize myself.

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,160
My Lord, I think…

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,120
Shut up.

41
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,550
Done.

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,350
Open your eyes.

43
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,590
Time to watch the dragon boat racing.

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Have a look.

45
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,010
Sachet.

46
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,550
Sachet, pendant.

47
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,610
Mother, I want a cake.

48
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,560
Mother.

49
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,840
Okay.

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
Ayu,

51
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,030
you are selling flowers instead of fish.

52
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,310
Baldhead,

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,800
will you buy some flowers

54
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
for Yuxiang?

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,590
Young Master Zhiyong died.

56
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,470
You can take this chance to get her.

57
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,960
Am I that bad?

58
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
Zhiyong died not long ago.

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,350
You ask me to do this?

60
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,190
If I buy flowers,

61
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,310
I should send them to Zhiyong’s grave.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,030
Go away. No flower for you.

63
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,630
Then you can’t sell them to others.
Move.

64
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,000
-Stop.
-Ruin them.

65
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,680
Don’t!

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,910
-Raining flowers.
-Stop.

67
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,750
What are you doing?

68
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,150
-I’ll ruin all of them.
-Come on.

69
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,150
Stop doing it!

70
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,720
You can sell nothing.

71
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,470
What were you doing?

72
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,030
Caterpillars you’re most afraid of.

73
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,720
Caterpillars…

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Baldhead.

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,310
Longhair, come to help me.

76
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,350
Okay.

77
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,280
I can’t take them out.

78
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,630
-Baldhead.
-Scratch my legs.

79
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,750
-Take off your pants.
-My legs are itching, too.

80
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
Take off my pants in public?

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,630
Well...

82
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,470
Make a way out. Stop fooling me.

83
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,870
Here, beat him with this.

84
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Okay.

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,440
Why beat me?

86
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,680
I’m beating the caterpillars.

87
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,280
Do you feel better?

88
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,070
Yes.

89
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,840
Good.

90
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,680
Come on.

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
You’ll pay for this!

92
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,750
Be gentle!

93
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,070
Well, don’t run.

94
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,400
Here, here.

95
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,350
Be gentle!

96
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,150
I’ll buy all of these flowers.

97
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,240
They’re not worth so much.

98
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,680
I know you!

99
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,680
You know me?

100
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,350
You know I am...

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,470
You’re Yuchi who saved me.

102
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,720
It must be you!

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
Although I didn’t see you clearly,

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,190
I won’t make it wrong.

105
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,750
These flowers are ruined.

106
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,400
I can’t take your money.

107
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,800
If you want flowers,

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
I’ll bring you some fresh ones.

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,470
It doesn’t matter.

110
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,720
Ayu,

111
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,280
can I take you to a place?

112
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,720
Where?

113
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,150
You’ll know it.

114
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,120
Okay.

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
I haven’t been here for a long time.

116
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,870
It hasn’t changed at all.

117
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,120
Yuchi, look.

118
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,190
Fireworks.

119
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,560

150
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,910
I just recall that Zhiyong and I

151
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,510
came here to watch the stars

152
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,800
and we inscribed characters on the wall.

153
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,950
I’ll find them.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,560

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,470
I don’t know

158
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,510
what we were thinking then.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
This city wall was built by the court.

160
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,510
He shouldn’t have
inscribed characters with you.

161
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,710
It’s damage to public property.

162
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,030
We were young then.

163
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,470
A man and a woman
shouldn’t stay together alone.

164
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,760
From now on,
you can only come here with me.

165
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,590
But you’re a man, too.

166
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,200

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,880

168
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,950
It’s cold here.

169
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,760
Don’t stay for long.

170
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,910
“It’s cold here. Don’t stay for long.”

171
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,350
I heard this somewhere else.

172
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,150
It’s cold here.

173
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,390
Don’t stay for long.

174
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,150
What’s wrong?

175
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Nothing.

176
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,640

179
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
Yuchi,

180
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,560
this way is not to your home.

181
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,830
I...

182
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,200
I’ll send you home.

183
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
What if that Baldhead
makes trouble for you again?

184
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,120
I’m not afraid of him.

185
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,440
Moreover,
you can’t protect me at all time.

186
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,910
And I’m not so fragile.

187
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,390
This is for you.

188
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
What’s this? So beautiful.

189
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,510
These are fireflies I trained.

190
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,080
Fireflies can be trained?

191
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,760
Once you release one firefly out,

192
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,150
it will come to me

193
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,800
and lead me to you.

194
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,590
Then,

195
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,270
I can see you at any time.

196
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,150
Yes, any time.

197
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,680
Thank you, Yuchi.

198
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,680
Remember to release the firefly.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,240
What’s wrong with me?

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,150
I can’t fall sleep and keep missing him.

201
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,680
What am I thinking?

202
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,080
I haven’t finished the embroidery
on the handkerchief.

203
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,080
Is a scholar too gentle?

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,910
It’s not good

205
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,910
if there is a fight.

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,800
No.

207
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,080
I shouldn’t tackle the hooligans
with this,

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,950
or I’ll be laughed at.

209
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,880
This suit is good.

210
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,560
Where is Qingqing?

211
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,560
When did you come?

212
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,830
When you wore the armor.

213
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,680
What are you doing this for?

214
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,350
I’m waiting for Ayu’s calling.

215
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,710
Calling?

216
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,640
Once Ayu releases a firefly to call me,

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
I’ll be right there by her side.

218
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,510
But dressing is not that important.

219
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,240
What do you mean?

220
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,350
Women love gifts the most.

221
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,710
If she wants to see you,

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,440
will you meet her with nothing?

223
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
You’re right.

224
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,000
You haven’t told me where Qingqing is.

225
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,510
What about flowers?

226
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,200
Ayu is a florist.

227
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,590
You send her flowers?

228
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,590
What’s this?

229
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,710
The Empress’s phoenix hairpin.

230
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,590
It’s delicate and unique.

231
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,030
It’s the Empress’s?

232
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,080
You want Ayu to be killed?

233
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,080
You want her to ride it in a war?

234
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,830
These silk fabrics are too pompous.

235
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,270
The Night Pearl is too precious.

236
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,630
You send her this to
scrape the scales of fish?

237
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,320
I see.

238
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,440
You’re jealous of me.

239
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,680
So you disagree with me

240
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,720
for whatever I do.

241
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,110
Why should I be jealous of you?

242
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,720
I’m much closer to Ayu.

243
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,840
While you and Qingqing are still

244
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,080
playing hide and seek.

245
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,030
Much closer?

246
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,840
Qingqing follows my family name now,

247
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,230
while Ayu

248
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,600
hasn’t called you till now.

249
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,960
I can go to meet her.

250
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,680
You keep it.

251
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,320
-Stop!
-Miss Yuxiang...

252
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,800
Listen to me,

253
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
yesterday, Longhair and I

254
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,080
made great damage to

255
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,840
Ayu’s flower stall.

256
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
All the flowers were ruined,

257
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,800
and the petals were all over the ground.

258
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,560
It doesn’t matter you have no hair,

259
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,200
but can you think with your brain?

260
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,960
It’s not what I want.

261
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,750
Well...

262
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,110
It’s far from enough.

263
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,680
I see.

264
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,800
I will make a bigger trouble for her.

265
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,910
Leave it to me.

266
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,510
Don’t be too upset.

267
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,870
Qingqing,

268
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,560
why do you come to help me today?

269
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,560
It’s a fair day. I’ll give you a hand.

270
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,480
Help me cry my goods.

271
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,600
Okay.

272
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
Flowers!

273
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,150
Fresh flowers! Ayu’s flowers!

274
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,960
Anyone wants flowers?

275
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,990
-Fresh flowers.
-Fresh flowers.

276
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,510
-It’s good she didn’t call me.
-Fresh flowers.

277
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,200
It means she’s safe.

278
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,030
Flowers!

279
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,320
-Flowers! Fresh flowers!
-Chestnuts roasted with brown sugar!

280
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,800
-Ayu’s flower!
-Chestnuts roasted with brown sugar!

281
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,560
It tastes

282
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,270
like what I had in the capital.

283
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,080
Flowers!

284
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
-I’ll send you
-Fresh flowers!

285
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,080
chestnuts roasted with brown sugar.

286
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Ruan Ayu!

287
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,150
Ruan Ayu!

288
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,600
You profiteer!

289
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,030
I won’t forgive you.

290
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,870
Mrs. Sun, what’s the matter?

291
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,510
Mrs. Sun’s grandson Fuwang

292
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,270
ate the fish you sold

293
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
and got serious diarrhoea.

294
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,270
He’s so sick that

295
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,230
he nearly mistook me as Longhair.

296
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,320
How do you want to deal with it?

297
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,600
How to deal with it?

298
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Report to the government.

299
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,440
-Yes.
-Arrest her.

300
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,270
-That’s right.
-Come here, everyone.

301
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
This profiteer Ayu

302
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,910
-sold stale fish
-Come here, everyone.

303
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,870
-and made the buyers sick.
-Come have a look.

304
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,750
Come here, everyone.

305
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,600
-What nonsense! Nonsense!
-Come here.

306
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,750
You’re venomously slandering her.

307
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,510
Don’t worry.

308
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,840
My fish is fresh.

309
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,990
It’s nothing to worry.

310
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,990
That’s right.

311
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,870
Ayu,

312
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,910
Fuwang is so sick now.

313
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,110
Tell me, what should I do?

314
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,680
Mrs. Sun,

315
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,510
how exactly is Fuwang now?

316
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,270
We visited a physician.

317
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,230
The physician said,

318
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,560
it’s because he ate the soup

319
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,630
made by your stale fish.

320
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,480
How will you deal with it?

321
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,110
Everyone, what should we do now?

322
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,990
Report to the government.

323
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,910
Yes, report to the government.

324
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,360
Compensate money.
Report to the government.

325
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Don’t talk nonsense.

326
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
Call me.

327
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,320
Report to the government.

328
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,680
Ayu,

329
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,720
Fuwang ate your fish.

330
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,750
He not only has diarrhea,

331
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,320
but also a sore throat.

332
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Sore throat?

333
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,600
Is he slobbering?

334
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Yes, he keeps slobbering.

335
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,270
You profiteer Ayu.

336
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,030
Don’t talk endlessly here.

337
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,510
You should talk at the court.

338
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,440
Yes.

339
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,560
It’s a bawbee.
Why should we go to the court?

340
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,080
We can solve it by ourselves.

341
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,480
Bawbee?

342
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,200
How to solve it? With money?

343
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,600
Do you have money?

344
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
You!

345
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,080
Diarrhea, sore throat and slobbering.

346
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,630
Mrs. Sun, I can cure Fuwang.

347
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,750
Really?

348
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,630
Well, don’t boast.

349
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,080
Are you a physician?

350
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,750
Mrs. Sun, let’s not waste time,

351
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,510
or Fuwang will suffer more.

352
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,680
Okay. I’ll trust you for the last time.

353
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,870
-Let’s go now.
-Okay.

354
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,600
Miss Yuxiang, just ignore her.

355
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,030
Why didn’t she call me?

356
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,150
You must cure my grandson, Fuwang.

357
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,270
Mrs. Sun, don’t worry.

358
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,800
Let me check Fuwang first.

359
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,840
You do take yourself as a physician?

360
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,630
Yeah.

361
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,680
I said long ago,

362
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,630
it’s because Fuwang ate the soup
made by stale fish.

363
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,910
Ayu,

364
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,990
don’t delay the treatment of Fuwang.

365
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,510
Leave him to us, okay?

366
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,270
You can’t solve the problem by this.

367
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,720
Admit your fault,

368
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,510
admit you’re a profiteer,

369
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,750
report to the government by yourself,

370
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,800
and admit your fault,

371
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
okay? Am I right, everyone?

372
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Yes. Yes.

373
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
-Water is coming.
-That’s right!

374
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,800
It’s hot. Baldhead, have some water.

375
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,560
Physician Jia, have some.

376
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,390
-Yuxiang, do you want some?
-No.

377
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,150
No!

378
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
When I became a physician,
you were younger than Fuwang is now.

379
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,270
How dare you doubt my medical skill?

380
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,510
That’s right. Physician Jia

381
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,480
is well-known among the neighbors.

382
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,560
You’re playing sword before...

383
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,840
before...

384
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,200
Wait.

385
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,150
-Well, I have to go to the toilet.
-Give me.

386
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,360
Wait a moment. Give way.

387
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,440
Physician Jia,

388
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,680
as far as I know,
stale fish or shrimps

389
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,320
may lead to diarrhea and erythema.

390
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,870
Why there is no erythema

391
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,480
on Fuwang’s body?

392
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,910
What a joke! You know nothing.

393
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,320
The soup Fuwang ate contains nothing

394
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,680
except the fish and some ginger slices.

395
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,750
If it’s not the fish’s problem,

396
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,750
it’s the ginger slices’?

397
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,750
I’ll go to the toilet first.

398
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,110
Let’s talk later.

399
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,230
-Physician Jia, be quick.
-Physician Jia.

400
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,200
Physician Jia, be quick.

401
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,800
Ayu, Ayu, Ayu, Yu.

402
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,510
-I’m here.
-Ayu.

403
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,910
It’s...

404
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,230
the fish’s problem. It’s the fish.

405
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,990
Baldhead, why are you slobbering?

406
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,910
Am I?

407
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,390
I don’t know.

408
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,990
I... I have to go to the toilet again.

409
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,910
I’ll go again.

410
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,230
His... His symptoms

411
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
are similar to Fuwang’s.

412
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,800
With erythema or not,

413
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,720
it’s the fish’s problem, anyway.

414
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,080
Diarrhea, sore throat and slobbering.

415
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,680
-It’s obviously...
-It’s obviously...!

416
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,910
I’ll be back...

417
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,440
Physician Jia.

418
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,630
So weird!

419
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,110
They didn’t eat Ayu’s fish.

420
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,870
Why they have the same symptoms
as Fuwang?

421
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,440
Why?

422
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,680
Why?

423
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,950
They didn’t eat the fish soup.

424
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,170
It’s so strange.

425
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,720
Come on.

426
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,480
You please!

427
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,230
You please! Please!

428
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,630
Physician Jia.

429
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,080
Do you both have diarrhoea?

430
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,150
What diarrhoea?

431
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,600
Diarrhoea,

432
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,030
sore throat,

433
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,360
and slobbering.

434
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,230
It’s obviously being poisoned.

435
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,110
Tell me, did you

436
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,110
add croton seeds in our tea?

437
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,480
It’s because of croton seed?

438
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,270
Croton seed!

439
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,990
Croton seed?

440
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,230
It’s croton seed.

441
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
No, no.

442
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
No, listen to me.

443
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,960
It’s croton seed.

444
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
No, no, no.

445
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,390
You, no, you...

446
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,150
Physician Jia, your symptoms

447
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,390
are the same as Fuwang’s,

448
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,800
because you ate croton seed.

449
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,030
But you said Fuwang had diarrhea.

450
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,510
Don’t you delay his treatment?

451
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,960
Yes, that’s right. It’s a delay.

452
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,480
No, no, it’s not like this.

453
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,800
-No, no.
-Baldhead.

454
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,800
Your money.

455
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,560
No.

456
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,150
It’s you who made the trouble.
You solve it.

457
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
What? What money is this?

458
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,390
Baldhead,

459
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
why did he give you money?

460
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,960
I... I don’t know.

461
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,560
Mrs. Sun, obviously,

462
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,030
the truth is Baldhead and Yuxiang

463
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,320
colluded with Physician Jia

464
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,960
by money to frame Ayu.

465
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,870
I bet the croton seeds

466
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,720
were put by them, too.

467
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,840
-You mean me...
-It’s definitely you.

468
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,800
No, no, no.

469
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,390
It has nothing to do with me.

470
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
Who did it then?

471
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,440
I... don’t know.

472
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,480
Physician Jia.

473
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,320
His medical kit was left behind.

474
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,030
What a forgetful man!

475
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,750
I’ll send it to him.

476
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,840
You!

477
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,840
Ayu,

478
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,360
what... what should we do

479
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,560
about Fuwang?

480
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,200
Mrs. Sun, don’t worry.

481
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,480
I have some medicine made
of goldthread root and golden cypress.

482
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,720
It can detoxify the croton seed.

483
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,080
It’s so risky.

484
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,200
Here you are.

485
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,630
Thank you!

486
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,480
Ayu,

487
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,750
I’m so sorry that

488
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,960
I misunderstood you just now.

489
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,030
That’s all right.

490
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,720
Miss Ayu is so generous.

491
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,390
Yes. Ayu has both
a beautiful face and a beautiful heart.

492
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,320
Yes. What a good girl! She’s kind.

493
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
See? I told you,

494
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,960
the fish Ayu sells

495
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,440
has no problem at all.

496
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,110
Welcome to buy fish again.

497
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,630
Okay. Okay. I will. I will.

498
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,720
-Bye.
-It’s done.

499
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,150
Go back to your work.

500
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,680
Ayu.

501
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,320
How did you know
Fuwang ate croton seed?

502
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
I was piggish and had no mom.

503
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,080
I ate stale fish and
croton seed before.

504
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,390
My experience tells me the difference.

505
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,360
Qingqing,

506
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,360
when I was treating my wound,

507
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
how did you look after Ayu?

508
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,360
I didn’t do it intentionally.

509
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,840
I didn’t know human kids

510
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,510
can’t eat those.

511
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,600
Have a seat.

512
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
Qingqing, you have more experience.

513
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,630
Can you teach me

514
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,630
how to make lifelike embroidery?

515
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,080
What pattern do you like?

516
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,560
I’ll find a master for you.

517
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,680
I like dragon.

518
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,200
Dragon?

519
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,600
Dragon King, did you hear it?

520
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,750
Ayu has you in her mind now.

521
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,270
If I can complete the other half dragon

522
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,750
on Yuchi’s handkerchief,

523
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,320
he must be happy.

524
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,680
Qingqing, is this yours?

525
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,840
Why is it still here?

526
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,960
You people...

527
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,510
What does it mean if a man
sends a sachet to a woman?

528
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,320
Generally, it’s

529
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,480
love.

530
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,230
What’s wrong?

531
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,200
Nothing.

532
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,750
Impossible!

533
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,030
Stop pretending. It’s silly.

534
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,870
Why it’s you again?

535
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,840
Me again?

536
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,910
You must be disappointed
when seeing me.

537
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,080
Yes.

538
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,680
It seems you didn’t see her.

539
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,800
No, I saw her.

540
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,200
But she didn’t call you.

541
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,870
It means Ayu is safe and sound.

542
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,840
No.

543
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,440
She met some difficulties,

544
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,630
but she never thought

545
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,270
to call me from the very beginning.

546
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,750
So, the noble Dragon King

547
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,960
thinks he’s not needed.

548
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,150
What about you?

549
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,960
You’ve been waiting from dawn to night,

550
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,510
but she hasn’t come to you.

551
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
This is her home.

552
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,600
It’s late. She’ll be home soon.

553
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,030
It’s past 7:00 PM.

554
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,680
As her brother in the human world,

555
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,560
you don’t care about where she is?

556
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,390
When she was Long Qingqing,

557
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,990
I was her brother.

558
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,320
Now she’s Xue Qingqing.

559
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,720
I have nothing to do with her.

560
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,270
Where do you think she could go?

561
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,150
Is it possible she’s at Ayu’s home?

562
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,680
Will you go to find her?

563
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,600
No.

564
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
Then you keep waiting here.

565
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,510
Why didn’t you call me?

566
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,840
Where is your firefly jar?

567
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,960
Is it

568
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,480
you lost it?

569
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,680
Yuchi.

570
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,870
Why haven’t you called me?

571
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
Is it you lost the jar?

572
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,480
You must’ve lost the jar.

573
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,200
So you can’t call me.

574
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,320
Wine is really a good thing.

575
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,750
I have an illusion again.

576
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,600
It’s not an illusion.

577
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,270
I also have phonism?

578
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,230
You don’t have phonism.

579
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,320
You are really Ayu?

580
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,840
Who are you?

581
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,910
Who are you?!

582
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,320
I’m the real Ayu.

583
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,510
She’s fake!

584
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,440
How could you say that?

585
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,960
How am I fake?

586
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,030
Dragon King, she’s fake.

587
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,390
I’m the real one.

588
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,870
Yuchi, I’m the real one.

589
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,150
She’s fake.

590
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,230
I’m real!

591
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,030
She’s fake!

592
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,960
-She’s fake!
-No.

593
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,960
I’m real!
