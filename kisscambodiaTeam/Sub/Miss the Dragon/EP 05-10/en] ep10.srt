Let go of me! Let go of me!

Yuchi Longyan can touch you,

20
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,390
but I can’t?

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
I won’t run, all right?

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,070

with Yuchi Longyan?

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,800
We’re in no relationship!

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,120
We’re simply friends.

26
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,550
Good friends.

27
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,910
If you were simply friends,

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,830
why did he give you so many treasures?

29
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,400
Why does a bird like you need this?

30
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,990
He’s just generous.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,630
-It hurts!
-Generous?

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,190
Don’t I have these

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,350
in Luofeng Pavilion?

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,630
You’re my maid.

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
Your belongings

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,710
are mine.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,830
Tell Yuchi Longyan I appreciate
his generosity.

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,630
You villain!

39
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,240
Why did you take things for Liuying?

40
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,830
Oh.

41
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,070
Oh my!

42
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,240
What should I say to Longyan?

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,400
You’re so bold to come back here.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,910
The beautiful silk!

45
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,270
You tore them.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
The cakes.

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,070
You ate most of them.

48
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,520
The medical herbs!

49
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,880
That’s what’s left for her.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,350
They’re for Liuying?

51
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,870
Well, they’re not for me of course.

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,310
Cold-blooded man.

53
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,560
You’re exactly the reason

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,280
why she ends up like this.

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Dragon King bought these

56
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
for her to regain health.

57
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,440
Yet you intercepted them.

58
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,310
You’re so... so...

59
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,000
You’re rotten.

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,000
I’m no longer your maid.

61
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,400
Stop.

62
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,960
Wait.

63
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,190
Well,

64
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,240
there are a few osmanthus cakes left.

65
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Do you want them?

66
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,560
No!

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,520
I can turn a blind eye

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,750
to the mistakes you made.

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
Besides,

70
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,800
I grant you the floral makeup.

71
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
Are you serious?

72
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,310
Of course I am.

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,750
Then I’ll...

74
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,590
But you have ruined

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,280
most of these things.

76
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,870
What am I going to tell Dragon King
and Liuying?

77
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
You’ve never been so devoted

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,240
to the tasks I gave you.

79
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,910
As my maid,

80
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
you don’t need to follow his order
to look after...

81
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,560
Liuying is my friend.

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,000
I’m willing to.

83
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,240
And...

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,070
And I’m not your maid anymore.

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,960
It’s not been 100 years as we agreed.

86
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,030
So you’re still my maid.

87
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,000
How dare you say that?

88
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,120
You never saved my life,

89
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,680
or cured my wounds,

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,070
not to mention
bought me osmanthus cakes.

91
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,470
Dragon King bought it, not you.

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,150
These are not good at all.

93
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,560
The silk is hideous.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,280
One day, I’ll show you, my maid,

95
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,310
what real treasure is.

96
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,630
Really?

97
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,590
Well, I’m your maid

98
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,870
and you rarely talked so much.

99
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,190
So you must be thirsty.

100
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,310
Let me get you a cup of tea.

101
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,120
Show me the real treasure?

102
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,280
I’ll show you how to loose the bowels.

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,000
My Lord, your tea.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,350
I’ll be waiting...

105
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,840
for you to show me the real treasure.

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,030
Why did my mood

107
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,520
change so abruptly today?

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,740
Mrs. Xu.

109
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:13,790
Sir.

110
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,510
-Alright.
-I want this.

111
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
Sir, how much is this?

112
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,400
Like usual,

113
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,420
the same price of last time.

114
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,100
Thanks.

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,800
I’ll pack it up.

116
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,260
Here you go.

117
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,460
Alright, thank you.

118
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,880
This painting

119
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,240
looks so familiar.

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
The lady on it

121
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,950
resembles you a lot.

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
(Suxin Drawings)
Madam, you have a good eye.

123
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,910
This painting is found in the woods.

124
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
I framed it after it’s sold to me.

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
In the woods?

126
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,150
Madam, look at the lines.

127
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,470
Smooth flows and strong touch.

128
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,590
The dragon is vivid

129
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,710
and majestic in the clouds.

130
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,030
But from the lady’s eyes
in the painting,

131
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,830
you can see mildness.

132
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,000
It’s truly wonderful.

133
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,470
Madam.

134
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,950
Are you alright?

135
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,080
I’ll buy it.

136
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,510
Sure.

137
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,800

Dragon King, we’re running out of time.

Liuying.

198
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,950
Drink it.

199
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,880
Is it bitter?

focus on what I’m going to say,

203
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560

What is it you want to say?

264
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,870
Lord Yuchi,

265
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,230
you vowed to protect Xiahou Xue
for three tribulations in mortal world.

266
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,630
It’s just the first one

267
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,270
and you want to disavow.

268
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,720
There’s no precedent.

269
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,080
No exception. A rule is a rule.

270
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,440
If you tell me how to overrule it,

271
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,390
I will...

272
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,230
I will do one thing you ask, anything.

273
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,440
I don’t need you to do anything.

274
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,630
And I will not help you with this.

275
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,360
Bingxing, see our guest out.

276
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,720
Lord Yuchi, please.

277
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,360
Please tell me how to overrule it.

278
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,680
I told you.

279
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,230
There’s no point begging him.

280
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,870
Let’s go.

281
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,030
You stay here.

282
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,390
Me?

283
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,320
You’re a maid in Luofeng Pavilion.

284
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,390
Forget it.

285
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,910
You’re a cold-blooded man.

286
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,230
I don’t want to be your maid,
let alone a friend.

287
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,200
I’m going back

288
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
to my real friends.

289
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,630
Stop.

290
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,230
Leave us.

291
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,990
If you tell me how to overrule it,

292
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,560
I, Yuchi Longyan, will be in your debt.

293
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,510
The Dragon King never bowed his head.

294
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,510
Is it all for

295
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,080
Liuying?

296
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,510
Yes.

297
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,200
Is this your reverse scale?

298
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,840
Who is it

299
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,230
that hurt you so badly?

300
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,680
I’m fine.

301
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,630
It’s me.

302
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,030
It’s overwhelming pain

303
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,800
to claw a dragon’s reverse scale out.

304
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,110
Unbelievable, what did you do?

305
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,870
Claw out your reverse scale
and incarnate it

306
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,440
to Xiahou Xue’s destined man.

307
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,200
Perhaps, you will deceive the Heaven.

308
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,600
I broke the oath.

309
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,800
Merely for a mortal girl?

310
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,750
Are you still the Dragon King I knew?

311
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,230
Do me a favor.

312
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,270
Find Xiahou Xue’s destined man

313
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,360
who lacks a thread of soul

314
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,630
and put my scale on him.

315
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,440
I can’t help you.

316
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,910
You have to.

317
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,030
I won’t help you,

318
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,030
unless...

319
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,080
The Golden Armor.

320
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,200
You’re giving it to me?

321
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,800
Take it.

322
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,720
To survive the thunder strike,

323
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,800
you almost lost your life
to get the Armor.

324
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,800
I just want to remind you

325
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,750
don’t make a choice that you’ll regret.

326
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,560
I will not regret

327
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,910
the choice I made.

328
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,870
Just write the Book of Fate
for Xiahou Xue.

329
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,720
Do you think you can be with her

330
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,800
by sending your scale to Xiahou Xue?

331
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,510
Yes, I do.

332
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,080
My Lord.

333
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,390
My Lord.

334
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,510
My Lord.

335
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,990
I have some tasty osmanthus cakes

336
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,720

337
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,200

338
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,870

339
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,200
Get up.

340
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,510
Are you still angry with me?

341
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,680
I wasn’t serious about

342
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,600
no one loving you.

343
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,560
I’m here to apologize.

344
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,990
You can punish me or scold me,

345
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,320
but don’t send me

346
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,630
to the River of Tears and sing.

347
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,030
You’re sweating.

348
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,230
Blood.

349
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,230
Look who is finally back.

350
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,870
What’s wrong with him?

351
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,600
Thanks to your friend,

352
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,960
Lord is punished.

353
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,600
By Dragon King?

354
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,080
If Luofeng Pavilion is found impartial,

355
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,080
Lord will be punished with broken ribs.

356
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,030
He gave Dragon King an exception.

357
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,870
As a disciplined man,
he punished himself.

358
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,200
Broken ribs?

359
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,750
Take care of him.

360
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,390
My Lord.

361
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,080
I was wrong.

362
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,150
I take back what I said

363
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,910
about you.

364
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,800
You look cold and aloof,

365
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,440
but you’re not callous at all.

366
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,480
It’s me. I was wrong about you.

367
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,320
I was so blind.

368
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,230
You have to recover soon.

369
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,150
-When you do, I’ll...
-Shut up.

370
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,360
My Lord,

371
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,960
you’re awake.

372
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,600
That’s great.

373
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,480
Stay away.

374
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,870
No, I will not walk away anymore,

375
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,960
unless you promise you’ll not
be angry with me.

376
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,390
You’re pressing my wound.

377
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,510
Oh, sorry, My Lord.

378
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,750
I... I... I...

379
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,560
I’ll pour you a cup of tea.

380
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,110
My Lord, have some hot tea.

381
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,720
Hot tea helps you heal.

382
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,720
What is it?

383
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,510
Is there anything else in the tea?

384
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,990
No!

385
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,030
I’m sorry about the last time.

386
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,320
Look, I’ll take a sip first.

387
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,270
See? I’m absolutely fine.

388
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,480
I’ll get you another cup.

389
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
I drank from it.

390
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,270
My Lord,

391
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,990
thank you for letting Liuying loose.

392
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,270
The crack of sky net is still there.

393
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,320
I never said I’d let Liuying loose.

394
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,510
You’ll still patch it
with Liuying’s soul?

395
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,720
No way!

396
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,750
I need to tell Dragon King now.

397
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,600
Didn’t you say you’ll not walk away?

398
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,750
Even if the doppelganger can
deceive the Heaven,

399
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,630
you and her can’t get married.

400
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,600
Is that so?

401
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,960
All your sacrifices are in vain.

402
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,030
Why don’t you forget her?

403
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,230
Even if we can’t get married,

404
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,720
I’ll stay with her.

405
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,200
You will go to the mortal world?

406
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,230
Wherever she is,

407
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,030
I’ll be there.

408
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,840
She’s born. Liuying is back!

409
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,030
I miss her so much!

410
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,560
Hey, why would Liuying choose this place

411
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,390
to be born?

412
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,320
Yuchi Town.

413
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,030
What about it?

414
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,390
Yuchi.

415
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,870
Is it because this village has

416
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,030
the same name with you

417
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,510
that she chose to be born here?

418
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,990
One way or another,

419
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,800
Liuying chose me in the end.

420
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,480
