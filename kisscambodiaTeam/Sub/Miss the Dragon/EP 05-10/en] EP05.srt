16

=Episode 5=

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,710
Well, when we

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,390
met you in the garden,

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,200
was it just after a thunder strike?

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,750
It must hurt a lot.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,350
Yes.

22
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,750
It hurt a lot.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,710
It pains here

24
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,670
and here too.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,560
So at a moment like this,

26
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,470
she doesn’t care about that men and
women shouldn’t have direct contact.

27
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,240
What’s that sound?

28
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Why is your heart pumping so fast?

29
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,880
In dramas,

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,190
this is love.

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,120
Dramas are not always right.

32
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,990
Is your heart racing?

33
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Dumpling.

34
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,320
Fabrics.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
My Lord.

36
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,910
My Lord.

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,990
Sleeping?

38
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,400
I’d like to see

39
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,000
what new tricks you’re playing.

40
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,240
I, Qingqing, have seen a lot,

41
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,440
and am picky about beauty.

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
But

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,030
this skin,

44
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,280
this face,

45
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,470
in the three worlds,

46
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
only the word perfect can describe them.

47
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,310
And the forehead,

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,310
full and bright,

49
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,960
shines the charm of man

50
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,470
and the luster of jade.

51
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,280
Wish I could

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,680
have such a forehead.

53
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,560
What a shame.

54
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,680
He has the face

55
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,470
that makes women jealous,

56
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,150
but his heart is so ugly,

57
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,800
unforgiving, petty!

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,630
I know it.

59
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,840
I’m sorry.

60
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,870
Lord has a generous heart.

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,630
You’ll forgive me.

62
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,150
I’ll go cleaning.

63
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,560
The girl in green…

64
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
who is she?

65
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,150
Look, it’s beautiful!

66
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,120
Yeah.

67
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,910
The cakes are beautiful, too.

68
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,310
We have some free crispy durian cakes

69
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,750
and plum cakes for you.

70
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,870
No durian cakes, please.

71
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,870
We’re promoting durian

72
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,800
because it’s from my boss’s hometown.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,630
Any guest in our restaurant

74
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,030
who eats the durian cake

75
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,560
will get a delicate gift

76
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
made by paper-folding master Kongkong.

77
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,910
I want it!

78
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,000
Sure.

79
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,440
You…

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,750
Don’t you hate durian?

81
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,630
Why did you take mine?

82
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,280
I love it.

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yummy!

84
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,870
Thank you, Liuying.

85
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,630
I can’t believe he made

86
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,840
such a lovely thing
from a piece of paper.

87
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,870
It’s amazing!

88
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,720
I wanna figure it out.

89
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,960
How did he make it?

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
For you.

91
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,000
So cute!

92
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,680
You may flap its tail.

93
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,350
It moves! Amazing!

94
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,350
How did you make it?

95
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,710
Could you teach me?

96
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,560
This paper dragon is unique.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,470
I’m the only maker in the world.

98
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,440
It’s the only one?

99
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,950
I’ll take good care of it.

100
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,510
Liuying.

101
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,800
I knew it.

102
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,240
Whenever you call my name

103
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
you’ll touch my head.

104
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,350
Whenever I call you,

105
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,800
my hand is out of control.

106
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,240
Like this.

107
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,680
Liuying.

108
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,620
(Luofeng Pavilion)

109
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,350
Bingxing.

110
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,590
(Luofeng Pavilion)

111
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,000
Where are you going?

112
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,350
Let me guess.

113
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,910
It is a banquet,

114
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,200
an important banquet,

115
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,030
a banquet about peach flower, isn’t it?

116
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,470
The floral adornment on my forehead,

117
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,910
you saw it.

118
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,710
This is the floral adornment?

119
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
It’s beautiful!

120
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,510
Yes, it is.

121
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,150
Bingxing’s peach adornment

122
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
is always the most beautiful
in the Peach Feast.

123
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,390
The Peach Feast?

124
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,680
May I join you?

125
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
Is there something yummy?

126
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,150
Are there performances?

127
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,030
Have you done your job?

128
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,560
No.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,910
Back to work.

130
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,270
The most coldblooded Lord in the world!

131
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,390
He gives me so many works

132
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,590
that will never be done!

133
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,440
I’m not interested in the Peach Feast.

134
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,640
I’m interested in the floral adornment.

135
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,950
Nobody said only the feast attenders

136
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,440
could have the floral adornment.

137
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
It’s dark.

138
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,120
We can’t get to the town tonight.

139
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,030
We’ll camp here for the night.

140
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,200
Alright.

141
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,950
Marble,

142
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,350
you’re all right now.

143
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,390
We’ll camp here tonight.

144
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,270
Come on,

145
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,880
sleep.

146
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,470
Marble!

147
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,910
Marble,

148
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,590
do you like here

149
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,350
and wanna stay?

150
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,080
If you do like it,

151
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,350
take it to Xiahou’s Mansion.

152
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,030
It won’t like it.

153
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,470
It’s a free creature in nature.

154
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,270
I can’t be selfish.

155
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,710
Marble,

156
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,950
if you wanna go,

157
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,120
go as you like.

158
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,800
It goes.

159
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,910
I won’t do that to you.

160
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,120
I’ll never leave you.

161
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,640
I’ll always be good to you.

162
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,910
Will you?

163
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,200
But,

164
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,510
I have to serve my lady, always.

165
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,680
Doesn’t matter.

166
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,680
She can’t prevent me
from returning your favor.

167
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,150
It's returning the favor again.

168
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,000
For a thousand of years, Yuchi Longyan

169
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,800
never breaks a promise.

170
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,830
Since I’ll be your man,

171
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,320
let’s exchange the token.

172
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,080
Token?

173
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,880
What do you want?

174
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,510
Fallen-flower Valley!

175
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,000
The book says

176
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,470
the love token will be exchanged

177
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,680
in a place like a dreamland.

178
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,710
Tell me,

179
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,390
what token do you prefer?

180
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,390
Luminous pearl?

181
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,240
How about ambergris?

182
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,350
Or

183
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,200
tear of the North Sea Shark Men?

184
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,270
I…

185
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
I don’t need you to return

186
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,080
the favor.

187
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,150
Hard to decide?

188
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,800
Is it because I am somehow

189
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,560
different to him?

190
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,800
Did you give a token to every one

191
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,710
of your savors?

192
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,950
Definitely no.

193
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,470
I didn’t have a savor.

196
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,510
Not necessary.

197
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,270

198

which one

I’m a slave girl though,

254
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
a slave girl needs to rest,

255
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,560
because

256
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
the book says

257
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,510
she squats before jumping higher,

258
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,870
she rests before going further.

259
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,110
You don’t feed me,

260
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,230
at least you’d allow me to rest.

261
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,840
-I just…
-Shut it!

262
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,510
Can’t I have the floral makeup?

263
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,910
I’m your slave girl though,

264
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,230
if I look better,

265
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,870
it’s your grace.

266
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,630

I’ve ever seen.

My Lord,

269
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,630
can you make the floral adornment?

270
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,270
What?

271
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,360
You reject?

272
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,720
No, no, no!

273
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,150

274
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,080
Thank you, My Lord.

275
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,680
Isn’t it too close?

276
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,750
I need a good look at you.

277
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,600
Am I in my dream?

278
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,630
Close your eyes.

279
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
Done.

280
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,560

282
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,440
This is the meteor adornment.

283
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,390
Like it?

284
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,270
That bird needs to learn pecking order.

285
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
She dared throw me out.

286
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,960
Did I do anything wrong?

287
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,870
How could I get rid of the meteor?

288
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,750
Seems the meteor is her old scar.

289
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,390
It was a joke.

290
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,440
Don’t be so sad.

291
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,510
Because of the meteor scar,

292
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,910
they mock at me time and time again.

293
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
And you made it bigger.

294
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,800
I’m a little elf,

295
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,870
but I have my dignity.

296
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
I just wanted to be pretty.

297
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,030
Why did you do that to me!

298
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,390
I…

299
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,320
I didn’t do it well.

300
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,360
I’ll redo it.

301
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,360
No!

302
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,440
I was giving an order.

303
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,230
Close your eyes.

304
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,200
Turn around.

305
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,990
Open your eyes.

306
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,840
You’re welcome.

307
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,200
I didn’t thank you.

308
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,230
Don’t expect me to forgive you.

309
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,630
I can do it…

310
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,960
do it much better.

311
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,390
Is that so?

312
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,080
Next time I won’t give a hand.

313
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,110
Do it yourself.

314
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,030
Inerasable?

315
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,200
The mark is cast on her soul.

316
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,960
She’s just an elf.

317
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,390
That’s impossible.

318
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,230
Why does it

319
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,560
seem

320
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,800
sort of familiar?

321
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,360
It’s so weird.

322
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,800
I think of him

323
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,440
and my heart races.

324
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,110
I think of marrying her

325
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,840
and my heart beats so wildly.

It’s my favorite story.

331
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,600
You brought me my book.

332
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,870
The Dragon King on it is so handsome!

333
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,990
Better than me?

334
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,910
Certainly not.

335
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,630
He’s in his armor.

336
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,200
So heroic!

337
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,110

Why aren’t you afraid?

348
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,320

the Dragon King protects his love.

350
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,720
You believe in the book.

351
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,150
Do you believe in me?

352
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,910
Yes,

353
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,270
I do.

Yes.

364
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,720
Is forever possible?

367
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,750
We can’t get married.

368
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,800
It’s just a dream,

369
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,440

No, no, no.

376
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,110
I just…

377
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,320
wanna take a walk…
get some fresh air.

378
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,800
I never thought about running away.

379
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,510
The honest will be forgiven.

380
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,990
My Lord, pardon me, please.

381
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,630
Don’t punish me with hunger!

382
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,630
I’d starve to death!

383
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,230
I’d be a bird jerky!

384
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,360
Save a life and

385
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,910
-you’ll be…
-Enough!

386
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,870
Why do you run away?

387
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,680
I have to!

388
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,840
In here I’m an imprisoned slave girl,

389
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,110
washing and cooking,

390
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,030
an errand girl serving your reading,

391
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,910
and I’m disliked for talking too much.

392
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,320
You took my power.

393
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,990
I can’t find my real me.

394
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,200
A bird that doesn’t fly

395
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,750
has no difference from a chicken.

396
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,630
I was the prettiest in the birds’ realm!

397
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,600
Look at me now!

398
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,230
As black as tar!

399
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,750
Unsightly! Disgraceful!

400
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,560
I know. Go back.

401
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,270
What is the penalty?

402
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,910
I’m thinking.

403
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,510
My Lord,

404
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,560
you have a lot to live up with,

405
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,840
don’t waste time on the petty things.

406
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,360
The penalty would be cleaning.

407
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,230
It’s enough.

408
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,080
My Lord,

409
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,510
Bingxing has located the Yin Soul.

410
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,630
Good.

411
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,800
