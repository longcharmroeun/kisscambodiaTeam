The promise between us...

19
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,070
My parents were gone.

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,880
So, the wedding could be simple.

21
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,110
Why are you silent?

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,880
I’m thinking

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,560
if I can help you realize

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,520
any other wishes.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,960
Then promise me

26
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,470
you’ll protect yourself well.

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,990
Don’t get hurt again.

28
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,470
It was a long time

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,190
when you looked for Miss.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,910
I was worried about you.

31
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,040
You won’t worry about me anymore.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
Forget me.

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,680
What do you mean?

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,910
I

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,240
can’t marry you.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
That makes sense.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
You are Dragon King.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
I’m just a mortal.

40
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,830
That’s the reason.

41
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,830
It’s because

42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,070
I have to marry your miss.

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,910
Miss?

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Why?

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
What I said

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,160
was just a misunderstanding.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,830
Don’t take it seriously.

48
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,040
Alright.

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,830
I know

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,070
it’s just a misunderstanding.

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Dragon King.

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,800
You’re going to marry Miss.

53
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,550
We should

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
keep a distance.

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,470
Miss and you

56
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,270
both mean the world

57
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,910
to me.

58
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you heartbroken?

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,150
You don’t understand.

60
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,350
Of course I do.

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,030
I’ve watched many operas.

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,800
I know you’re heartbroken.

63
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,190
So is Miss Liuying.

64
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,310
You love each other,

65
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,240
but you can’t be together.

66
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,470
His skin.

67
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,280
His look.

68
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,280
In the Heaven, the underworld,
and the mortal world,

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,400
he’s absolutely perfect.

71
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,350
My Lord.

72
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,030
Qingqing is really gone.

73
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,750
But she has lost all her power.

74
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,800
How could she get out
of Luofeng Pavilion?

75
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,070
Without her, Luofeng Pavilion is
much quieter.

76
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,560
Should I get her back with some men?

77
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,310
Never mind.

78
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,120
Miss.

79
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,800
Do you feel unwell?

80
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,520
I’ve fully recovered.

81
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Really.

82
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,190
Thanks to Dragon King.

83
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,520
I heard that

84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,960
he even fought with immortals for me.

85
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,590
He’s really kind to you.

86
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
Liuying, you know what?

87
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,190
He said he’d marry me.

88
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,910
I believe he’ll be a good husband.

89
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,520
Congratulations, Miss.

90
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
But you know,

91
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,840
will my parents disagree with it?

92
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,120
Master said that,

93
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,070
he was saved by a tiger demon
when he was young.

94
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,240
So, he bears gratitude in heart.

95
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,870
Madam believes in Buddhism.

96
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,440
She is kind to all beings.

97
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,440

98
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,590

100
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,350
is a good man to marry.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,720
Yes.

102
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,280
Dragon King also said,

103
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,560
he’d move and live here
after we get married.

104
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,400
It’ll be the same as before.

105
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,870
Nothing will change.

106
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,150
Right?

107
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,190

I’ve promised

211
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,000

(Xiahou’s Mansion)

215
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,110
Liuying.

216
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,990
What happened to you recently?

217
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,870
Why do you look upset?

218
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,750
I see.

219
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,750
You must’ve secretly read the play.

220
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,270
Yes, I’ve read the play.

221
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,910
Don’t read it again.

222
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,600
By the way,

223
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,630
do you remember my cousin Zhiyuan?

224
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,440
He came here for the exam,

225
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,560
but accidentally fell off the horse.

226
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,390
My mother got him to recuperate
in the mansion.

227
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,870
She said you’re meticulous

228
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,360
and asked you to look after him.

229
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,630
Yes.

230
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,270
You blinked. You lost.

231
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,510
It doesn’t count.

232
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,990
A bug was flying by.

233
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,510
Immortal Ziyang.

234
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,320
It was dust just now.
Now it’s a bug.

235
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,510
Stop cheating me.

236
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,600
Plus this round,

237
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,200
you’ve lost 3,941 times in total.

238
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,870
I’ll tell your lord on you.

239
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,750
I was told that an old friend has come.

240
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,270
So, it’s Immortal Ziyang.

241
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
You are not blind.

242
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
Bingxing said, the repair of sky net

243
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,960
greatly consumed your power.

244
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,630
That seems to be an exaggeration.

245
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,840
Sorry, My Lord.

246
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,870
I made a mistake. Please punish me.

247
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,870
Yes. Yes. Yes.

248
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,510
You’d better punish her to be a judge
at River of Tears.

249
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,200
How to punish my maid

250
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,270
is not your concern.

251
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,030
Yes. Why should I meddle with
your business?

252
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,600
I’m off.

253
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Immortal Ziyang.

254
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,390
You lost.

255
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,270
Alright. Alright.

256
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,750
I know you think highly of yourself.

257
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,480
You’re headstrong and thin-skinned.

258
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,480
You never ask for help.

259
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,910
If it’s not for Bingxing...

260
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,870
Here you are.

261
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,870
This is...

262
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,800
A love token someone gave you
a millennia ago.

263
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,360
Do you take it seriously?

264
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,200
It’s Zisui Yangyan.

265
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,600
As hot as dragon fire.

266
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,390
Of course. Wearing it,

267
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,390
you’ll be able to forcefully
take the Yin soul

268
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,560
and use her to fix the sky net.

269
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,030
Is it made with your power?

270
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,200
Of course.

271
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,150
You’re welcome.

272
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,440
You can only have it for three days.

273
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,030
I’ll surely get it back in three days.

274
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,270
Thank you, Immortal Ziyang.

275
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,910
Alright. You’re welcome.

276
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,150
I’m off.

277
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,960
I swear I’ll never ever

278
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,200
bet with you again.

279
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,360
This medicine is effective,

280
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
(Xu Zhiyuan)
but it hurts.

281
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,150
Young Master. Please bear with it.

282
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,600
Dragon King.

283
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,630
Dragon King.

284
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,080
-Dragon...
-Shut up.

285
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Why are you here?

286
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,150
Do you forget it?

287
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,720
You asked me to look after Liuying,

288
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,110
so I’m watching here.

289
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,440
Have you been here

290
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,870
all these days?

291
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,910
Day and night. Not a step away.

292
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,750
I’m a bird demon,

293
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,110
but I’m a bird of duty.

294
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,910
Is she

295
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
alright?

296
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,960
She looks very well.

297
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,600
But Dragon King,

298
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,360
you don’t look very well.

299
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
Are you sick?

300
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,680
I feel suffocated

301
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,270
and can’t breathe.

302
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,680
I want to fight.

303
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,030
Gosh.

304
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,990
You... Are you jealous?

305
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,440
Even Dragon King is jealous?

306
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,150
Jealous?

307
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,030
Jealousy is a kind of description.

308
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,270
How to put it? It means,

309
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,080
when you see

310
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
Liuying is intimidate with a man,

311
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,230
you wish that man could be you.

312
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,270
When she talks and laughs with others,

313
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,440
you wish you could be
the one with her.

314
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,800
When she’s gentle to others,

315
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,720
you wish you could be

316
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,200
the one by her side.

317
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,320
But it’s not you in reality.

318
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,030
So, you’re angry,

319
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,560
worried, and anxious.

320
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,030
You feel bad and sick.

321
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,030
Yet you can do nothing

322
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,200
but to be jealous.

323
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,630
You feel bad like drinking
a jar of vinegar.

324
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,560
Seeing is believing.

325
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,680
This is how a jealous man looks like.

326
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,680
Interesting.

327
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,990
-Interesting!
-Shut up.

328
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,360
Do you want to know
how to relieve the jealousy?

329
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,270
Let me think.

330
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,630
You can crazily smash things

331
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
or drown your sorrows with wine.

332
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,080
Stupid and naive.

333
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,110
Smashing things and drinking

334
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,320
cannot relieve

335
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,480
any of my bad feelings.

336
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,510
Young Master.

337
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,960
Keep a distance.

338
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,510
Stupid and naive.

339
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,030
How dare you!

340
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,030
You don’t call me along for drinking.

341
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,870
Why are you drinking alone?

342
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
Looks like something is bothering you.

343
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,750
The wine made by Immortal of Wine
is tasty

344
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,390
and also miraculous.

345
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,990
It can cure jealousy.

346
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,200
You want to marry this girl,

347
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,750
but you have to marry that girl.

348
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,600
This time, I come

349
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,600
with a worse message.

350
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,390
Days ago, I looked over
the Book of Fate,

351
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,080
and saw Xiahou’s Mansion

352
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,080
would be involved in a rebellious case.

353
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,800
Emperor would be outrageous.

354
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,630
Xiahou’s Mansion would be confiscated.

355
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,910
Men would be enslaved
and women whored.

356
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,600
What about others?

357
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,910
You should check the Book of Fate

358
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,200
in my library.

359
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,460
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

360
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,800
Your cousin will surely succeed
in this exam.

361
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,320
I plan to marry Liuying to him.

362
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,080
If Zhiyuan can really succeed,

363
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,990
we’ll have bet on the right person.

364
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,840
Even if he fails,

365
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,320
we’ll lose nothing.

366
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,320
Father.

367
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,110
It depends on Liuying’s will.

368
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
I don’t think she’ll agree.

369
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,680
She’s a maid.
Why would she disagree?

370
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
Besides, marrying your cousin

371
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,870
is a high honor for her.

372
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,080
Father, she and I are like sisters.

373
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,840
That’s why you should persuade her.

374
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,870
If Zhiyuan has a great future,

375
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,840
she’ll also enjoy the honor.

376
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,600
Don’t you want her
to have a good marriage?

377
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,200
More than a maid, she’s
being an attendant.

378
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,720
Badly, Dragon King isn’t here.

379
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,390
Or else, I could see him jealous again.

380
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Here comes the devil.

381
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,510
Your Highness...

382
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,600
It’s you!

383
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,150
You want to flee?

384
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Yes,

385
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,910
but you are stopping me, aren’t you?

386
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
How do you know I am here?

387
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,200
A surprise anyway.

388
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,840
My Lord, please spare me.

389
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,560
Thank you, My Lord.

390
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,440
What a strong power.

391
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,110
It’s warm. What is it?

392
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,110
No, it’s hot.

393
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,720
I got it.

394
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,080
With this, you can get close to Liuying

395
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,390
and take her soul away.

396
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,870
You...! You...!

397
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,600
You are such a human-like devil!

398
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,080
Liuying is a nice person.

399
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,990
Saving a person is better than
building a seven-level pagoda.

400
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,870
She’s worth

401
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,440
a 49-level pagoda,

402
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,680
even beyond the sky!

403
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,200
Just because she’s born with Yin soul,

404
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,510
you break heavenly rules
and forcefully capture her.

405
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,840
It’s unfair to capture her.

406
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,080
But to ensure the peace
of mortal world,

407
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,990
she must be sacrificed.

408
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,110
That’s an excuse!

409
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,270
I don’t believe it.

410
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,600
The world is so big.

411
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,870
Must her soul be used
to fix the sky net?

412
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,320
What if the sky net breaks again?

413
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,910
Get another soul?

414
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,510
Anyway, there’re countless souls
in the world.

415
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,030
No need to cherish or care about them.

416
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,800
Is this the so-called Heaven?

417
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,200
In my view,

418
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,080
you are the same as demons,

419
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,800
selfish and horrible.

420
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,680
Qingqing.

421
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,230
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

422
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,960
Dragon King. You’re back in time.

423
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:08,870
Listen to me.

424
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,320
It was so close.

425
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,680
Luckily, I watched over her closely

426
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
and got her out of the great danger.

427
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,510
What did Xu Zhiyuan do?

428
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,480
Not him.

429
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,800
It’s the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

430
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,990
He meant to take her soul away

431
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,960
with this.

432
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,910
Zisui Yangyan!

433
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,360
You have good eyes.

434
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,220
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

435
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,030
Why do you want Liuying’s soul?

436
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,320
My duty.

437
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,320
To hurt Liuying?

438
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,800
In your dreams.

439
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,110
You know it well.

440
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,390
You’re not my match.

441
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,360
Dragon King.

442
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,230
Why are you against me for a maid?

443
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,270
Look!

444
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,800
You’ve spoken your true thought!

445
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,440
You look down on maids!

446
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,080
You take lightly of their lives!

447
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,360
Your soul should be deprived
for breaking into Luofeng Pavilion.

448
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,030
I’ve spared your life.

449
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,750
But you forced me to be your maid

450
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,990
and sealed my power.

451
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,990
You asked me to practice singing

452
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,960
in that damp, black and cold
River of Tears.

453
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,200
You’re tone deaf.

454
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,990
Singing there, you wouldn’t
disturb anyone.

455
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,080
Why did you paint me

456
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,150
like a clown?

457
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,840
Do you think maids need no respect

458
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,990
or dignity?

459
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,270
But I helped you

460
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,870
fix your preach-blossom makeup.

461
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,230
He’s been as cold as ice,

462
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,150
now bickering with a bird demon.

463
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,230
It’s weird.

464
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,720
You punished me
and didn’t allow me to eat

465
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
to make me weak,

466
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,840
get sick and...

467
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,800
But you were lively enough to flee.

468
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,270
Were you weak?

469
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,200
You...

470
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,440
Continue.

471
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,600
It’s rare that you say so many words.

472
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,320
You destroyed Zisui Yangyan!

473
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,750
I’m letting you know

474
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,440
Liuying is mine.

475
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,990
Don’t you dare lay a finger on her.

476
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,750
Yes! Yes! Yes!

477
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,750
Don’t you dare lay a finger on her!

478
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,990
So, Xiahou Xue and you...

479
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,390
Taking back Xiahou Xue’s soul

480
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
was to prevent Liuying
from being sealed into sky net.

481
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,510
Liuying is the most important person
to me.

482
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,750
You gave up the millennium
opportunity of ascension

483
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,750
to protect Xiahou Xue, but...

484
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,870
For Liuying,

485
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,030
I’ll be against the whole Heaven

486
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,270
to protect her,

487
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,030
not to mention Luofeng Pavilion.

488
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,390
Find another way

489
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,990
to fix the sky net.

490
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,230
You are such a human-like devil.

491
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
Selfish and horrible!

492
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,270
Qingqing.

493
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,440
She’s so bold,

494
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,630
but why am I not angry?
