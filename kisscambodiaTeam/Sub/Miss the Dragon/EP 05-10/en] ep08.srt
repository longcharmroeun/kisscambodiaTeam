Xue Qianxun,

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,630
you…

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,960
If my guess is right,

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,880
you failed to capture
the Immortal of Yin again?

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,480
Sorry.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,880
Your Zisui Yangyan

23
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,840
has been taken away by Yuchi Longyan.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,280
That cursed scumbag!

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,040
Come on.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,470
Have a cup of tea.

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,710
To ease your anger.

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,990
I wonder if you can be honest with me
about one thing.

29
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,240
That depends.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,880
2,000 years ago,

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,160
what on earth happened to me?

32
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,040
This is funny.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
You’re asking me
about what happened to you?

34
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,070
Not to mention we’ve known each other
no more than 1,000 years.

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Anyway, don’t you remember anything?

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,630
I only remember
I used to be the Lonely Star

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,760
and got punished
by being deprived of a rib

38
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,470
which was then made into
the Fleeting Pipa

39
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,320
and had garrisoned
the Luofeng Pavilion for 3,000 years.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,270
That’s all?

41
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,910
Did you drink the Lethe Tea?

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,800
This tea…!

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
It’s not the Lethe Tea.

44
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,630
I often recall a green figure.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,800
Are you sure it’s green

46
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,760
instead of pink?

47
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,830
Yes.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,320
Then it must be…

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,190
You are yearning for amorous love.

50
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,320
If you want to know your past,

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,800
just turn to the Immortal of Fate.

52
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,420
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,990
Liuying,

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,400
what’s stopping you
from marrying my cousin?

55
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,350
Miss, I’m just a maid.

56
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,960
I don’t deserve him.

57
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,910
Don’t worry about that.

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,070
Father has already decided to
take you in as his foster daughter.

59
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,350
Later,

60
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,270
you can get married in the identity of

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,430
Xiahou’s younger miss.

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,470
You two will be a fine match.

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,830
Besides, you will be his legal wife

64
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,430
instead of his concubine.

65
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,710
Miss.

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,830
What is it?

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
I…

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,520
I wanna stay by your side forever, Miss.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,350
Liuying.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Liuying,

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,280
you want her to be happy, don’t you?

72
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,030
As long as you marry Xu Zhiyuan,

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
both she and I will be happy.

74
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,750
I assure you

75
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,720
that I will hold

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,000
a grand wedding for you.

77
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,590
And

78
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,000
I have found you a maid.

79
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,750
Come in.

80
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,030
Nice to meet you, Liuying. I’m Qingqing.

81
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,560
You smell really good.

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,070
Nice to meet you, Qingqing.

83
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,620
(Book of Fate)

84
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,470
The doom of the Xiahou family is coming.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,070
By the end of the year,

86
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,070
the whole family will disappear.

87
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,350
In that case,

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,150
is there any way

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,590
to help Liuying survive this?

90
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
This man can turn ill luck into good.

91
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,750
He can prosper his wife and child.

92
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,520
If Liuying marries him,

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
she can die a natural death.

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,420
(Xu Zhiyuan)

95
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,630
Xu Zhiyuan…

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
From now on,

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,240
he will take care of you for me.

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,590
Dragon King.

99
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Do you really

100
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,000
want me to marry her cousin?

101
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
It is

102
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,960
for your own good.

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,310
I don’t think so.

104
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,560
He’s a good man.

105
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,070
And he likes you.

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,520
So what?

107
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,190
A marriage

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,960
needs mutual love.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,440
Love

110
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,150
can be cultivated through time.

111
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Cultivated?

112
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,470
But my heart has left me

113
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,720
and followed someone else.

114
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,440
There’s no heart or affection,

115
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,960
how will love be cultivated?

116
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,560
I will not marry him.

117
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,750
As for the memories you abandoned,

118
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
I will keep them.

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Liuying.

120
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,910
Don’t try to persuade me.

121
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,720
On this matter,

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,520
no one can make the decision for me.

123
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,350
I never abandoned our memories.

124
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,960
I just want you to live a happy life.

125
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,950
The Star Halo!

126
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,320
Look!

127
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,030
It’s so beautiful.

128
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,080
Witnessed by the Star Halo,

129
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,800
I’m giving you our love token.

130
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,240
The joy and romance I brought you…

131
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,150
The secrets between you and me…

132
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,240
You will forget them all.

133
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,760
I will be the only one

134
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,000
who remembers them all forever.

135
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
You only need to remember

136
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,470
the memories you find

137
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,080
happy and beautiful

138
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,910
were brought…

139
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
By him.

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
You don’t like it?

141
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,880
I’ll have it.

142
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,470
But as I recall,

143
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,590
you don’t like
crispy durian cake either.

144
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,080
Why don’t you want to eat it?

145
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
As long as I eat it,

146
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,080
you will have the paper fan.

147
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,910
The fireflies all over the sky
I gave you

148
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
will never be given to another girl.

149
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,560
Liuying,

150
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
after you wake up,

151
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
you will agree to marry him.

152
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,000
Remember,

153
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,240
she loves
chestnuts roasted with brown sugar

154
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,910
only cooked by the pedlar
on Chang’an Street.

155
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,150
You need to buy two bags of them
at one time

156
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,830
in case she wants more

157
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,200
and you have to buy them again.

158
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,950
She loves watching petals fall.

159
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
Every time
when watching shedding petals,

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
she can be fully absorbed.

161
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,470
How could he know that?

162
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,470
Remember to put a cloak on her.

163
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,390
I’ve memorized them all.

164
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Anything to add?

165
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,510
One more thing,

166
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,590
she’s dependent on her own bed.

167
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,000
Without her quilt and pillow

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,030
being around,

169
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
she couldn’t fall asleep.

170
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,760
Wait.

171
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,470
How could you know all of that?

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,640
Your miss told me that.

173
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,200
My miss?

174
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,240
She treats me so well.

175
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,350
Thank you, Mister.

176
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,240

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,240

I never met him before,

180
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,950
but I have a sense of déjà vu.

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,990
“The belongings of a maid

300
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,720
are mostly worthless.

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,630
Except for the bride’s jewels,

302
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,030
all the other stuff should be left

303
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,270
and changed.”

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,230
Humans

305
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,200

306
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,200
I gotta go.

307
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,840
-I gotta bring her the quilt…
-Hold on.

308
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,440
Do you know where Liuying

309
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,230
keeps her painting?

310
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,870
Painting? I didn’t see it.

311
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,230
Maybe she has lost it.

312
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,320
Or maybe… She took it with her?

313
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Do you need me to find it?

314
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,200
It’s fine if she has lost it.

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,080

Why are you sighing?

333
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,750
It’s really a pity that

334
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,440
you don’t even touch
the osmanthus cakes.

335
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,510
Then you should be happy
that they are yours.

00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,440
I don’t understand

342

343
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,150
You can consult me.

00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,390
What’s puzzling you?

345
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,840
How come the woman I love

346
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,910
fell in love with another man so soon?

347
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,480
Because you changed her memories.

348
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,320
Now the hero in her love story

349
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,680
is Xu Zhiyuan.

350
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,680
I did that

351
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,630
only to make her marry Xu Zhiyuan.

352
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,320
I didn’t expect

353
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,110
that she would fall in love with him.

354
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,800
But if she hadn’t fallen
in love with him,

355
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,630
she wouldn’t have married him.

356
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,110
All of this now

357
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,680
-was due to your arrangement…
-Shut up.

358
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,320
You know nothing.

359
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,560
This is not fair.

360
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,750
All of you have someone to love.

361
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,720
The only sad, angry and upset one here

362
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,680

What were you thinking?

371
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,270
I was thinking… As I remember,

372
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,230
my husband doesn’t like durian,

373
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,200
but why did he say

374
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,560
that he liked it?

375
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,230
Is it possible that person you remember
is someone else?

376
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,480
How come there’s someone else?

377
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,800
Nonsense.

378
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,870
My husband is the only man I love
in my lifetime.

379
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,840
What’s good about that?

380
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,440
It is good.

381
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,560
I hope I could be with him
in all my lifetimes.

382
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,270
In all your lifetimes?

383
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
You are not satisfied with one lifetime.

384
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,870
You want all lifetimes.

385
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,630
With the same guy!

386
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,200
That would be so boring.

387
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,230
Don’t you think so?

388
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
Take these chestnuts for example.

389
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,560
However sweet and tasty they are,

390
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,200
you’d get tired of eating them one day.

391
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,600
You eat meals and drink water every day,

392
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,750
but are you tired of that?

393
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,030
The mutual love
starts sweet and romantic.

394
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,600
After the marriage life starts,

395
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,720
the real love can be felt
as time goes by,

396
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,360
like the spring water’s sweet taste.

397
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,990
But I don’t know why

398
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,510
after we got married,

399
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,080
the feelings before are gone.

400
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,600
That is normal

401
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,990
because they are two different persons.

402
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,510
Two persons?
