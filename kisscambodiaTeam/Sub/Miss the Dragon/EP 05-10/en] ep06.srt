=Episode 6=

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,670
Millions of years ago,
at the beginning of chaos,

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,310
the war between immortals and devils
caused turbulence of the three worlds.

19
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,600
Then, the ancient Nuwa

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,560
gathered the power of immortal and devil

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,390
and made a sky net of Yin Spirit Power

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,390
to seal the Evil Spirit.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,390
After vicissitudes,

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
the sky net got loose

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,110
and cracks,

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
which needs to be repaired with.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,400
Therefore, every time the immortal falls
and the soul dissipates,

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,120
Luofeng Pavilion will collect
the scattered Yin Spirit Power

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,800
and store it in the Lotus Box
in case of need.

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
Because the Spirit Power

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,430
has the essence of heaven and earth

32
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,760
which is given by ancient Nuwa,

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,320
it contains great energy.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,680
Unexpectedly, the unconscious
Yin Spirit Power

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
got a divine consciousness

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,470
and naturally turned into a new soul,

37
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,680
imitated the immortals to go through
the immortal’s test

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,960
and secretly came to the human world.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,800
If the one with the Yin Soul

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,430
dies in her bed,

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,470
we’ll not be able to seal her soul

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,710
by the sky net?

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,710
Yes, My Lord,

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
unless she dies by accident,

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
commits suicide

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,270
or we use force to seal her soul.

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,320
My Lord, if we don’t repair the sky net,

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,910
the Evil Spirit will escape
and cause troubles again.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
The fastest way to do

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,520
is to repair it with the Yin Soul.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,430
I’m willing to undertake
this responsibility

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,800
and go immediately to seize this soul.

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,910
Now we are talking about a soul!

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,430
Why do you say it so easily like
drinking a cup of tea?

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
I’d better escape as soon as possible

56
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,680
before they

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,520
use me to mend the net.

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,830
You still have conscience.

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,120
The Yin Soul can protect itself.

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,960
We can’t force to seize it
if it’s still in the body.

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,900
(Xiahou Xue)

62
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,880
Xiahou Xue?

63
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,190
Yes.

64
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,800
That girl made an oath with Xiahou Xue

65
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,320
of dying on the same day.

66
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,960
If this oath comes true…

67
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,960
Copy the oath of Liuying and Xiahou Xue

68
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,120
and put into the Oath Tower.

69
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,320
Yes.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,800
The oath in

71
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,630
Oath Tower will always come true.

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Liuying!

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,270
She is my benefactor!

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
I have to find a way to inform her!

75
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I have to save her!

76
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,430
But Xiahou Xue is just
an ordinary person.

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,590
How about we start with her?

78
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,720
We’ll decide it later.

79
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,150
My Lord…

80
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,310
Your penalty.

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
Drink this bowl of bitter tea.

82
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,520
My Lord!

83
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,240
This is not a bowl!

84
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,840
It’s a pot!

85
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,350
I knew it! The evilest and
most cold-blooded man

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
in the world is him!

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,440
I thought I just needed to be hungry
for days.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Now,

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,280
I don’t even have the appetite to eat.

90
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,560
Wait,

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,680
now I have to tell Liuying first.

92
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,510
If I still have my power,

93
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,670
I can fly back there in a blink!

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,240
If I could turn into my real…

95
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,590
Why can I suddenly change back?

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,240
You even know how to paint?

97
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,470
That book of yours tells no truth.

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,680
Let me draw you a real Dragon King.

99
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,720
Here. You can also draw it.

100
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,070
I don’t know how to draw.

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
It’s OK.

102
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,150

103

me?

105
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,680
It’s us.

106
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,190
Can I

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,280
see him again?

108
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,000
What am I thinking about?

109
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,560
He is the Dragon King.

110
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,520
He has no time to see me.

111

Why don’t you eat one?

189
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,440
♪Like a thick win flows into the sea♪

190
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,230
♪And into your heart♪

191
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:36,760
♪And into your heart♪

192
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,780
(Xia)

193
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,710
What’s going on?

194
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,800
Miss, don’t come out.

195
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,910
There seems to be
a wolf demon around here.

196
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,830
Miss! Why are you out?

197
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,510
-Mother!
-Miss!

198
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,240
-Xue!
-Mother!

199
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,510
Xue! Don’t come over!

200
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,760
Mother!

201
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
Miss! Watch out!

202
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Hurry up! Protect Xue!

203
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,710
-Xue!
-Yes, sir!

204
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,080
-Miss!
-Xue!

205
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
Miss!

206
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,320
Xue!

207
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,560
Miss! Are you all right?

208
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,390
-Mother!
-Xue!

209
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,510
-Help!
-Are you all right?

210
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,680
Miss!

211
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,150
Xue!

212
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,710
-Xue!
-Miss!

213
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,320
-Xue!
-Miss!

214
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,380
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

215
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,710
Finally, you’re back.

216
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,640
What’s wrong?

217
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Miss was attacked by a wolf demon
on her way back home.

218
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,560
She was so badly wounded

219
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,800
that the physician said

220
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,910
she had only days left to live.

221
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,950
Miss!

222
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,590
I knew I couldn’t leave you
for a moment.

223
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
What happened?

224
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,590
Dragon King,

225
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,270
you said there was an elixir, right?

226
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,440
Miss Xue was attacked by a wolf demon

227
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,510
and the physician says she is dying.

228
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,200
Don’t worry.

229
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,800
I will go get you the elixir right now.

230
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,830
Don’t cry, OK?

231
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Cultivate it with elegance.

232
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,350
Strengthen it with energy.

233
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,680
Protect it with spirit.

234
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,710
Give me some of your elixir.

235
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,120
You got hurt again?

236
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,560
I need to help someone.

237
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,760
Who is that important to you?

238
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,440
A person I met once.

239
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,560
I’m afraid it’s

240
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,470
love at first sight.

241
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Stop your nonsense.

242
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,830
Just give me that.

243
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Then tell me

244
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,830
who it is.

245
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,270
If you keep doing this,

246
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,270
I will get it myself.

247
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,440
Why do you always do this?

248
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,390
Demon and human are in
two different worlds.

249
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,270
Don’t go…

250
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,150
too far.

251
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,800
Miss,

252
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,150
you will be fine.

253
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,750
Dragon King said

254
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,840
he would help you.

255
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,910
Liuying.

256
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,360
Dragon King.

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,840
You promised not to cry.

258
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,720
Help her to have this.

259
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,200
Miss!

260
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,870
Dragon King,

261
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,560
is she alright?

262
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,840
Miss!

263
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Miss!

264
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,030
Miss!

265
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,230
Miss!

266
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,560
Miss… is dead.

267
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,320
Looks like the wolf demon

268
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,800
poisoned her.

269
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,870
The elixir can cure wounds,
but not detoxicate.

270
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,230
What to do? What to do now?

271
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,110
Don’t worry.

272
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,600
Her soul has just left.

273
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,960
I will go chase it now.

274
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,990
Miss!

275
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,720
Miss!

276
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,940
(Luofeng Pavilion)

277
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,390
Annoying barrier!

278
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,230
Haven’t my powers been fully restored?

279
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,320
Is there nothing I can do

280
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,910
but change back to my original self?

281
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,510
That’s really how Lord is.

282
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,840
Concentrate! Focus on it!

283
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,030
Try again!

284
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,030
(Luofeng Pavilion)

285
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,080
Dragon King? Why are you here?

286
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,510
Why are you here?

287
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,390
I was caught by Lord of Luofeng Pavilion

288
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
to be his maidservant.

289
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,990
That’s a great convenience.

290
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,080
-Take me to find Xiahou…
-Wait.

291
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,480
Listen to me first.

292
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,030
Go tell Liuying to

293
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,910
protect Xiahou Xue well

294
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,800
and bless her a long life.

295
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,560
If Xiahou Xue is dead,

296
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,110
Liuying will also die after that.

297
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,390
My Lord, Xiahou Xue died by accident.

298
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,600
Her soul has arrived at
Luofeng Pavilion.

299
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,990
The oath has been recorded in
the Oath Tower.

300
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,510
With seven days,

301
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,800
Liuying will die of the oath.

302
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,910
My Lord,

303
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,680
a dragon demon intruded into our barrier

304
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,080
and hurt our people,

305
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,680
saying that he wants Xiahou Xue’s soul.

306
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,380
(Luofeng Pavilion)

307
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,140
(Luofeng Pavilion)

308
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,080
Give me Xiahou Xue’s soul!

309
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,820
(Luofeng Pavilion)

310
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,300
(Luofeng Pavilion)

311
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,060
(Luofeng Pavilion)

312
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,720
Do you know trespassing

313
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,360
on Luofeng Pavilion is a felony?

314
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,990
In this world,

315
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,560
no one can stop me.

316
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,500
(Luofeng Pavilion)

317
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,560
Dragon King.

318
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,910
Dragon King,

319
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,680
why don’t you go cultivate to become
the immortal dragon,

320
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,910
but come to Luofeng Pavilion

321
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,990
for Xiahou Xue’s soul?

322
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,360
Give me Xiahou Xue’s soul!

323
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,200
Or,

324
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,150
I will destroy your pavilion.

325
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,870
You can take her soul away…

326
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,720
My Lord!

327
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,630
But,

328
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,110
I have to go through the laws of Heaven.

329
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,440
Go ahead.

330
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,750
You have to marry Xiahou Xue

331
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,990
and guard her through three tribulations

332
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,750
if you want to take her away.

333
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,390
I can’t guard her through
three tribulations,

334
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,200
let alone marrying her.

335
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,750
There are no other ways

336
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,320
to do it in this world.

337
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,720
The tribulation comes once
in a thousand years.

338
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,110
Dragon King, you’d better think twice.

339
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
Xiahou Xue and Liuying

340
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,800
will die

341
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,230
together,

342
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,910
right?

343
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,480
How do you know that?

344
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,630
I’m asking you.

345
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,820
(Luofeng Pavilion)

346
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,600
Yes.

347
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,910
Then I will take

348
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,150
this oath out from the Oath Tower.

349
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,800
The Oath Tower is built by ancient Nuwa.

350
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,990
Even God can’t change it,

351
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,600
let alone you and me.

352
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,680
Then, I’ll find it myself.

353
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,230
Her soul has been hidden as an ant.

354
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,720
No matter who it is,

355
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,990
even with a thousand eyes and hands,
no one will be able to find her.

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
So,

357
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,440
I have no choice but to say yes?

358
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,560
Dragon King,

359
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,360
(Luofeng Pavilion)

360
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,600
if you insist on giving up
the tribulation,

361
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,200
you will have to wait for
a thousand years.

362
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,440
Guard Xiahou Xue

363
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,840
to go through three tribulations.

364
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,270
Deal.

365
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,680
Will anything bad happen?

366
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,750
No way.

367
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,630
He is the Dragon King.

368
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,600
Everything will be fine.

369
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,630
Miss,

370
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,320
you will be fine.

371
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,230
You will.

372
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,200
They say you are the Dragon King.

373
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,270
You can save me, right?

374
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,990
And, I will marry you.

375
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,560
We have no other choices. Let’s go.

376
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,150
Dragon King, are you really

377
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,960
going to wait for another thousand years
before becoming Immortal Dragon?

378
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,840
I don’t understand why you did this.

379
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,440
You don’t need to understand.

380
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,230
My Lord,

381
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,230
you really allow him
to take Xiahou Xue away?

382
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,630
It’s a promise. Anything wrong?

383
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,680
But,

384
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,110
what about the sky net?

385
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,030
Liuying.

386
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,960
Dragon King!

387
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Is everything alright?

388
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,680
Don’t worry. It’s fine.

389
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Miss!

390
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,600
Miss! You’re finally alright.

391
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,630
Dragon King,

392
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,560
thank you.

393
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,390
I’m… I’m just too excited.

394
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,110
I’ll go tell this good news

395
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,630
to Master and Madam.

396
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,510
The Star Halo really shows up again!

397
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,870
Star Halo…

398
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,560
About our promise…

399
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,990
My parents passed away.

400
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,870
So, we just need a simple wedding.

401
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,720
But I need to say goodbye to
Master and Miss Xue.

402
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,720
They are like my family.

403
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,150
Why don’t you say something?

404
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,840
I’m wondering

405
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,510
if there is anything else

406
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,390
I can do for you.

407
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,630
Nothing else.

408
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,360
You and Miss Xue are all well.

409
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,480
I have no other wishes.

410
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,680
Think twice.

411
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,800
I can help you

412
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,360
to do anything you want.

413
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,320
Then, promise me

414
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,800
to protect yourself.

415
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,200
Don’t get hurt again.

416
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,840
It took you a long time to go

417
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,560
find Miss Xue back last time.

418
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,200
I was so worried.

419
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,630
You don’t need to worry about me
in the future.

420
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,990
Liuying,

421
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,230
you really don’t need to
worry about me anymore.

422
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,480
Just forget me.

423
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,960
Take this as a dream.

424
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,510
What do you mean?

425
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,600
I…

426
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,870
I can’t marry you.

427
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,030
That’s right.

428
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,480
You’re the Dragon King.

429
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,720
I’m just an ordinary person.

430
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,320
It’s not like that.

431
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,390
Because

432
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,680
I have to marry Xiahou Xue.

433
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,510
Miss?

434
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,030
Why?

435
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,910
Remind the Dragon King

436
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,510
of that no ordinary people

437
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,150
can know our deal.

438
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,990
Or, all the immortals or human beings
who know it

439
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,270
will be punished severely.

440
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,910
What I said before was just

441
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,990
a mistake.

442
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,560
Don’t take it seriously.
