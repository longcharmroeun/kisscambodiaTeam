Miss.

18

Miss?

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,160
Liuying!

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,920
What were you thinking?

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,110
I was thinking... As I remember,

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,070
my husband doesn’t like durian,

23
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,200
but why did he say

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,480
that he liked it?

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,110
Is it possible that the person
you remember is someone else?

26
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,430
How come there’s someone else?

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,710
Nonsense.

28
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,710
My husband is the only man I love
in my lifetime.

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,680
What’s good about that?

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,350
It is good.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,470
I hope I could be with him
in all my lifetimes.

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,160
In all your lifetimes?

33
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,270
You are not satisfied with one lifetime.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
You want all lifetimes.

35
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,470
With the same guy!

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
That would be so boring.

37
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,160
Don’t you think so?

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
Take these chestnuts for example.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,470
However sweet and tasty they are,

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,070
you’d get tired of eating them one day.

41
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,520
You eat meals and drink water every day,

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,550
but are you tired of that?

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,960
The mutual love
starts sweet and romantic.

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,350
After the marriage life starts,

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,630
the real love can be felt
as time goes by,

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,350
like the spring water’s sweet taste.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,760
But I don’t know why

48
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,320
after we got married,

49
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,800
the feelings before... are gone.

50
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,520
That is normal

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,990
because they are two different persons.

52
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,470
Two persons?

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,350
I mean

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,800
when a man chases a girl,

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
he’s like a general on the battlefield.

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,430
After he marries the girl,

57
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,910
he takes off his armor and retires,

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
as if he were a different person.

59
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,160
So, they’re two different persons.

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
If I knew it,

61
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,040
I would get married later.

62
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,990
Looks like memories can deceive people,

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,760
but feelings can’t.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
I want to know

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,190
how it feels

66
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,960
when forgetting everything.

67
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,470
With nothing to care for,

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,070
it feels good.

69
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,190
It does?

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,270
If you’re interested,

71
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,190
I can give you a cup of the Lethe Tea.

72
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,800
No, no, no.

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,760
Everyone comes to me

74
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,630
for any confusion about the human world
or the Heavenly Palace.

75
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,470
If I forget everything,

76
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,960
how can I find out your past?

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
Thank you, sir.

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,310
You’re welcome.

79
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,380
(Chronology)
I can’t remember everything

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
over thousands of years.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
But I’m used to recording big events

82
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,590
in the Chronology.

83
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,280
I think I also recorded

84
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,120
what happened to you.

85
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,150
The Lonely Star left his post
without permission

86
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,680
and was dismissed
as the Heavenly General.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,150
One of his ribs was made into a pipa,

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
accompanying him all the time.

89
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,240
To repent of his fault,

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,190
he drank the Lethe Tea willingly,

91
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,870
forgot about everything

92
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,560
and guarded Luofeng Pavilion
for three thousand years.

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,630
Only one page?

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
Why did I leave my post
without permission?

95
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,870
That’s odd.

96
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,720
The details were gone.

97
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,840
Did anyone else check on it?

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,310
I don’t remember.

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
But considering your temper,

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
you wouldn’t leave your post
for no reason.

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,750
There must be something fishy

102
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,000
with what happened.

103
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,030
So, I’ll give you a firefly rain.

104
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,150
Where’s he?

105
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,150
I’m here alone?

106
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,840
Don’t go!

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,870
Don’t go!

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
You’re awake?

109
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,310
Why are you sweating?

110
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,030
Your hair’s wet.

111
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,030
You had a dream?

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,150
I dreamed about myself,

113
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,000
and someone else.

114
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,030
You dreamed of your husband?

115
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,910
Miss,

116
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,590
I found this paper dragon

117
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,190
in the room you lived in.

118
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Do you still want it?

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
It’s... it’s mine?

120
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,280
It’s not?

121
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,000
This paper dragon is unique.

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,000
I’m the only maker in the world.

123
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,560
I’ll ask someone else, then.

124
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,070
It’s mine.

125
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,960
I remember

126
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,590
I embroidered something.

127
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
Why can’t I find it?

128
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,910
Who gave it to me?

129
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,590
I think

130
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
I forgot something very important.

131
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,680
Don’t go!

132
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,350
What exactly did I forget

133
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,790
in this place?

134
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,470
Why can’t I remember at all?

135
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,950
Husband?

136
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,910
You’re my husband, aren’t you?

137
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,830
Why can’t I see you clearly?

138
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,350
I am.

139
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,590
But this is a mere dream.

140
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,390
You’re in a dream.

141
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Dream?

142
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,350
Can I feel

143
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,150
you haven’t changed

144
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,760
only when I’m in a dream?

145
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,950
I haven’t changed.

146
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,910
I know you haven’t.

147
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,710
The feeling that

148
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,390
only you’re by my side

149
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,560
hasn’t changed.

150
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,320
Now that I pledged to be yours,

151
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,000
I won’t ever change.

152
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,470
You’re always my Liuying.

153
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,880
Darling,

154
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,800
since we got married,

155
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,120
you’ve never talked to me like that.

156
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,000
I thought

157
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,800
you forgot how you called me before.

158
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,830
Liuying,

159
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,350
I would never forget.

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,760
I wish I couldn’t wake up.

192
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,680
♪I wanna stay with you in this life♪

193
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,510
I also want to exchange my power
over a thousand years

194
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,440
for the incessant dream.

195
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,800
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

196
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
(Xiahou’s Mansion)
Xu Zhiyuan’s wife Liuying

197
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,950
is virtuous, gorgeous,

198
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,440
intelligent,

199
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,680
-Xu Zhiyuan really
-and elegant.

200
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,560
became the No.1 scholar

201
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,710
and worked as a fifth-rank compiler
in Hanlin Academy.

202
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,640
-He even got Liuying mandated.
-Respect this.

203
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

204
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

205
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,560
-But since he became an official,
-I’m finished.

206
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,320
he’s been more serious.

207
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,560
He’s nice to Liuying, but...

208
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,350
How shall I put it?

209
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,080
They’re courteous to each other.

210
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,240
Luckily, they’re not cold to each other.

211
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,760
Being cold might be better.

212
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,070
Go!

213
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,130
Go. Be quick.

214
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,830
Lord Xiahou was reported

215
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,760
to keep closely touch
with Duke of the South.

216
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,240
(Xiahou’s Mansion)
His Majesty was furious

217
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,470
and ordered soldiers
to confiscate Xiahou’s Family.

218
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,120
(Xiahou’s Mansion)
We’re innocent! We’re innocent!

219
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,470
-Let go of me!
-Shut up!

220
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,590
-Let go of me!
-Go!

221
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,710
Only Xiahou Xue was saved

222
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,640
by Dragon King.

223
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,760
Have something to eat.

224
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,590
Why didn’t you save my parents?

225
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,320
My family was ruined overnight!

226
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,390
When I married you,

227
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,470
my families said you were a monster

228
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,710
and would bring misfortune to my family.

229
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,320
I didn’t believe them.

230
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,910
But it turned out to be true!

231
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,870
My family used to be in peace.

232
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,200
There wasn’t any disaster

233
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,870
until you came.

234
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,960
I was so stupid!

235
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,030
Why didn’t I listen to them?

236
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
Now it’s too late to regret!

237
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,510
Darling.

238
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,390
How are they?

239
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,440
Lord Xiahou is in prison.

240
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,870
Mrs. Xiahou...

241
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,870
I hear she’ll be exiled to the North.

242
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,230
My cousin is missing.

243
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,360
Why would this happen?

244
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,230
Could you save them?

245
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,630
The Xiahou Family is involved
in a rebellion case.

246
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,270
I don’t think...

247
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,480
But we can’t just watch and do nothing!

248
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Please do something, Darling.

249
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,360
Governor Liu of Hanlin Academy
is my teacher.

250
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,960
I’ll ask him privately.

251
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,910
Thank you.

252
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
I also worry about one thing.

253
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,320
I hear

254
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,320
my cousin’s husband isn’t a human,

255
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,150
but a dragon demon!

256
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,110
Maybe,

257
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,480
he has killed my cousin.

258
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,480
Dragon King would never kill Miss.

259
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,110
Everybody says that

260
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,200
the dragon demon brought the misfortune

261
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,840
to the Xiahou Family.

262
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,150
But Dragon King is a good man.

263
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,510
He’s very kind.

264
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,480
Even if no one else trusts him,

265
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,270
I do!

266
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,200
Liuying,

267
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,960
you’re the only one who trusts me.

268
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,840
My Lord.

269
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,990
Dragon King.

270
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,910
He sent you this letter,

271
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,270
saying it will vindicate Lord Xiahou!

272
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,820
(Lord Xiahou isn’t involved
in the rebellion of Duke of the South.)

273
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
What do you think?

274
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,270
With this,

275
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,680
the problem will be solved.

276
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,600
The Xiahou Family were freed
from being executed.

277
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,840
But you broke heavenly laws

278
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,800
when you interfered
with the human world.

279
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,270
When you don’t tell others,

280
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,630
how will they know?

281
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,200
You and Xiahou Xue are a couple
in the name only,

282
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,150
but you’re not a real couple.

283
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,840
You faked a human body
with branches and leaves,

284
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,680
pretending to be her husband.

285
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
I’m afraid

286
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,990
you broke the promise between you
and Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

287
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,080
I don’t love Xiahou Xue.

288
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,360
All I can do is to keep her safe.

289
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,750
I can give her nothing more.

290
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,030
After practicing for a thousand years,

291
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,870
you’re trapped in love.

292
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,270
I’m afraid

293
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,750
you can’t get away
from the love tribulation.

294
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,720
If loving her is my tribulation,

295
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,440
I’m glad to accept it.

296
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,030
Drink less.

297
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,910
It’s the Strongest Spirit.

298
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,480
All I want is to get drunk.

299
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,270
Dragon King!

300
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,800
Hello, sir.

301
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,750
Liuying felt a bit sick the other day.

302
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,750
Today, the doctor checked on her

303
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,910
and she’s been pregnant for two months.

304
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Dragon King!

305
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,560
Since when were you so close to him?

306
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,080
You don’t even have time

307
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,270
to remove the Meteor mark
on your forehead, right?

308
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,990
Don’t bring it up.

309
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,230
To remove it,

310
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,600
I even went to Luofeng Pavilion
to steal pipa. I...

311
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,600
I...

312
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,110
I suffered quite a lot!

313
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,320
You met Xue Qianxun?

314
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,680
Don’t bring him up.

315
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,080
Don’t! Don’t do that!

316
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,480
I can’t hear his name.

317
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,030
He’s an evil man!

318
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,630
I have something else to do.

319
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,720
I’m leaving.

320
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,180
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

321
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,680
Darling,

322
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,270
I brought you

323
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,080
your favorite Crispy Durian Cake.

324
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Thank you, Darling.

325
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,510
Darling,

326
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,990
hope we’ll have a son.

327
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,030
I never knew

328
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,320
my life could be so long,

329
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,910
just like a chronic torture.

330
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,320
I saw you marry someone else,

331
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,630
get pregnant and have babies.

332
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,150
Try some, Darling.

333
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Is it delicious?

334
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,910
I had thought
as long as you lived a happy life,

335
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,440
I would be relieved

336
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,480
and wait patiently to meet you again

337
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,030
after everything ended.

338
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,270
Unexpectedly,

339
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,200
even the thunder strike

340
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,200
wasn’t as tough as this moment.

341
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,390
I don’t know

342
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,320
when we can complete our promise.

343
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,440
I’ve something else to do.

344
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,910
Go to bed early.

345
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,100
(Luofeng Pavilion)

346
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,960
My Lord,

347
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,600
you can no longer
repair the crack of sky net

348
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,200
with your own power.

349
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,630
Then will I let the demons escape
from the sky net?

350
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,560
Liuying is pregnant.

351
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,440
Her husband is working in another town

352
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,230
and can’t protect her.

353
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,990
If she has a difficult labor...

354
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,560
She can’t drink any ginseng soup.

355
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,840
My Lady, please wake up!

356
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
If she can’t wake up,

357
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,720
I’m afraid she or her baby
might be in danger.

358
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,750
Lord Xu is away from home.

359
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,360
She’s giving birth right away.

360
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,230
Will we save her or her baby?

361
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,150
Bah!

362
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,320
Leave us!

363
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,800
All of you, leave!

364
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,080
Go!

365
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Liuying,

366
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,630
don’t be asleep.

367
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,630
Did she pass out

368
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,910
because of insufficient strength?

369
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,030
It hurts!

370
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,910
It hurts!

371
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
You can’t keep protecting her soul

372
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,110
with your power.

373
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,320
You’ll run out of power sooner or later.

374
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,800
What do we do?

375
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,680
There’s strong spirit

376
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,560
in this room.

377
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,230
She shouldn’t have a difficult labor.

378
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,480
Is Luofeng Pavilion making trouble?

379
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,230
Luofeng Pavilion?

380
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,460
(Luofeng Pavilion)

381
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,680
Someone’s really making trouble.

382
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
I must send my doppelganger there.

383
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,030
Dragon King,

384
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,600
when you make a doppelganger,
your power will drop greatly!

385
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,230
If you’re hurt,
your soul will be hurt, too!

386
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,510
I can be hurt,

387
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,910
but Liuying can’t die.

388
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
It’s about time.

389
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,360
The soul is in the Lotus Box.

390
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,440
Bingxing, you don’t open it?

391
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,630
There’s no hurry.

392
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,680
When the woman loses all her blood,

393
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,990
messenger of Luofeng Pavilion
will tell me.

394
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,440
Then I’ll open the Lotus Box.

395
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,840
Yuchi Longyan, how dare you break in!

396
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,080
Give me her soul!

397
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,860
(Luofeng Pavilion)

398
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,140
(Luofeng Pavilion)

399
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,540
(Luofeng Pavilion)

400
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Liuying,

401
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
you’re safe now.

402
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
You keep interfering
with Luofeng Pavilion,

403
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,990
we won’t let you go!

404
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,600
Your soul was hurt
when you forced a doppelganger.

405
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
(Luofeng Pavilion)
You risked your life to protect Liuying.

406
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,630
It’s...

407
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,480
It’s love?

408
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,440
What’s the value of it?

409
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,870
If you break off love
and never remember,

410
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
that’s your luck,

411
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,630
but also your loss.

412
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,390
Break off love and never remember?

413
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,680
(Luofeng Pavilion)

414
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,630
Let him go.

415
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
I’m sorry I failed it.

416
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,960
I’m sure

417
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
Qingqing told Yuchi Longyan about it.

418
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,630
I’m going to kill her immediately

419
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,080
to avoid future troubles!

420
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,230
Without my permission,

421
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,840
no one shall hurt her!

422
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,030
Yes.

423
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
She’s safe at last.

424
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,440
Dragon King,

425
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,600
Liuying’s exhausted.

426
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,230
She’ll be alright after some rest.

427
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,840
You’re leaving?

428
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,480
You don’t wait until she wakes up?

429
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,080
Look at you two.

430
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,680
He loves you,

431
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,390
and you love him.

432
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,080
But you can’t be together.

433
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,750
How unreasonable it is!

434
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,960
Silk fabrics from the Western Regions?

435
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,270
Fur from the East?

436
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,480
And these...

437
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,200
Bean paste cake, osmanthus cake,
and chestnut cake.

438
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,720
Dragon King, I used to think

439
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,270
it’s hard to get along with you

440
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,870
or get close to you.

441
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,150
But now I realize

442
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,200
you’re so considerate.

443
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,510
Don’t only notice the food or clothing.

444
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,110
The medical herbs
are the most precious.

445
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,560
I really admire you!

446
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,560
You’re a model of immortals and men.

447
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,150
It must be true love.

448
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
I admire you.

449
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,200
I’ll leave them to you, then.

450
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,630
Dragon King is such a good man.

451
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,440
Looks like the punishment of singing
isn’t enough for you.

452
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,990
Let go of me! Let go of me!

453
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,150
Yuchi Longyan can touch you,

454
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,230
but I can’t?

455
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,110
I won’t run, all right?

456
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,840
Let go of me first.

457
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,800
What’s your relationship
with Yuchi Longyan?

458
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,630
We’re in no relationship!

459
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,990
We’re simply friends.

460
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,360
Good friends.

461
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,750
If you were simply friends,

462
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,750
why did he give you so many treasures?

463
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,200
Why does a bird like you need this?

464
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,800
He’s just generous.

465
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,560
-It hurts!
-Generous?

466
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,030
Don’t I have these

467
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,200
in Luofeng Pavilion?

468
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,470
You’re my maid.

469
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,950
Your belongings

470
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,510
