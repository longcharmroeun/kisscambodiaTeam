17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,710
Mr. Lu. Well…

18
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,280
Thank you.

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,840
General, have some as well.

20
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,190
You’re not thinking of pursuing
the retreating enemy, are you?

21
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,160
Yes, I am.

22
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
Report!

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,760
General Feng. General Zhao.

24
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,710
Mr. Lu.

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
There is a letter asking for meeting.

26
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,120
Let me read it.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
What’s the letter about?

28
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,070
The Imperial Advisor of Dongluo

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,680
asked for a meeting to make peace.

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,630
Well…

31
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,400
The war will be over?

32
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,830
The King of Dongluo

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
must be upset that his son got hurt.

34
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,350
Let him in.

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,710
-Hurry up.
-Yes.

36
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,270
Father.

37
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,630
Today, I’ve finally

38
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,990
beaten back the invader Dongluo

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,960
and accomplished your
long-cherished wish.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
You can

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,620
rest in peace now.

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,740
(Deceased Father Feng Se’s Tablet)

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,270
Soldiers.

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,320
There can’t be peaceful borders

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,190
without your sacrifices.

46
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,430
I want to

47
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
thank you on behalf of our fellows.

48
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,760
The war

49
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,270
is finally over.

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,280
She got one of my eyes blind.

51
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,910
But I’m ordered to make peace.

52
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,960
Father

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,150
is just trampling

54
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
on my dignity.

55
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,520
Am I so worthless

56
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,150
in his mind?

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,520
Your Highness,

58
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,070
I know you’re angry.

59
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,310
But His Majesty did this
for the whole situation.

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
We can wait for a few more years

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,350
until you ascend the throne, then…

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Ascend the throne?

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,590
How long do you think that old jerk

64
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,070
can keep me as the Crown Prince?

65
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,560
I don’t have much time.

66
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,120
My fate is in my hand,

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,680
not the heaven’s.

68
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,470
Jin.

69
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,520
I must

71
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,400
take this revenge.

72
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,870
I’ll go kill her right now.

73
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,870
No.

74
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Touch it.

75
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,870
I want her to feel my pain.

76
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,400
I want her to wish she were dead.

77
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,280
I’m leaving, Your Highness.

78
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,070
Your Highness.

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,030
Refill it.

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,470
Young man,

81
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,400
what medicine did you use?

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,840
I’ve been a physician for years

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,120
but never seen a wound
heal so quickly like this.

84
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,800
It’s just a small wound.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,190
Then, have enough rest.

86
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,310
Long Yan.

87
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,630
Do you feel better now?

88
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,590
Mr. Lu.

89
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,680
Don’t bother to do this.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,190
I came a long way from Wind City

91
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,680
with limited supplies.

92
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
This box of ginseng is a gift for you.

93
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
Thank you for saving General Feng.

94
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
It’s my duty to protect General.

95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,630
Long Yan,

96
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,190
I’m not being grateful
as the Military Supervisor,

97
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
but as a man.

98
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,870
Thank you for saving the most important

99
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,030
person in my life.

100
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,750
The most important person?

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,310
I like her.

102
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,840
Not only like that.

103
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,240
I will marry her one day.

104
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
We have been childhood sweethearts.

105
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
I have been loving her since

106
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,190
the first moment I saw her.

107
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,840
And I have never forgotten her
for so many years.

108
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,350
When I learned that she and her father

109
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,800
were guarding the border here,

110
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,590
I volunteered to serve
as the Military Supervisor here

111
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,910
after I became the Top Scholar,

112
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,590
to get close to her.

113
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,000
You gave up a better career

114
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,590
for General Feng.

115
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,840
I admire it.

116
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
Thank you, Long Yan.

117
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,870
Then, please accept

118
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,590
this box of ginseng.

119
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,590
Thanks for your efforts!

120
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,280
Let me propose a toast!

121
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,190
General Feng! General Feng!
General Feng!

122
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,400
Cheers!

123
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,150
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Enjoy your food!

125
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:55,950
General!

126
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,240
-Guys!
-General. General.

127
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,510
Thank you! Cheers!

128
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,390
-It’s what we should do.
-Thank you, General.

129
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
General is such a good drinker!

130
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,030
Have some more food!

131
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,590
-Sure.
-Thank you, General!

132
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,830
Come on, eat.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,350
-Thank you!
-General! General!

134
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,760
-Please don’t say that!
-Come on! Cheers!

135
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,030
Cheers!

136
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,030
Thank you, General!

137
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,440
-Come on!
-Come on! Cheers!

138
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,880
-Don’t drink too much! Let me.
-General!

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
-Come on! Cheers!
-Thank you, General!

140
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,090
General, cheers!

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
Have some more food!

142
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,560
Chenyue!

143
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,710
Look at Lu Zheng!

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,150
Doesn’t he know how to treat a girl
politely?

145
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,270
Chenyue!

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,320
General Feng is really…

147
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
-Did you see his hands?
-An excellent woman and a good drinker.

148
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,680
Look at him!

149
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,950
But, as the Military Supervisor,

150
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,150
I’ll drink for her from now on.

151
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,270
Come on! Cheers!

152
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,120
Cheers! Cheers!

153
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Together! Cheers!

154
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,440
Chenyue.

155
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,350
General Zhao,

156
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,800
does Mr. Lu

157
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,350
like our general?

158
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,000
Everyone can tell it.

159
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
Don’t say it out.

160
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
But,

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,150
Mr. Lu is well-educated while
General’s trained in military exercises.

162
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,000
I don’t think they are
right for each other.

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
You know what?

164
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,680
Our general is the chosen one

165
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,880
and one in a million.

166
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,270
And, Mr. Lu has

167
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,390
a good family background
and good character.

168
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,000
He looks weak, but he is still manly.

169
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,120
That’s enough. That’s a perfect match.

170
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,120
Then, are we going to have their
wedding feast soon?

171
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,710
Don’t talk nonsense!
General may hear you.

172
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I’m just worried for Mr. Lu.

173
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,710
General is hard to handle.

174
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,440
-Enough. Drink.
-Come on.

175
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,590
Come on, guys!

176
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
Drink some more! Cheers!

177
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,030
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
General is such a good drinker!

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,200
-Yes!
-She drinks like a fish!

180
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,950
Chenyue.

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Mr. Lu.

182
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,120
Zheng, you can also tame a horse?

183
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,910
I trained this wild horse

184
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,120
to give it to you.

185
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,120
It must have cost you

186
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
a lot of time to tame it.

187
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,240
You’re really going to give it to me?

188
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,270
We are so close now.

189
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,760
Just take it.

190
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,240
My horse is great.

191
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Why should I change it?

192
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,510
But, General,

193
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
this is a fine horse.

194
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,510
Look at it.
Its hair is black and bright.

195
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,350
And,

196
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,350
its hip. Look!

197
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,710
And its legs.
It’s definitely a fine horse!

198
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,710
Uncle Zhao, you like it?

199
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,470
I…

200
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,800
Since Uncle Zhao likes it,
you can give it to him.

201
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,910
Well… It’s…

202
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,350
It’s not appropriate.

203
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,640
General, it’s for you.

204
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,320
How could I take it?

205
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,240
Uncle Zhao, your horse

206
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,680
was given by my father.

207
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,240
It’s old now. You should change it.

208
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,320
Zheng, what do you think?

209
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,640
Alright. Alright.

210
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,680
Mr. Lu, thank you.

211
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,240
I’ll take it.

212
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,510
Chenyue.

213
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,760
Open it.

214
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,590
Nice bow.

215
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,880
The dragon’s head…

216
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,710
should be like this.

217
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,640
Chenyue.

218
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,080
Zheng, what’s the matter?

219
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,760
General!

220
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
Time for a facial!

221
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,950
Come here.

222
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,350
Zheng, let’s talk later.

223
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,800
I can’t stand Qingqing. See you!

224
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,440
Why are you running again?

225
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,510
Come back!

226
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,830
So, she likes dragons?

227
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,820
(Deceptions in War)

228
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,380
(An Evilly Charming Emperor’s Requite)

229
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Nice shot! Long Yan.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,710
Mr. Lu.

231
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,950
Don’t bother.

232
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,000
Long Yan, I have no friends

233
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,760
in the army.

234
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,590
But you and I feel like old friends.

235
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,270
Mr. Lu, I feel flattered.

236
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,640
You risked your life to save Chenyue.

237
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,240
I will never forget

238
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,880
your kindness.

239
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,800
It’s my duty to serve General.

240
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I also want to do many things for her.

241
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,030
I gave her fine horse, nice bow,

242
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,440
clothes and hats.

243
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,270
But she doesn’t like

244
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,150
or use any of them.

245
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,470
But lately,

246
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,950
I just found that she likes dragons.

247
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Dragons?

248
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,320
Yes.

249
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,150
You know,

250
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,150
dragons are not like lions or tigers.

251
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,710
If she likes those,

252
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,390
I can catch one for her.

253
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,440
Now I know that she likes dragons,

254
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,240
but I can’t bring her one.

255
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,350
Yes.

256
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,030
After all, dragons only fly in the sky.

257
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,030
I got an idea!

258
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,350
Great. Great.

259
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,560
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

260
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,000
We have won the war.

261
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,470
Then, Dongluo

262
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,560
will send their most beautiful
Princess Rui

263
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,390
to make peace by marriage.

264
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,510
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

265
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,440
Chenyue!

266
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,320
Look what I bring you for fun.

267
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Dragon kite!

268
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,680
You must want to see

269
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,640
the dragon fly in the sky.

270
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,950
How do you know that?

271
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,710
There are some things

272
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,880
you don’t need to say.

273
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,560
We have connection in minds.

274
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,560
Right?

275
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,080
Connection in minds?

276
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,680
I’m a boy and I’m older than you.

277
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,390
You should call me Zheng.

278
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,320
I’m Qingqing’s brother.

279
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,910
I’m Long Yuchi.

280
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,600
I can always find you

281
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,230
no matter where you are.

282
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
Is Zheng implying to me

283
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,150
that he is Dragon King?

284
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,510
But, why I feel…

285
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,560
Chenyue?

286
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,230
Come on, let’s go fly the kite.

287
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,030
Sure.

288
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,480
Take it.

289
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,720
Let’s go.

290
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,270
It’s flying!

291
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,200
Press down the string.

292
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,600
Here. Have a try.

293
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,390
No. Not like this.

294
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,960
Downward. Down.

295
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:44,990
Downward.

296
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,080
Yes. Right. Down.

297
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,270
That’s right.

298
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,560
Great.

299
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,390
Yes, it’s like this.

300
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,800
Yes. And pull it.

301
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,030
Look.

302
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,080
It’s flying higher!

303
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,080
Yes.

304
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,360
Young Master!

305
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,440
Chenyue, I have something to deal with.

306
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,270
I need to go now.

307
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,510
-I’ll be back later.
-Go now.

308
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,510
Look at you. Dragon?

309
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,200
It’s a dragon!

310
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,560
You! Come here!

311
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,230
Yes, General.

312
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,030
Take it.

313
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,800
Is it really you?

314
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,990
Why did the dragon appear

315
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
as soon as Zheng left?

316
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,360
Is that a hint to me?

317
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,510
But, why don’t you tell me?

318
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,150
Are you being shy?

319
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,720
Dragon King! Please show up!

320
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,480
I won’t laugh at you!

321
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,750
He said he would never be jealous.

322
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,840
But, look at him now!

323
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,910
He can’t be with Chenyue.

324
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,630
So, he can only watch her happy
with another man.

325
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,480
Look at him!

326
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,990
He is jealous of the fake dragon!

327
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,560
Look how he is flying!

328
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,030
Dragon King is just a Jealous King.

329
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,560
Jealous King! King of Jealousy!

330
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,680
Why is the laughter

331
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
in my head so familiar

332
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,840
but strange?

333
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,200
Who is that person?

334
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,360
So funny!

335
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,320
Zheng!

336
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,990
I’m here.

337
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,320
Yuchi.

338
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
What did you say?

339
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,750
Don’t be shy, Dragon King.

340
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,360
I know you are him!

341
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,360
What? Dragon King?

342
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,200
Do you have anything to do with
the rebel, Duke Long?

343
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,390
It’s a misunderstanding.

344
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,720
Don’t talk about it again.

345
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,990
It will be bad
if this goes to Wind City.

346
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,510
No more “King”,

347
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
no matter what it is.

348
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
-But Dragon…
-Don’t say it again.

349
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,320
Alright.

350
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,990
I’m sure that

351
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,030
Dragon King is by my side.

352
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,990
Who is he?

353
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,200
If he is not Zheng,

354
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,630
why did he give me the dragon kite?

355
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,510
Why did a dragon appear in the sky?

356
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,720
The Feng Army is heavily guarded and
it’s difficult to penetrate.

357
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,600
It’s not so easy to deal with
Feng Chenyue.

358
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,200
We have to bribe the officials
in Wind City

359
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,990
to let Feng Chenyue go back there
before we can do it.

360
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,990
Father has sent Rui for the marriage.

361
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,360
I got it.

362
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,560
I will accompany Princess

363
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,960
to Wind City.

364
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,630
Rui has always been timid.

365
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,030
I’ll ask her to listen to you this time.

366
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,320
I’ll let Feng Chenyue go back to
Wind City

367
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,870
and kill her then.

368
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,440
Wind City is so beautiful!

369
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,510
After we are settled,

370
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,750
I must come here and find

371
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,680
if there is any food from our hometown.

372
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
His Majesty specially prepared

373
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,510
this cozy Xilai Pavilion
for Your Highness.

374
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,720
We can tell how much His Majesty
loves Your Highness.

375
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,390
Your Highness.

376
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,840
Eunuch Li,

377
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,230
a little gift for you. Please accept it.

378
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,800
Your Highness,

379
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,390
just come to me anytime you like

380
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,680
if you need any help.

381
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,360
I’m leaving now.

382
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,800
You may leave as well.

383
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,320
They finally left.

384
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,510
Did I do anything wrong just now?

385
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,910
Your Highness have done a good job.

386
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,960
Then, what should I do next?

387
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,800
According to the royal palace etiquette,

388
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,990
Your Highness should have more contact

389
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,110
with the Queen Consort.

390
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,270
Then, will Feng Chenyue
come to Wind City?

391
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,960
She will come

392
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,320
if we want her to.

393
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,510
She will come

394
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,840
if we want her to?

395
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,600
Your Highness, please take an
early sleep after such a long journey.

396
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,390
What’s this?

397
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,200
It’s called labyrinth casket.

398
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,910
Labyrinth casket?

399
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,480
It looks interesting.

400
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,540
(Yue)

401
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,360
Order General Feng to come back
for reward?

402
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
Young as she is,

403
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,680
it’s not easy for her to be able to

404
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,870
beat back Dongluo.

405
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
Your Majesty,

406
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,270
it was not easy.

407
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,110
I also admire it.

408
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,870
But she may grow frivolous

409
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,910
for enjoying success when young.

410
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,990
Now she is the only one on the border

411
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,080
who dares to ignore the imperial court.

412
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,630
I believe General Feng is not that
kind of person.

413
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,110
Your Majesty, a field commander

414
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,750
always decides
even against the King’s orders.

415
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,270
In my opinion,

416
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,200
we can take this opportunity

417
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,750
to see whether the Feng Army

418
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,750
has become arrogant

419
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,750
or they are still loyal.

420
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,840
(Imperial Edict)
General Feng Chenyue defeated Dongluo.

421
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,360
His Majesty shows concern

422
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,960
and orders General Feng to go back
to Wind City within ten days

423
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,270
for reward. That’s all.

424
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,230
Thank His Majesty. I receive the order.

425
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,110
Congratulations, General Feng.

426
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,560
But, ten days is short.

427
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Please set off as soon as possible.

428
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,440
If there is any delay,

429
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,150
that’s against the imperial edict.

430
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,110
I see.

431
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,870
You have come a long way here.
Uncle Zhao.

432
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,630
Yes.

433
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,480
Take Eunuch for rest and food.

434
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,990
Please.

435
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,750
-General.
-Qingqing!

436
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,510
We can finally go back to Wind City!

437
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,320
What’s so good about Wind City?

438
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,960
I think it’s more free
and beautiful here.

439
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
Wind City is better of course.

440
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,480
Chenyue, you’ll be rewarded.

441
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,680
But you’re ordered to go back
within ten days.

442
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,030
The trip will be a torture.

443
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,720
There must be something fishy.

444
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,990
Don’t worry.

445
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,840
No matter how things change,

446
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,840
just roll with the punches.

447
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,340
(Xu’s Mansion)

448
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,870
I heard that His Majesty is calling
the female general, Feng Chenyue,

449
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,230
back to Wind City?

450
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,720
Feng Chenyue is like a queen
on the frontier.

451
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,270
All the soldiers there are
at her command.

452
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,030
She is really that capable?

453
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,800
The Former General Feng got his
daughter at an old age.

454
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,360
Of course the Feng Army

455
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,200
will all listen to her.

456
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,440
As a female official in Wind City,

457
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,870
she must obey the rules here.

458
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,600
I’ll find a chance

459
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,440
to teach her a lesson.

460
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,510
General.

461
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,150
You’re practicing
Xuantian Swordsmanship.

462
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,230
It’s famous for its speed.

463
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,910
I don’t know more than three people

464
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,630
in the world who can use it.

465
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,870
And it’s more difficult to master it.

466
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
I admire it.

467
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,320
I’m flattered.

468
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,030

485
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,440
You didn’t do it seriously.

486
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,990
I’m going back to Wind City.

487
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,750
How about you be my Chief Guard?

488
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,910
Thank you, General.

489
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,480
But, I think you don’t need

490
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,230
a soldier like me in Wind City.

491
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,080
You don’t have to answer me now.

492
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,870
We’ll set off tomorrow

493
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,800
and you can decide it then.

494
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,080
Chenyue.

495
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,960
I knew you were here.

496
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,030
Zheng.

497
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,440
Mr. Lu.

498
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,150
I have something to tell General.

499
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,960
Excuse me.

500
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,680
I didn’t finish my word just now.

501
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,150
Actually,

502
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,680
I got a secret letter from my father,

503
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,510
saying that some ministers

504
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,800
are discontented with your achievement.

505
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,110
He asked me to…

506
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
Keep your nose clean

507
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
and stay away from me?

508
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,510
Of course I’m not afraid of the gossip.

509
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,910
But, Chenyue,

510
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,030
you have to be careful in Wind City.

511
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,560
As the Military Supervisor,

512
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,110
I’m afraid I can’t go back with you.

513
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,990
Returning to Wind City is more
dangerous than a war?

514
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,800
Without people around to help,

515
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,030
you have to be more cautious.

516
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,910
I got it.

517
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,360
