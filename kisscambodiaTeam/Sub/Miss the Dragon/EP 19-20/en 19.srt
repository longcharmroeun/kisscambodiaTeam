Yuchi!

Yuchi!

19
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
Why can’t I see Dragon King’s

20
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,270
face clearly in my every dream?

21
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,600
Or, does it want to tell me

22
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,350
that Yuchi won’t come to me

23
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,470
but I have to go to find him?

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,070
General!

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
Come in.

26
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,880
General, bad news!

27
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,470
Dongluo is going to sneak up on us!

28
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,400
What?

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Our scout reported that

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,880
in order not to leak their trace,

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,400
they destroyed five villages

32
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,190
and left no one alive,

33
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,600
even newborn babies.

34
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,800
Zhong Sheng was patrolling the border.

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,270
Unfortunately, they killed him.

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,430
Who is their leader?

37
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,990
You were right.

38
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,600
Our scout said it’s
Dongluo’s Crown Prince.

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Han Xiyun!

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Gather up for battle!

41
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,120
Yes, General!

42
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,400
Dongluo has come again and again

43
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,190
to invade our homeland
and hurt our people!

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,120
Today, let those beasts from Dongluo

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,990
regret stepping into our land!

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
Soldiers!

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,960
Live for war! Die for war!

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,910
Together! We’ll kill all the invaders!

49
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,120
Live for war! Die for war!

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,470
Together! We’ll kill all the invaders!

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,320
Drive these jerks back to Dongluo!

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,120
Kill! Kill! Kill!

53
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,550
General!

54
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,240
Mr. Lu, what’s wrong?

55
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,760
Night attack is dangerous.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,070
You shouldn’t go.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,680
I can’t escape just because I’m afraid.

58
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,070
That’s not what a general should do.

59
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,550
Just because you’re the general,

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,000
you should know that

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,910
an army can’t be without a general.

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
If something bad happens to you,

63
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,590
who will be in command of our army?

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
You make sense.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,030
General, so you’ve decided not to join

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,310
the night attack?

67
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
You won’t join.

68
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,150
Me?

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,960
But, General…

70
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,840
Uncle Zhao,

71
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,680
I’ll leave the camp to you.

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,560
Soldiers! Let’s go!

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,910
Yes, General!

74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Report!

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,960
Your Highness,

76
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,870
we encountered a surprise attack
in the rear by the Feng Army.

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,030
They are quick on their feet.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,720
How is the situation?

79
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,680
Not too many injuries and deaths.

80
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,800
But most of our catapults

81
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,870
were burnt.

82
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,470
I’m afraid our plan…

83
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,350
Such a clean action.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,590
It must be Feng Chenyue.

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,310
She just rushed right into the trap.

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Give my order.
Kill all the sneak attackers.

87
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
No one should be left alive.

88
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,240
Tonight,

89
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
I want her head to be my bowl for wine.

90
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,750
Yes, Your Highness.

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,350
Han Xiyun!

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Bow and arrow!

93
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,280
General Feng,

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
it’s been a while.

95
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,560
You’ve got good Kung Fu!

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,510
Which squad do you belong to?
What’s your name?

97
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,560
Fight!

98
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,470
What are you waiting for? Chase them!

99
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,560
Yes, Your Highness!

100
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,030
Kill them with the crossbow!

101
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

102
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,440
Carry your shields on your backs!

103
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,000
-Yes!
-Yes!

104
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,080
Hurry up!

105
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,270
Get up!

106
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,830
I ask you to send troops to the rescue!

107
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,640
No!

108
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
-General gave the order…
-You!

109
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,710
Mr. Lu, please let me explain.

110
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,320
I know you’re worried about General.

111
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,950
So am I.

112
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,590
But General gave the order

113
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,470
before she left for the night attack

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
that we can’t dispatch troops

115
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,440
until we receive their distress signal.
It can’t be disobeyed!

116
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,320
Alright,

117
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,120
seems that you’re pretty loyal
to General Feng.

118
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Mr. Lu, we are Feng Army.

119
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,880
I have only one big brother in my life.

120
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
Without him, I wouldn’t have been here.

121
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,120
You’ve never seen
how General usually is.

122
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,760
So combative and majestic-looking.

123
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,120
Just like my big brother.

124
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,510
Of course I’m loyal to her.

125
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,080
I’ll take that as a compliment.

126
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,390
-General!
-You’re back!

127
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,640
Are you all right?

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,710
Can’t be better.

129
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,640
How was it?

130
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,440
We are slightly damaged.

131
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,000
But overall the attack was a success.

132
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,120
Dongluo Army turned and retreated.

133
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,710
Then we still need to take precautions.

134
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,470
They will turn on us at any moment.

135
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,440
We need to be on guard.

136
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,640
No, I propose to strike at dawn.

137
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,760
We should counter attack

138
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,560
and burn all their food and horses,

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,950
so that they can’t invade

140
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,270
again for now.

141
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,240
I agree.

142
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,950
Zheng, you have the same idea with me.

143
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,440
It seems that we are
on the same wavelength.

144
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,150
Then, now we…

145
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
To counter attack,
I want to go with you.

146
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,270
Uncle Zhao and I
each lead a group of troops.

147
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,560
You need to take care of the camp.

148
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,800
Alright. Chenyue…

149
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,680
No. General.

150
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
Uncle Zhao, let’s go out
and discuss the formation.

151
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,000
OK.

152
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,440
By the way,

153
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,150
there is a soldier with great Kung Fu.

154
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,510
He must be better than me.

155
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,830
Do you know who he is?

156
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,830
A soldier

157
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
has better Kung Fu than you?

158
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,240
No way. I won’t believe it.

159
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,710
You know what?

160
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,270
It was so amazing.

161
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,320
Dongluo’s catapults

162
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,680
were so close to me.

163
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,470
But not even a single arrow hit me.

164
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
Given their poor skill,

165
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
they should practice more.

166
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,510
General, you’re the strongest.

167
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,270
Let me take the water out for you.

168
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,760
How could you be that lucky?

169
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,470
It must be Dragon King’s help.

170
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,560
By rights,

171
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,150
I should have been shot by one
or two arrows at least.

172
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,910
Were you secretly helping me?

173
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,710
Are you

174
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,800
hiding around me?

175
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,950
Why does the feeling

176
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,240
of flying feel so familiar?

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey, you!

178
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,640
Are you goofing off here?

179
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,320
Hurry to prepare the food cart! Move!

180
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Be quick!

181
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,350
You will all get punished if there is

182
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
any delay in preparing
rations and forage!

183
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,470
Miss Qingqing.

184
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,000
You’re the Dragon King!

185
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,270
But now you’re a soldier serving here.

186
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,710
It will definitely scare him
if you tell him who you are.

187
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,680
They won’t know who I am,

188
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,200
especially Chenyue.

189
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,150
I hope that

190
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,030
we will only be strangers in this life.

191
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,950
Why?

192
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,640
I helped her to become Concubine Yu

193
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,000
through the rain in her last life.

194
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,000
Although she got a wealthy life,

195
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,270
her life ended miserably

196
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
because of missing me.

197
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,880
I don’t want such a thing
to happen again.

198
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,470
So, this time,

199
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,950
I just want to be a soldier

200
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,510
and protect her secretly by her side.

201
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,470
But, what if she falls in love

202
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,510
with someone else?

203
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,560
It’s fine as long as she is happy.

204
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,240
If I were her,

205
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,150
I’d choose a tall,

206
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,240
handsome and rich guy

207
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,640
who has no parents, brothers or sisters.

208
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,510
He is cold to everyone else

209
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,760
but only sweet and nice to me.

210
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,440
Are you talking about Xue Qianxun?

211
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,800
No way!

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,830
How could it be him?

213
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,640
Cold to everyone else

214
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,910
but only sweet and nice to me.

215
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,710
How could it be Xue Qianxun?

216
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,590
Right?

217
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,270
Not him.

218
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,560
It’s me.

219
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,640
Did you interfere in

220
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,240
human affairs with your power again?

221
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,560
Will you be punished
by the thunder again?

222
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,710
Thunder?

223
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,390
It’s just like scratching an itch.

224
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,390
Where are you going?

225
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,200
Take this elixir first.

226
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,080
You are the proudest Dragon King.

227
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,080
But you’re willing to be punished for
protecting that girl.

228
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,270
Look at how painful you are.

229
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,910
Why bother?

230
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,600
I don’t feel painful.

231
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,080
On the battle field,

232
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,630
death is a common practice.

233
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,200
Even if she dies in battle,

234
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,150
she will go to her next life.

235
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,110
Why bother to help her

236
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,990
again and again?

237
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,320
Isn’t it better to be together
with her earlier?

238
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,750
Do you know what love is?

239
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,960
Love?

240
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,390
I used to think that

241
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,390
love was as romantic as it was

242
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,720
in those stories.

243
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
But after I experienced it, I found that

244
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,750
it’s more than that.

245
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,440
Then, explain it to me.

246
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,600
Love is not icing on the cake,

247
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,440
but sharing weal and woe.

248
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,510
It’s not selfish possession,

249
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
but long-term protection.

250
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,390
Liuying and Ayu
never had any aspiration,

251
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,870
but Chenyue has.

252
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,200
So, I must help her
to realize her aspiration

253
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,870
and let her live happily

254
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,440
in this life.

255
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,110
I can’t win in arguing with you.

256
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,600
Anyway, take care of yourself.

257
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,480
The elixir just now can let you recover.

258
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,910
But if you use your power

259
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,440
within the next 49 days,

260
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,960
you’ll get hurt.

261
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,230
And,

262
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,800
when you’re lack of energy,

263
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,990
you can’t use your power.

264
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,750
Why didn’t you tell me?

265
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,150
If you hadn’t had it,

266
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,840
how could you still stand here?

267
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,080
Can you be grateful?

268
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,680
Will Chenyue be in danger?

269
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,230
Rest assured.

270
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
She has the Soul of General
to protect her.

271
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,390
Alright.

272
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,680
That’s good.

273
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,630
I’m so kind to you.

274
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,390
Shouldn’t you say something to me?

275
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,150
I keep what I owe you in mind.

276
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,080
I’ll pay you back in the future.

277
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,870
Your Highness, the enemy raided us

278
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,840
and burnt our barns and stables.

279
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,200
Let me use your knife.

280
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,200
Your Highness.

281
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,960
What are you doing here

282
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,150
instead of rescuing the provisions?

283
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,510
Feng Chenyue is coming with her troops.

284
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,680
I’m here to protect Your Highness.

285
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,560
I don’t need your protection!

286
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,960
Now get out to do what you should do!

287
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,440
Yes.

288
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,110
I’m waiting here for Feng Chenyue

289
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,720
to bring me her head.

290
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,800
I’m leaving.

291
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
I don’t know why,

292
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,110
but I just feel she is coming.

293
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,750
Look! We were just talking about you!

294
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,630
Give me

295
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,630
your head.

296
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,840
Kill!

297
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,440
Don’t move!

298
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,840
Order them to put down their weapons.

299
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,720
Weapons down.

300
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,200
Weapons down!

301
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,560
You will have to pay for your cruelty!

302
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,680
General Feng, you know I’m the
Crown Prince of Dongluo.

303
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,680
I’ve heard
that you don’t like slaughter.

304
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,150
I always hate wars.

305
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,360
But I have no other choices to do this.

306
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,080
It’s of no use if you capture me.

307
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,910
There is never an end of taking revenge.

308
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,990
In the end,
it’ll be the brotherly people

309
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,230
of the countries who suffer.

310
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
If I can go back,

311
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,030
I’ll try my best to persuade my father
to withdraw,

312
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,110
so that we can build our friendship.

313
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,750
You think I can let you go

314
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,480
only for your words?

315
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,080
I’m not that easy to cheat.

316
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,960
I didn’t mean that.

317
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,440
A promise is a promise.

318
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,630
I promise that from now on,
our two countries

319
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,080
will remain brotherhood

320
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,030
and peace for a hundred years.

321
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,480
Brotherhood and peace
for a hundred years!

322
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,030
Brotherhood and peace
for a hundred years!

323
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:28,510
Brotherhood and peace
for a hundred years!

324
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,230
Brotherhood…

325
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,510
In this case,

326
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,990
don’t rush to go now.

327
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,630
Come with me to our camp

328
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,480
to discuss the details of the
peace negotiations.

329
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,230
General Feng, please lead the way.

330
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,360
My eye!

331
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,150
Kill her!

332
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,270
Kill them!

333
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,080
Bros! Withdraw!

334
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,390
Catapults!

335
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,270
Again!

336
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,750
But if you use your power

337
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,030
within the next 49 days,

338
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,680
you’ll get hurt.

339
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,030
Kill!

340
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,320
Protect General to withdraw!

341
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,360
General! Go!

342
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,200
Let’s go!

343
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,200
The soldier I mentioned is him.

344
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,080
He blocked the arrow for me.

345
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,750
In last battle,

346
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,320
it was also him who covered us

347
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,440
to make us able to retreat.

348
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
I have an impression of him.

349
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,270
But I’ve never heard that

350
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,560
he has great Kung Fu.

351
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,390
A master always hides in the crowd.

352
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,200
The one who keeps low-profile
is the real master.

353
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,680
Bro,

354
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,840
thank you.

355
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,630
Chenyue!

356
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,320
Mr. Lu.

357
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,480
I heard you got hurt?

358
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,150
Where? Let me have a check.

359
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,750
Zheng, I didn’t get hurt.

360
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,870
It’s him.

361
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,600
He blocked an arrow for me.

362
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,360
Thanks for his sacrifice.

363
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,390
He deserves award for his
service to General.

364
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,320
Mr. Lu, don’t worry about this.

365
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,630
Our general will never treat

366
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,360
a meritorious soldier ungenerously.

367
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,960
Now he is already the Brave Sergeant.

368
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,840
General Zhao,

369
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,510
I asked them
to make some nourishing soup.

370
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Go and have some, please.

371
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,560
Since you said that,

372
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,230
I do feel a little hungry.

373
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,480
Come on, let’s go together.

374
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,600
Mr. Lu, please.

375
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,270
Alright, let’s go have some together.

376
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,110
Come on.

377
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,230
“Zheng?”

378
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,630
That sounds pretty close.

379
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,840
When will my eye be cured?

380
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,870
Well…

381
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,270
Well…

382
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,270
I’m waiting for your answer!

383
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,600
I’m afraid your eye…

384
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,680
can’t be cured.

385
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,870
Really?

386
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,870
That means

387
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,960
your medical skills are not good enough.

388
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,440
That means…

389
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,110
You’re a quack!

390
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,110
Your Highness.

391
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,360
The Imperial Advisor is here.

392
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,480
You can leave now.

393
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,150
Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Your Highness.

395
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,030
Mr. Advisor, why do you suddenly
come to the army?

396
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,440
Your Highness,

397
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,150
I heard your eye got hurt.

398
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,110
You’d better go back for treatment.

399
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,870
Thanks for your concern.

400
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,110
But I can’t go back

401
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,870
before I win.

402
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,630
What if His Majesty wants you to?

403
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,600
Does my father know

404
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,320
that my eye got hurt?

405
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
His Majesty knows it.

406
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,200
I haven’t avenged yet,

407
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,630
but he asks me to retreat now?

408
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,150
Even if Your Highness’s not in the army,

409
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,270
we are still here.

410
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,320
We’ll fight till the end!

411
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
His Majesty ordered that

412
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,030
anyone who dares to start a battle
without his order

413
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,200
will be executed right away.

414
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,150
If I guessed it right,

415
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,840
father wants me to

416
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,360
submit to humiliation.

417
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,630
I understand that you feel unfair.

418
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,600
But you are the fiercest warrior
of Dongluo.

419
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,390
You got an eye hurt,

420
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,200
but the army suffered
heavier casualties.

421
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,600
The morale of the army is affected.

422
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,560
And most of the food were burnt.

423
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,910
We have lost the certainty of victory.

424
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,870
His Majesty asked me to remind you

425
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,270
to take the people of Dongluo
into consideration.

426
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,150
Looks like father has made up his mind.

427
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,200
Then, that’s it.

428
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,600
Mr. Lu.

429
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,270
Well…

430
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,480
Thank you.

431
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,960
General, have some as well.

432
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,360
You’re not thinking of pursuing
the retreating enemy, are you?

433
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,230
Yes, I am.

434
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,270
Report!

435
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,960
General Feng. General Zhao.

436
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,870
Mr. Lu.

437
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,150
There is a letter asking for meeting.

438
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,230
Let me read it.

439
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,510
