17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,480
She’s hugging me?

18
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,880
So heavy.

19
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,190
How come I was in bed

20
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,160
and slept with Xiaobai?

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,710
Luckily it didn’t bite me.

22
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,270
Why do I feel like

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,470
I slept better than before?

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,550
I didn’t sleep well.

25
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,500
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

26
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,880
How does a snake from the north

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,680
love durian from the Southeast Asia?

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,630
Xiaobai.

29
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,910
Do you even know that

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,350
people are laughing about my cravings?

31
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,990
They say I’m possessed by pig demon.

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,680
This smell again!

33
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,070
She must have given me

34
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,470
her favorite food.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
I have to push myself to eat it.

36
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,910
I didn’t expect such awful food

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,600
in the human world.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,680
So weird.

39
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,160
Can you not eat so much?

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,190
Why can’t you eat less? You!

41
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,270
You had them all again!

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,070
That’s durian from the Southeast Asia.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
It’s expensive.

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,710
Whatever.

45
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,550
Why talk about restraint with a snake?

46
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,240
That’s not for you.

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,320
Come here. Let me check your wound.

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,070
It’s a quick recovery.

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,310
Xiaobai.

50
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,910
You need to get well.

51
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,800
Then you’ll be a healthy snake soon.

52
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,120
Blue Bird.

53
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,120
How do you know

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,840
I prepared osmanthus cakes for you?

55
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,310
Blue Bird.

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,960
It’s strange.

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
Why doesn’t it eat

58
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,310
its favorite osmanthus cake?

59
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,150
Qingqing.

60
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,350
Where are osmanthus cakes?

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,470
No.

62
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,470
No osmanthus cake, almond cake,

63
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,400
kidney bean cake or lotus power cake.

64
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,190
Not a single cake.

65
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,030
Why?

66
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,800
Didn’t you say you’ll bring more cakes?

67
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,470
I didn’t have time for cakes.

68
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,150
(Qingqing)

69
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,470
I just saw a snake demon.

70
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,310
A snake demon?

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
No, no, no.

72
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,350
I think that’s a serpent.

73
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
A serpent?

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,150
Or it could be

75
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,070
a dragon demon.

76
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,400
Oh, yes. It must be a dragon demon.

77
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,280
A dragon demon?

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
Qingqing, let’s leave now.

79
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,150
It’s fine, he’s not here.

80
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,120
I am lucky that I didn’t

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,310
become his bird cake.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,150
Thank goodness. I was so scared.

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,350
How could a dragon demon show up in
Xiahou’s Mansion?

84
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,440
Right. How could it be?

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Could it be the demon

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,280
was attracted by Liuying’s sweet scent

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
and wanted to eat her?

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,120
My goodness!

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,350
My savior is going to be

90
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,800
eaten by the dragon demon.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
What can we do, Qingqing?

92
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,440
We won’t have cakes any more.

93
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,350
Xiaobai.

94
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,440
You’re fully recovered.

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,400
I’ll let you go back to the mountain.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,310
Well, are you happy about it?

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,440
Finally, no awful cakes!

98
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,070
I treated you nicely these days.

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,800
Will you miss me after you go back?

100
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,630
I will miss you.

101
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
It feels

102
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,680
so soft.

103
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,840
Roasted chestnuts.

104
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
What?

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,960
Roasted chestnuts.

106
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,440
What’s this?

107
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,640
Roasted chestnuts.

108
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,080
They smell so good.

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,320
I dreamed of them yesterday.

110
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
Now they’re on my table.

111
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,880
It must be a kind-hearted God

112
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,510
who has heard my wish.

113
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
I haven’t met you.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,710
But you must be

115
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,800
handsome and good-looking.

116
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,320
Thank you for giving me chestnuts.

117
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,000
No.

118
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,760
How could any God have time

119
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
to send me chestnuts?

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,640
It must be from Miss Xiahou.

121
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,880
In this world,

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,590
only she knows

123
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,590
roasted chestnuts are my favorite.

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,510
Xiaobai, you’re so lucky.

125
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,080
Before you go back to the mountain,

126
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Miss Xiahou bought chestnuts for me.

127
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,710
They are

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,710
big, fragrant and sweet.

129
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,710
So tasty.

130
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,150
Let me give you some.

131
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,150
Xiaobai.

132
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,390
Xiaobai.

133
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,640
Where is it?

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,320
Damn!

135
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,910
Could it be made into snake soup?

136
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,080
Xiaobai.

137
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
Xiaobai.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
Xiaobai.

139
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,270
Not in the kitchen or the garden.

140
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,270
Maybe it has left alone.

141
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,640
It has no sense of rapport at all.

142
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,350
I took care of you for so long.

143
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,080
And you just left like this?

144
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,950
Why can’t you

145
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,320
wait for another day?

146
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,470
I asked people to buy durian

147
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,270
so I can make candies for you.

148
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,760
Xiaobai.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,350
You are here!

150
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,320
I thought

151
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,640
you were steamed, fried,

152
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,030
stewed, cooked and eaten.

153
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,000
Why is she so scared?

154
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,470
You often turn into a human shape,

155
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,910
but forget to wear clothes.

156
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,510
This is quite inappropriate.

157
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,680
If I were a girl,

158
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,270
I would be freaked out.

159
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
Don’t be afraid.

160
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,350
I am Xiaobai.

161
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,950
Xiaobai?

162
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,800
You should call me Dragon King.

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,640
Are you the little white snake

164
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,200
that I saved?

165
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,270
I’m not a snake.

166
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,390
I am Dragon King.

167
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,080
Weren’t you looking for me?

168
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,510
Why are you afraid

169
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,000
after I show up?

170
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,270
But… You…

171
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,590
You fed me steamed eggs and durian.

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,910
I remember it all.

173
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Oh right,

174
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,910
roasted chestnuts too.

175
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,710
Did you buy the chestnuts?

176
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,800
Of course.

177
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,320
It’s really you.

178
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,710
Anyway you saved my life,

179
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,800
I’ll do everything to return your favor.

180
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Tell me

181
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,390
anything that you want.

182
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,830
Anything you name

183
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,240
in the three realms.

184
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,560
I don’t need anything.

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,590
It’s good to know you’re fine.

186
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,320
I didn’t cure you
for anything in return.

187
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,270
It was your honor

188
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,560
to heal my wound.

189
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,710
But I don’t want to

190
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,150
accept favors.

191
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,510
Tell me how to pay it back.

192
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,510
I don’t need anything.

193
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,390
There’s one thing.

194
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,950
If you really want to pay me back,

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,320
can you get away

196
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,120
the durian I bought?

197
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,200
I don’t really like that smell.

198
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,880
Didn’t you give it to me

199
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
because that’s your favorite?

200
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,710
You like it.

201
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,470
I bought it for you.

202
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,350
So you bought it just for me?

203
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Yeah, with my monthly salary.

204
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,950
It’s expensive.

205
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Why didn’t you ask me if I like it?

206
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,880
This…

207
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,200
Well…

208
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,390
Who knows a snake can speak?

209
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,760
Liuying, Liuying, where are you?

210
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,560
I’m here.

211
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,470
Miss Xiahou is looking for you.

212
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,150
Remember to get away the durian.

213
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,440
I have to go.

214
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,760
What are you thinking about?

215
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Why are you here?

216
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,910
The third tribulation is coming.

217
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,510
You’re not cultivating
in your Dragon Pool.

218
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,880
I am worried.

219
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,150
That’s why I’m here.

220
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,240
Why are you worried about me?

221
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,350
OK, all right.

222
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,390
So, Dragon King, did you

223
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,030
try to grab the Ancient Golden Armor?

224
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,240
How’s it?

225
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,440
Did you get it?

226
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,880
Of course.

227
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,510
That’s great.

228
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Finally you will become a real dragon.

229
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,910
Let me get some good wine

230
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,680
and wait with you.

231
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,710
Let’s do it next time.

232
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,000
I plan to visit the human world for
a few days.

233
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,200
A year in the human world equals
a day in the heaven.

234
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,830
It helps me to kill time.

235
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,030
The mortals love wealth, fame, jewelry

236
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,150
and beauties which are all useless.

237
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,440
You hate those things.

238
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Why do you want to visit there?

239
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,680
I can smell

240
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,760
something different

241
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,680
on you.

242
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,830
What different smell?

243
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,390
I just feel bored in the heaven.

244
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,880
That’s why I want to pay a visit there.

245
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,390
See you.

246
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,240
A-thousand-year-old Dragon King

247
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,470
wants some fun in the human world?

248
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,590
Liuying is not here.

249
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Could anything happen to her?

250
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,480
What can I do?

251
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,230
Why am I so useless?

252
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,960
Osmanthus cakes.

253
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,840
It’s hot.

254
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,110
She was not eaten by the dragon demon.

255
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,600
It must be Liuying who prepared

256
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,360
those steaming hot cakes for me.

257
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,080
I need to save her.

258
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,910
Don’t eat me. Don’t eat me.

259
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,200
Do I look like a Dragon King who eats
elves?

260
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,320
Of course not.

261
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,910
Dragon King.

262
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,680
You look so

263
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,320
handsome and glamorous.

264
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,270
You won’t eat a skinny and tasteless

265
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,150
blue bird like me.

266
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,680
And my flesh will get stuck between your

267
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,480
teeth, which is bad for your image.

268
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,600
Am I right?

269
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,560
Your smiling face is uglier than a
crying one.

270
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,150
I tried my best.

271
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,720
You know

272
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,440
mortals are different than us.

273
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,560
They have 44 muscles

274
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,360
on their face.

275
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,320
50 muscles are used when they smile.

276
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,750
When they fake a smile, ten are used.

277
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,390
That’s called putting on a false smile.

278
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,600
-That’s because…
-Shut up.

279
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,800
Why are you so close with Liuying?

280
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,910
Tell me the truth.

281
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,110
If I find you’re lying to me...

282
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,960
I…

283
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,600
I… I am here to return her favors.

284
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,680
My leg was injured.

285
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,270
She found out my injury

286
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,360
and took care of me.

287
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,030
I got recovered because of her.

288
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,750
That’s why I keep her in my mind

289
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,270
and try to pay it back.

290
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,910
When I saw beautiful flowers,

291
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,230
I brought them to her.

292
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,600
-And put them on the window.
-Stop.

293
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,630
Dragon King.

294
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,510
If you find it inappropriate,

295
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,960
I will stop visiting her

296
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,390
right away.

297
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,080
I’ll stay one mile away from her.

298
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,910
No, no, no.

299
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,360
-Ten miles.
-Stop.

300
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
From now on,

301
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,560
if you want to be safe,

302
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,440
you need to obey my orders.

303
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,720
OK.

304
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,800
Yes, Dragon King.

305
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,360
My first order is

306
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,720
when answering my question,

307
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,910
reply with one sentence only.

308
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,480
But if I can’t make it clear, I won’t

309
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,750
be able to understand your orders.

310
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,990
-Then I…
-My second order is

311
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,990
you will treat Liuying

312
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,510
the same way as before.

313
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,440
I’ll obey your order

314
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,230
and act in the same way as before.

315
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,230
What is your name?

316
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,080
Dragon King, my name is Qingqing,

317
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,800
which came from The Book of Odes.

318
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,720
Stop showing off like intellectuals.

319
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,990
You didn’t even transform well.

320
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,480
I was born like this.

321
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,630
I can’t get rid of it.

322
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,460
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

323
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Here you are.

324
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,320
OK.

325
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,150
Liuying, are you not

326
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,150
going for temple pilgrimage with me?

327
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,600
Please give me a break.

328
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,200
You know I have to sleep in my own bed.

329
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,360
I will not sleep well in the temple, and

330
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,600
will yawn when the monks are chanting.

331
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,910
Mrs. Xiahou will be upset about me.

332
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,150
That’s right.

333
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,030
When I’m not at home,

334
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,720
don’t just play around.

335
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,600
I need to go.

336
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,990
Sugar-coated haws.

337
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,200
Sugar-coated haws.

338
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,510
-Would you like some?
-OK.

339
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,750
Sugar-coated haws.

340
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,990
Would you like some yarn?

341
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,800
I have all the colors. Take a look.

342
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
How much is it?

343
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,320
Two pennies.

344
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
Two pennies.

345
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,910
Here you are.

346
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,910
Thanks.

347
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,910
Good bye.

348
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,440
She loves snacks.

349
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,990
Shall I just

350
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,720
buy some cakes to return her favor?

351
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,840
No.

352
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,750
I will be mocked by the heaven realm.

353
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,360
Thank you.

Would you like some books, sir?

363
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,480
Why is she so happy to buy a book?

364
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,750
Do you have books which are more

365
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,080
delicate and more rare?

366
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,680
What kind of rare books do you want?

367
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,680
Something like Spring Palace (erotic)?

Spring Palace, Winter Palace, whatever,

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,840
as long as they’re rare.

370
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,270
It has to be
about Dragon King’s requite.

371
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,030
I have books about requite.

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,740
(Chapter 5)

380
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,270
Your Majesty, are you feeling better?

381
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,990
You cut your own flesh

382
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,480
to save my life.

383
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,630
How do I return your favor?

384
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,030
I am Your Majesty’s woman.

385
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,080
Every inch of my body

386
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,750
belongs to you.

387
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,440
You don’t need to pay me back.

388
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,910
No.

389
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
I have to.

390
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,870
I want you to be committed to me.

391
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,440
Be committed to you?

392
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,990
Only I can have sons with

393
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,320
Your Majesty.

394
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,360
OK.

395
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,750
I will be committed to you.

396
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,360
A lifelong commitment.

397
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
That’s how emperors requite.

398
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,750
Yes. You got it.

399
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
That’s why she wouldn’t tell

400
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,440
whenever I asked her.

401
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
She was shy. You should be

402
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,270
more enthusiastic and initiative.

403
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,480
How’s it, sir?

404
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,680
I’ll take it.

405
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,220
(The Legend of the White Snake)

406
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,510
Xiaobai. Why are you still here?

407
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,440
What are you doing?

408
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,440
I got it.

409
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,680
What’s that? I don’t get it.

410
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,030
What are you doing? Let go of me.

411
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,230
I got it.

412
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,110
Requite means to be committed.

413
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
What’s to be committed?

414
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,680
Let go of me.

415
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,360
Isn’t requite about commitment?

416
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,110
We will sleep in the same bed.

417
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,480
Who is going to sleep with you?

418
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,840
Who wants to be committed to you?

419
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,870
Let go of me.

420
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,480
Let go of me.

421
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,480
Let go.

422
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,560
The book says

423
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,720
when she says no,

424
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,080
she means yes.

425
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,390
This is my room. Get out.

426
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,910
Yes, right.

427
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,720
We should get back to my Dragon Pool.

428
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,840
Let go of me.

429
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,230
Let go of me.

430
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,840
What’s wrong?

431
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,270
Where’s it? I want to go home.

432
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,600
All right.

433
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,910
Don’t come over.

434
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,030
Don’t you want to go home?
I’ll bring you back.

435
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,750
I don’t need it.
I have a fear of heights.

436
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,320
I’ll go back by myself.

437
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Do you know where it is?

438
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,680
How do you go back?

439
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,600
Let me bring you home.

440
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
No. I’ll go by myself.

441
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,230
It’s the wrong direction.

442
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,700
(Chapter 5)

443
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,230
I did what the book says.

444
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,480
What’s wrong?

445
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
We agreed to drink together,

446
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,270
not to watch you drinking.

447
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,230
Can you leave me alone?

448
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,080
I need a drinking pal.

449
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,390
So I asked someone
to keep an eye on your place.

450
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,750
Why are you so upset?

451
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,510
I can’t figure out one thing.

452
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,870
Tell me.

453
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,150
If I am committed to you,

454
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
would you refuse?

455
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,680
You?

456
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,200
Committed?

457
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,150
-Of course…
-I did what the book says.

458
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,910
But I was refused.

459
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,030
So you have a crush.

460
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,030
What are you doing?

461
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,600
Why is she always in my mind?

462
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,510
What’s wrong with me?

463
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,800
How did you get injured on your foot?

464
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,230
It’s serious.

465
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,230
Let’s go to the mountain,

466
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,390
and get some herbs.

467
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,800
I’ll cure you.

468
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
You look silvery white.

469
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,440
Shall I...? Shall I call you Xiaobai?

470
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,910
I don’t know why

471
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,320
I always see you in front of me.

472
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,360
Kitten, you’re injured.

473
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
I can’t hold you now.

474
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,800
Let me make a basket

475
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,320
for you.

476
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,480
And then we’ll get herbs.

477
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,080
Look, how do I look now?

478
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,960
It’s called headband.

479
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
It covers your

480
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,480
meteor scar just on the spot.

481
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,960
It took me a lot of hard work

482
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,990
and efforts

483
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,200
to buy it from human market.

484
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,150
When talking about making up,

485
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,720
humans are more creative

486
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,030
than elves and demons.

487
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,960
Look, how colorful it is.

488
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,560
They have different patterns too.

489
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,320
I am the best looking bird elf.

490
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,910
You are the most beautiful one.

491
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,230
Eagles are crazy about me.

492
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,200
Crows all fall for you.

493
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,510
Let alone sparrows.

494
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,200
Look at my attractive body,

495
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,600
my beautiful face,

496
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,750
my delicate lips,

497
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,560
my high nose,

498
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,840
my intriguing eyes.

499
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,840
Qingqing.

500
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,840
It fell on the ground.

501
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,480
Well,

502
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,600
how come I couldn’t

503
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,800
get rid of the scar?

504
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
Yeah.

505
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,750
How come it can’t be removed

506
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,630
by magic?

507
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,680
I really want to find the answer

508
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
at the Immortal of Fate’s library.

509
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,910
I heard you can find the answers

510
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,600
to all the questions.

511
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,480
Really?

512
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,390
Yes.

513
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,680
Add a few more herbs,

514
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,270
it will be more effective.

515
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,270
Is anyone there?

516
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,360
