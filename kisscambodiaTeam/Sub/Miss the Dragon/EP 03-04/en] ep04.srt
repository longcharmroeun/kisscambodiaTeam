17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,800
It’s getting late.

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,310
I should go to bed.

19
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,200
You are right.

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,990
It’s really late.

21
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,800
Have a rest.

22
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,070
You’re not leaving?

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,920
Don’t we

24
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,040
have a rest together?

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,910
Didn’t I tell you

26
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,960
men and women should keep distance?

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,960
A woman who says that

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,960
usually ends up with a gentleman.

29
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,990
So, you’ll marry me in the end.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I really can’t marry you.

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,990
Do you

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,830
detest me?

33
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,800
No.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,710
Perhaps I don’t understand mortal love

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,990
or I don’t know how to please you.

36
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,680
But I’ll give it a good try.

37
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,630
Only people who love each other

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,270
can get married.

39
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,550
Forget about the operas and novels.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
They’re not real.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,270
Anyway, unmarried men and women

42
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,350
cannot share a bedroom
in the mortal world.

43
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,630
But this is the only room left
of the inn.

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,190
Where could I sleep?

45
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,960
You are the Dragon King.

46
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,120
Why sleep in the inn with me?

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,190
Go back to your Dragon Pool.

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,990
Go now.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,400
Get out of here.

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,760
Come on.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,470
Unmarried men and women

52
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,550
cannot share a bedroom
in the mortal world.

53
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,910
We shared a bed before.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,120
Didn’t that make us a married couple?

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,760
Good girl, Marble.

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,470
Go to sleep.

57
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,590
If sharing a bed means we’re married,

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,520
why did she refuse me to return favor

59
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,470
and not marry me?

60
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,750
Hard to follow.

61
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,150
She smells cool

62
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,750
and fragrant.

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,750
I didn’t lose sleep in a strange room,

64
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,800
and woke up naturally.

65
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Marble,

66
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,000
Dragon King may go back to his pool.

67
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,750
You’re still here.

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
You slept well last night, didn’t you?

69
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,590
Yes, great.

70
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,560
How about you?

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,000
It was great,

72
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,470
but later a silly pig

73
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,750
crawled on me

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
and I was almost suffocated.

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
There are pigs in Dragon Pool?

76
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Well, can the pigs

77
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,000
get in your bed as they wish?

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,560
Let’s go.

79
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,170
Good girl.

80
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,540
-Don’t cry.
-Look.

81
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,230
Look what I got here.

82
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,310
Let me take it.

83
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,910
Good girl.

84
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,000
Let’s go.

85
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
We’re going home.

86
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,360
Listen. Is it beautiful?

87
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,070
What?

88
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,350
What do you mean?

89
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,070
Your arm hurts?

90
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,420
(Luofeng Pavilion)

91
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,760
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

92
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,910
Forgive me.

93
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,350
That’s the silk handkerchief
Immortal Fox gave me.

94
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,240
Immortal Fox?

95
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,150
Qingqing.

96
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,800
Yes.

97
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,590
Fire, there’s a fire.

98
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Why not perform the extinguishing spell?

99
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,470
That’s because you sealed

100
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,120
my power.

101
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,200
Of course I couldn’t perform the spell,

102
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,950
or conjure water.

103
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,880
Otherwise,

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,880
I could have transformed to Blue Bird

105
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,510
and flap the fire out with my wings

106
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
even if I’m bad with spells.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,560
So you shouldn’t have...

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,640
I’ll get you a new robe.

109
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,760
Three days.

110
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,120
No food for you for three days.

111
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,640
I...I didn’t mean to.

112
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,560
You...you...

113
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,200
You’re the cruelest man in the world.

114
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,640
Why did I smile?

115
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,950
Marble, your wound will be healed soon.

116
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,470
When you fully recover,

117
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,030
I’ll send you home.

118
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,590
Marble,

119
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,880
where did the Dragon King

120
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,350
go?

121
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,200
He isn’t coming back, is he?

122
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,640
You’re back.

123
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,120
Here.

124
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,710
Roasted chestnuts.

125
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
You haven't been so happy for some time.

126
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
Enjoy it.

127
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,000
It tastes

128
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,800
just like those I had in the capital.

129
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,270
I thought there wouldn’t be

130
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,350
such tasty roasted chestnuts
in the town.

131
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,080
They are the chestnuts from the capital.

132
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,440
Sure they taste the same.

133
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,510
You went back to the capital

134
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,590
to buy the roasted chestnuts?

135
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,680
Just some chestnuts.

136
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,120
No big deal.

137
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,350
Thank you.

138
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,950
You’re welcome.

139
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,640
I’m requiting your kindness.

140
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,880
In fact, you don’t need to do that.

141
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,470
Your company along the way

142
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,270
has made me very happy.

143
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,080
Are you alright?

144
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,710
Do you feel uncomfortable?

145
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,880
Let me check it.

146
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,320
Your pulse is irregular.

147
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,910
Is it because of your old wound?

148
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,080
Does it hurt?

149
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
Get up. Let me see it.

150
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,240
I’m fine.

151
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,880
Are you afraid of pain?

152
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,760
Are you kidding me?

153
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,120
My wound is healed.

154
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,240
Are you sure?

155
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,710
Not even a scar.

156
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,120
Right.

157
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
You are the Dragon King.

158
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,470
You’re blushing.

159
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,880
Are you having a fever?

160
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,240
I’m fine.

161
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,000
It’s stuffy here. I...

162
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,390
I need to

163
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,640
get some fresh air.

164
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Then I’ll be fine.

165
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,000
Vulnerable people shouldn’t go out.

166
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,510
Why am I so hot all over

167
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,240
and why is my heart racing?

168
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,560
(The Garden)
Take a look, gentlemen.

169
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,710
The two most beautiful girls

170
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,760
are going to perform

171
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,120
the new White Snake and Green Snake.

172
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,710
Gentlemen, hurry up.

173
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,440
It begins soon.

174
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,510
You don’t want to miss it.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
(The New White Snake and Green Snake)
Men, come in quickly.

176
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
(The New White Snake and Green Snake)
The performance begins soon.

177
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,080
You don’t want to miss it.

178
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,830
Come on, gentlemen, come in please.

179
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,270
(The Garden)
Sir, come in please.

180
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,910
Come and take a look.

181
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,510
(The Garden)
A play by the two most beautiful girls.

182
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,270
(The Garden)
It begins soon.

183
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,680
Qing, you and I

184
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,470
have cultivated for thousands of years.

185
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:55,590
Don’t be fooled by Fahai.

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,150
Suzhen, what is good about Xu Xian?

187
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,950
What is love?

188
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:09,470
About love, I don’t know how to put it.

189
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,760
All I know is he’s always in my mind.

190
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,830
From dawn to dusk, I miss him.

191
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,710
Racing heart

192
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,680
is a symbol of love.

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,120
That’s mortal love.

194
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,590
So you’re not requiting his kindness,

195
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,680
but have fallen in love with him.

196
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,000
I think I should just take him here.

197
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,080
I don’t believe

198
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,030
he won’t fall for your beauty.

199
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,950
That’s right.

200
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,470
Qing, mortal love is disciplined.

201
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:54,950
People in love care about each other,

202
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,200
but they keep it quiet

203
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,440
from others.

204
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,270
When the tokens of love are exchanged,

205
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,800
they can hold a wedding ceremony

206
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,800
and be happy together

207
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,990
for their lifetime.

208
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,320
I see.

209
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,200
Once the tokens of love are given,

210
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,870
direct contact is allowed
between men and women.

211
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,910
Qing, when you and I

212
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,230
cultivated in Mount Emei,

213
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,560
our cave was high and cold.

214
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,990
We were buried in clouds every day.

215
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,840
No company, mister?

216
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,990
Your chestnut cake tastes special.

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,230
Pack some for two, please.

218
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,390
This is our specialty.

219
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,720
You can enjoy here, but can’t take away.

220
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,230
Then get them ready.

221
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,390
I’ll come back.

222
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,840
…enjoy the landscape.

223
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,230
Where have you been? Do you feel better?

224
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,390
Much better.

225
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
What brings you out?

226
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,630
Did you also

227
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,630
have a racing heart like mine?

228
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,320
I came out to look for you.

229
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,600
I think maybe the pig hurt

230
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,270
your heart last night,

231
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,030
so I booked two rooms for tonight

232
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,750
and you can have a good sleep.

233
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,630
You’re looking for me?

234
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,360
Do you care about me?

235
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,800
Sure I do.

236
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,680
People in love care about each other.

237
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,680
I heard only people in love

238
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,150
care about each other.

239
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,630
No.

240
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
Um...

241
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,200
Friends also care about each other.

242
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,150
I know. I know.

243
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,720
Keep it from others.

244
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,560
When the tokens of love are exchanged...

245
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,870
You can’t say it.

246
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,600
By the way,

247
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,870
I know a place where

248
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,680
great chestnut cakes are served.

249
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,720
You’ll like them. Go.

250
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,750
You didn’t eat any at all.

251
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,110
Delicious.

252
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,200
Sir, you paid a precious pearl.

253
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,630
I’m Peony. Thank you.

254
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,230
Never mind.

255
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,600
My chamber is cozy.

256
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,910
Would you like to come with me?

257
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,870
No thanks.

258
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,110
Let’s go.

259
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,030
Sir.

260
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,230
Miss, you’re not alone here.

261
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,680
Give yourself some honor.

262
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,680
Young lady, you must be joking.

263
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,320
Which girl who has honor

264
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
would come to The Garden?

265
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320
The Garden?

266
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,560
Yes.

267
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,990
Allow me.

268
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,790
Sir.

269
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,230
You mean

270
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
this is a pleasure house?

271
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,360
Yes, miss. Don’t be so surprised.

272
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,910
When I served the young master,

273
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,560
he quite enjoyed it

274
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,510
and he paid a great deal.

275
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,990
It was great.

276
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,440
You brought me to a pleasure house?

277
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,360
And this woman and you...

278
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,080
What is a pleasure house?

279
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Liuying.

280
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,200
Don’t touch me.

281
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,110
Liuying, what’s wrong?

282
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,840
Didn’t you like the chestnut cakes?

283
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,840
I was worried about you

284
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,510
and looked for you everywhere at night.

285
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,720
Yet you went to the pleasure house

286
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,390
and had fun with Peony.

287
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,080
And you brought me there too.

288
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,150
Seeing you angry

289
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,110
pains me in the chest.

290
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,510
It feels more terrible
than heart racing.

291
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
I didn’t know The Garden

292
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,510
is a pleasure house.

293
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,390
But if you don’t like the place,

294
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,030
we won’t go there anymore.

295
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,600
Well, how

296
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,440
did you get to know Peony?

297
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,270
I went to watch
The Legend of White Snake

298
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,800
and found the chestnut cakes delicious,

299
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,200
so, I brought you there.

300
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,110
It seems

301
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
I misunderstood you.

302
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,870
Don’t ever go to

303
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,390
the pleasure house again, alright?

304
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,360
Alright.

305
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,800
My lord, the Heaven is now in peace.

306
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,510
♪Autumn orchid
green leaves and violet stem♪

307
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,390
♪In the hall of beauties I’m Qingqing♪

308
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,110
♪Autumn orchid

309
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,870

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,230
-Qingqing.
-I...

311
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,720
Yes, my lord.

312
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,440
Bingxing,

313
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,800
take her to the River of Tears
to practice.

314
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,200
If she’s genuinely tone deaf,

315
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,510
give her the post of Grief Purger.

316
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,600
Yes.

317
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,680
I don’t want to be the Grief Purger.

318
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,680
It’s cold and damp
by the River of Tears.

319
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,080
Without feathers, I could catch a cold.

320
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,510
What’s up?

321
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,200
What brings you here?

322
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,960
I heard you’re in danger.

323
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,200
I stung my finger. It’s nothing.

324
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,750
Why put the finger in your mouth?

325
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,750
Because

326
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
it relieves the pain.

327
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,510
So like cats, you lick

328
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,230
the wound to get cured.

329
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,440
Why are you still up

330
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,630
and sewing at this hour?

331
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,390
I can’t sleep in a strange bed.

332
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Strange bed?

333
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,720
I mean

334
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,870
I’m used to my bed

335
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,990
with my quilts and pillow.

336
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,320
In a different bed, I can’t fall asleep.

337
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,960
Like now.

338
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,390
But I slept well

339
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,480
last night.

340
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,560
Don’t worry about me.

341
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,180
(Xiahou’s Mansion)

342
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,420
(Love with Dragon)

343
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,750
Love with Dragon.

344
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,390
The bed isn’t the problem.

345
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,230
I am.

346
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
Bravo! Bravo!

347
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,320
There is an opera on.

348
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,840
Raccoon for A Prince.
I watched it before.

349
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,680
Lord Bao delivered justice

350
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,270
and proved Concubine Li’s innocence.

351
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,390
Delivered justice?

352
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,750
Nothing but people in power

353
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,320
speak louder.

354
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,390
I think

355
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,750
there’s justice in the mortal world.

356
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
There may not be justice even in Heaven.

357
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,030
Why did you say that?

358
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,720
What’s wrong?

359
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,960
Did you

360
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,150
learn it by experience?

361
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,630
What could you do even if I tell you?

362
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,960
What’s wrong with you?

363
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Are you bothered by something?

364
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,030
You can talk to me.

365
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,800
It will make you feel better.

366
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,840
If you’d like to share,

367
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,600
I’ll be glad to hear it.

368
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,080
So,

369
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,110
what is the injustice

370
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,990
you suffered from?

371
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,360
The Stone of Goddess Nuwa?

372
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,750
Guards of the terrace?

373
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,030
Anybody here?

374
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,200
Refreshing.

375
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,840
The purifying Stone of Goddess Nuwa

376
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,360
cures the wound.

377
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,750
Amazing.

378
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,870
Insolent man!

379
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,320
(Immortal Ziyang)
How dare you steal the Stone?

380
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,270
You get me wrong.

381
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,360
I’m not stealing it.

382
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,270
We have evidence.
Stop justifying yourself.

383
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Guards, seize him!

384
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,110
-Yes.
-Yes.

385
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,990
God,

386
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,630
this is the dragon demon

387
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,600
who attempted to steal the Stone.

388
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,480
Why did you try to steal the Stone?

389
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,840
I fell onto the Terrace of Nuwa

390
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,600
and basked in its radiance.

391
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,720
Absurd.

392
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,560
The Stone is a heavenly object

393
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,480
and the Terrace is heavily guarded.

394
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,560
How could you possibly see its radiance?

395
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,030
When I fell onto it, no one was there.

396
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,230
It’s impossible.

397
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,270
Thirty-six heavenly guards
keep watching in turns.

398
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,800
It must be guarded.

399
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,480
Then you should ask

400
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,150
why the guards weren’t there.

401
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,270
God, we should look into

402
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,360
the guards if they quit their posts.

403
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,390
Find it out.

404
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,960
Yes, my lord.

405
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,360
The demon tried to steal the Stone.

406
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,200
How should we punish him?

407
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,150
Thunder strike for a thousand years.

408
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,390
Return to his original form
and start over again.

409
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,560
Granted.

410
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,150
This is unfair.

411
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,510
I don’t accept it.

412
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,320
Thunder strike for a thousand years?

413
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,270
Those guards quit their posts!

414
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,270
How could they pass the buck to you?

415
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,960
This is outrageous.

416
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,750
So when Lady Xiahou and I

417
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,600
found you in the garden,

418
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,360
you were just struck by thunder, right?

419
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,910
It’s really heartbreaking.

420
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,750
Yes.

421
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,200
It hurt a lot.

422
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,200
It pains here

423
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,200
and here too.

424
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,080
So at a moment like this,

425
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,030
she doesn’t care about that men and
women shouldn’t have direct contact.

426
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,750
