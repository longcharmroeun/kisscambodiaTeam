Add a few more herbs,

18
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,110
it will be more effective.

19
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,560
I’ll look for them.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,840
Are you okay, kitten?

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,990
You put yourself in such a mess

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,520
to save a wild cat?

23
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,520
You again?

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,680
Stay away from me.

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,910
It’s the law of jungle.

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
Death and life are destined.

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,630
Why do you ask for trouble?

28
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,830
No trouble at all!

29
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,430
I can cure it.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,120
Animals always
get injured in the mountain.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,470
Can you cure them all?

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,910
Since I came across it,

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,190
I will cure it.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,350
Father said that doctors can’t cure
all the people in the world,

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,830
but they can cure the ones they meet.

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,240
I’m not arguing with you.

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,600
If you have to save this cat,

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,240
I can help you.

39
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,680
Don’t bother.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,320
I can do it myself. Thank you.

41
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,960
Fine.

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,680
Then go by yourself.

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,830
Houttuynia cordata...

44
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,240
Houttuynia cordata!

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,880
The last is golden-leaf chrysanthemum.

46
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,800
Golden-leaf chrysanthemum!

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
What are you thinking about?

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,800
You can talk?

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,150
Are you worried about me?

50
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,470
Is anybody there?

51
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,590
Who is it?

52
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,870
Thank you.

53
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,470
(Bingxing)
I’m Bingxing from Luofeng Pavilion.

54
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,240
Thank you for helping us
kill the fleeing demons.

55
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,590
May I ask your name?

56
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,350
Yuchi Longyan.

57
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,000
Luofeng Pavilion can’t
even control the demons.

58
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
You are the Dragon King.

59
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,070
Luofeng Pavilion owes you a favor.

60
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,350
It’ll pay you back some day.

61
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,190
I’m leaving.

62
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,470
You got hurt?

63
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Just small injury.

64
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,000
No, it must be treated now.

65
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,440
I’ll treat you.

66
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,400
What a grand library!

67
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,560
Who are you?

68
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,350
Who are you?

69
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,830
How can

70
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,590
there be such an attractive,

71
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,590
elegant

72
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,350
and handsome person?

73
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,510
In the human world...

74
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,470
No, no. In the elf world,

75
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
I’ve never seen anyone
as handsome as you.

76
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,150
You don’t treat yourself as an outsider.

77
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,560
I haven’t asked you who you are

78
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,270
and what you’re doing here.

79
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,590
But you asked me first.

80
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,320
I... I’m the bird elf Qingqing.

81
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,640
You... You are Immortal of Fate?

82
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,470
Exactly.

83
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,270
Oh my.

84
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,390
I always thought

85
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,510
you were an old man.

86
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,270
I didn’t expect you to be such

87
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,710
a young and handsome immortal.

88
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
I have to tell

89
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,640
my friends on earth and in heaven.

90
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,880
I can’t let rumors ruin your reputation.

91
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,270
Look how handsome you are.

92
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,200
You are so talkative.

93
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,880
You shouldn’t come here.

94
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,830
I will not punish you today.

95
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,440
Get out of here.

96
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,910
No.

97
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Please allow me to read the books here.

98
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,440
As soon as I find a solution,

99
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,910
I’ll leave.

100
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,910
Please.

101
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,350
Meteor mark.

102
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,560
Take your clothes off.

103
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
I’ll apply medicine to you.

104
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,080
Now?

105
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,120
Don’t think too much.

106
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,080
I just wanna apply medicine to you.

107
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,950
Here we go.

108
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,440
This medicine may make you painful.

109
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,800
Hang in there.

110
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,640
Thank you for saving me.

111
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,320
I’m not used to

112
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,760
you talking to me this way.

113
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,760
Why does my face burn

114
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,950
when she is close to me?

115
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,080
It’s done.

116
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Spotty, it’s your turn.

117
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,390
So,

118
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,030
do you fall in love with a mortal

119
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,080
and want to find the books
to see what you should do?

120
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,270
Fall in love with a mortal?

121
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,560
How is it possible?

122
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,320
I have only one friend
in the human world.

123
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,560
She is Liuying from Xiahou’s Mansion.

124
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,590
She’s my savior,

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,350
not my love.

126
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,350
Liuying from Xiahou’s Mansion.

127
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,390
You’re really interesting.

128
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,000
I’ll make an exception today.

129
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,350
Tell me.

130
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,200
What can I do for you?

131
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,510
Really?

132
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,510
Sir,

133
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,590
you’re not only handsome, but fine.

134
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,000
You’re unique in heaven and earth.

135
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,440
I...

136
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,000
I want to find out
this scar on my forehead.

137
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,270
I was the most beautiful bird elf.

138
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,910
But this scar

139
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,590
becomes a hindrance to my beauty.

140
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,590
And I think it is weird.

141
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,760
It’s always on my forehead
no matter what I become.

142
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,470
So I went here and wanted to...

143
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,240
It’s meteor mark.

144
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,350
You know it?

145
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,510
Have a look.

146
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,620
(Book of Reincarnation)

147
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,760
It is the symbol of the soul.

148
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,350
If you want to remove it,

149
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,880
you have to go to Luofeng Pavilion.

150
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,560
Thank you so much.

151
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,260
(Book of Reincarnation)

152
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,200
You are so nice.

153
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,270
Spotty, it’s your turn.

00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,880
Spotty?

156
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,640
I just named it.

157
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,590
Do you randomly name

158
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,910
all the animals you save?

159
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,390
Not all of them.

160
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,200
Just special ones.

161
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,510
Who is the most special?

162
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,150
The most special?

163
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,120
Of course, it’s...

164
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,120
In that case,

165
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,590
call it Marble.

166
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Marble.

167
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,910
It sounds good.

168
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,880
Then your name is Marble, okay?

169
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Marble.

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,660

(The Legend of the White Snake)

172
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,270
The white snake
is also to repay the favor.

173
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,660
According to this book...

174
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,410
(The white snake repays the favor)

175
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,100
(Love in West Lake
in a rainy spring day)

176
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,510
It’s raining.

177
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,080
Bad weather.

178
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,880
Suddenly it began to rain.

179
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,830
Here you are.

180
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,030
Thank you.

181
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,910
Don’t you share the umbrella with me?

182
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,110
You just hold it.

183
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,680
Okay.

184
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,560
It’s not the same as in the book,

185
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,320
but we walk together under one umbrella.

186
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,360
It stops raining.

187
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,630
Your wound gets wet.

188
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,680
Are you worried about me?

189
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,870
I’ll bind it up for you later.

190
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,800
Okay.

191
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,800
According to the story of
“Borrowing the Umbrella” in the book,

192
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,680
her attitude is really different.

193
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,720
It seems that the methods in this book

194
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,270
are effective.

195
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,750
This is Luofeng Pavilion.

196
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,680
It’s too depressing.

197
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,390
The new-born souls
have to go to Luofeng Pavilion

198
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,150
before they go to the human world.

199
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,030
For the sake of our six hundred years

200
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,480
of friendship,

201
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,150
please don’t let us drink the Lethe Tea.

202
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,600
Drink the Lethe Tea
given by the Grief Purger

203
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
in the River of Tears.

204
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,720
Forget the past and
descend to the human world.

205
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,200
It’s so stupid to be punished for love.

206
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,110
It would be better for you
not to see each other again.

207
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,560
No need to thank me.

208
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,840
Xue Qianxun, master of Luofeng Pavilion,

209
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,560
(Xue Qianxun)
is cold-blooded and impartial.

210
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,340
(Luofeng Pavilion)

211
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,090
-Look at that man.
-So handsome.

212
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,160
-If only I could marry him.
-He’s so handsome.

213
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,870
Sir, could you give me a hand?

214
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,230
Sir.

215
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,750
Sir.

216
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,560
What’s wrong with me?

217
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,150
Don’t get me wrong, Dragon King.

218
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,150
I didn’t mean that.

219
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,870
I think you did right just now.

220
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,200
I can return the favor.

221
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,030
Dragon King, have you heard that

222
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
men and women should keep distance?

223
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,270
I know.

224
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,840
Men and women should keep distance.

225
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,750
Xu Xian said the same thing

226
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,870
when he lent Bai Suzhen an umbrella.

227
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,560
But Bai Suzhen...

228
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,600
Let me say it again.

229
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,990
You don’t have to return the favor.

230
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,630
I know.

231
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,200
It was wrong to make a commitment.

232
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,390
It’s all the fault of this book.

233
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,620
(An Evilly Charming Emperor's Requite )

234
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,680
You did that

235
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,440
because you read this?

236
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,270
This is a bad book. You can’t read it.

237
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
If you read this book,

238
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
people would think you are a bad man.

239
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,840
There are books in the human world
that teach people to be bad.

240
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
You don’t read bad books, do you?

241
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,910
Of course not.

242
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,960
It seems that

243
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,480
I have to finish reading
how the white snake returns the favor.

244
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,620
(The Legend of the White Snake)

245
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,110
Xue Qianxun has a Fleeting Pipa.

246
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,840
But he never plays it.

247
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,750
It can remove the meteor mark
on your forehead.

248
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,320
Just get the string, grind it
and apply the powder to your forehead,

249
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,110
and the mark will disappear.

250
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,800
This is the Fleeting Pipa.

251
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,630
Immortal of Fate didn’t cheat me.

252
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,150
It seems that my mark can be removed.

253
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,510
Hold on.

254
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,990
Is it too obvious?

255
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,480
Immortal of Fate said

256
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,320
I just need to get the string.

257
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,960
How dare you!

258
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,600
Catch her.

259
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
Yes.

260
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,440
Go.

261
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,440
Go.

262
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,560
My Lord.

263
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,680
She entered your room
without permission.

264
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,080
How to deal with her?

265
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Kill her.

266
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,030
Yes.

267
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,510
Sir. Your Highness.

268
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,600
No, no.

269
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,390
My Lord, please spare my life.

270
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,080
I’m just an elf.

271
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,360
It’s my fault

272
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,200
to enter your room without permission.

273
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,390
But I don’t want to steal any secret.

274
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,030
I just want to get...

275
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,230
to borrow your Fleeting Pipa.

276
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,030
You don’t play it anyway.

277
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,630
How dare you!

278
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,320
How dare you look at him like that.

279
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,840
Fleeting Pipa is his greatest treasure.

280
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,720
I can’t believe you want to borrow it.

281
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,440
I’m afraid you want to steal it.

282
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,030
No, no.

283
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,800
As an old saying goes,

284
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,990
goes...

285
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,200
Well...

286
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
The desire to look attractive
is universal.

287
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,990
I came to steal the string just to...

288
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,030
to remove the scar on my forehead.

289
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,440
No, no, the meteor mark on my soul.

290
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,320
Remove the scar on the soul

291
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,320
with the string?

292
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
I’ve never heard of it.

293
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,230
You’re obviously lying.

294
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,480
Take her away.

295
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,320
Yes.

296
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,560
-No!
-Wait.

297
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,320
For thousands of years,

298
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,870
no one dares to borrow my pipa.

299
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
She is so weird.

300
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,800
I’ll punish you
by being my maid for a hundred years.

301
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,960
I...

302
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,510
I’ll find out

303
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,840
what you really want to do.

304
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,600
Why did you take my power?

305
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,800
Take her away.

306
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,230
Go.

307
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,870
I’m a bird elf. I can’t be a maid.

308
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,230
-Go.
-Let me go. I can’t be a maid.

309
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,630
And I can’t do anything.

310
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,560
I only care about beauty.

311
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,480
You’ll regret

312
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,150
making me a maid.

313
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,360
Marble, you’ll sleep here tonight.

314
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,990
I understand.

315
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,680
What?

316
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,600
Bai Suzhen,
a thousand-year-old snake demon,

317
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,440
comes down to repay Xu Xian.

318
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,110
In order to return the favor,

319
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,990
she marries her savior.

320
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,910
If you like this way,

321
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,750
I can marry you.

322
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,150
Marry me?

323
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,560
Would you marry a dragon?

324
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,480
I... I can’t afford it.

325
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,750
Why?

326
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,150
Because...

327
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,800
Because I have no money.

328
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,110
It doesn’t matter.

329
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,320
I have a Dragon Pool

330
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,270
and a thousand years of spirit power.

331
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,270
You don’t have to worry about money.

332
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,560
And I don’t eat much.

333
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,440
You should be able to afford me.

334
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,110
No.

335
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,720
What? You still won’t?

336
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,600
I don’t mean it.

337
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,360
Actually,

338
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,910
I didn’t save you.

339
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,800
My lady saved you.

340
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,080
If you want to return the favor,

341
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,480
you should go to my lady.

342
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,270
But I clearly remember

343
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,990
the smell of your body.

344
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,270
I have a good intuition.

345
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,390
Or you don’t want to marry me

346
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,990
because I’m not a human being.

347
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,480
Of course not.

348
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,390
Or you don’t think I’m good-looking.

349
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,720
It doesn’t matter.

350
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,320
No matter what you like,

351
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,870
I can become what you like.

352
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,840
You like scholars?

353
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,560
Or generals?

354
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
(Dadu Baochao)

355
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,270
Or you like the rich?

356
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,270
I don’t think you’re not good-looking.

357
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,840
I walked all day today.

358
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,510
I’m a bit tired.

359
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,560
You are right.

360
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,510
It’s really late.

361
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,360
Have a rest.

362
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,150
You’re not leaving?

363
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,750
Don’t we

364
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
have a rest together?
