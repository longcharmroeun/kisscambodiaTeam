(Luofeng Pavilion)

18
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,480
Was I being too mean

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,630
just now?

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,430
He is the Lord after all

21
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,800
and he also gave me so many headwear

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,390
to cover up my mark.

23
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,120
Does it mean he cares about me?

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,710
It’s all your fault! You annoying mark.

25
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,190
You made me become as annoying as you.

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,270
He

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,630
may never talk to me again.

(Lady Divine made timely rain in dream)
(Appoint Lady Divine as concubine)

29
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,400
Is there

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,680
really a Lady Divine who can bring rain?

31
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,800
You know what?

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,800
That Demon Hunter Wang is really great.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,600
He used Demon Rope and Magical Gourd

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,040
to catch the demon Qingqing

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,960
at a stroke.

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,320
So great!

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,120
Well, if Qingqing is a demon,

38
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,240
and Ayu always stays with her,

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
Ayu may be a demon as well.

40
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,630
Nonsense!

41
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,270
It’s not nonsense!

42
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,520
She is a demon!

43
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,830
Demons appear in our town.

44
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,400
How can we live in peace?

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Right?

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,270
Yeah, how?

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
My daughter is not a demon!

48
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,430
If so,

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
you grew up with her,

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
then you’re a demon, too!

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,710
We are different!

52
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,400
Her birth got her mother killed.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,910
And she got Zhiyong killed as well!

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,630
That fire burnt Zhiyong

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,990
to ashes,

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,270
but Ayu is safe and sound.

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,270
What is she if she is not a demon?

58
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,190
-Yeah, she must be a demon.
-Demon girl.

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,160
My Ayu is not a demon!

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,070
She is…

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,710
What is she?

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,630
-She is…
-Go ahead!

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,990
She is Lady Divine!

64
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,550
The Imperial Notice says that

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Lady Divine comes from the Southeast.

66
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,350
Ayu is Lady Divine!

67
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,190
Who is Lady Divine?

68
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,470
Make way! Make way!

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Make way! His Excellency is here!

70
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,100
(Order Silence)

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,400
Who talked about Lady Divine just now?

72
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,800
He!

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,910
He said his daughter is Lady Divine!

74
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,120
Your Excellency,

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,160
please let me explain.

76
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,600
I just said it casually.

77
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
How dare you talk casually about
the Imperial Notice?

78
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,520
Guards! Arrest him!

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,430
-Yes, sir!
-Your Excellency!

80
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,150
Please spare me! Your Excellency!

81
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,560
-Your Excellency!
-Wait!

82
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,280
Ayu is here! Ayu is here.

83
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,190
Father!

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,240
Why do you arrest my father?

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,470
Who are you?

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,560
-I…
-Your Excellency,

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,190
she is his daughter.

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,910
She pretends to be Lady Divine!

89
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,280
It has nothing to do with her!

90
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,470
I said it myself.

91
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,280
Please just punish me alone.

92
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,750
Take him away!

93
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,680
Wait!

94
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,000
My father is right.

95
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,840
I’m the Lady Divine His Majesty wants.

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,060
How could it be?

97
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,130
-That’s ridiculous.
-Yeah.

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,910
You are Lady Divine?

99
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,150
Yes.

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
The Imperial Notice says

101
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,190
the Lady Divine is needed to pray
for rain.

102
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,520
I can bring rain.

103
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,800
How do you plan to do it?

104
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,280
Let my father go first.

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
OK. Let go of him!

106
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,150
Ayu!

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
Father, don’t worry.

108
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,400
Your Excellency, please set up an altar.

109
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,720
I’ll pray for rain.

110
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,190
Go set up the altar.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,150
Yes, sir!

112
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,800
Pray for rain?

113
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,520
Ayu brags too much this time!

114
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,590
Although you can use your power
to make some rain as Dragon King,

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,400
you can’t

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,030
make it rain in such a big Yuchi Town.

117
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,840
I will go to Thunderstorm Terrace

118
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,150
to borrow the Rain Wand.

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,240
Borrow?

120
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,400
You will only grab it.

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,630
You shall not come in!

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
I need to draw my magic charms.

123
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,520
It won’t work if I’m bothered.

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,590
Then, we will wait for you right here.

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Let’s go.

126
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,910
Ayu, I got you in trouble.

127
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,870
I shouldn’t lie!

128
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,000
Look at me! I should get punished!

129
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,000
Father.

130
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,470
All our money is here.

131
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,470
They will only focus on me.

132
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,070
Go rent a carriage and leave later!

133
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,400
Here.

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,190
No!

135
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,630
What about you if I leave?

136
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,560
We should leave together!

137
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,350
Father!

138
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,800
No! I should be the one to die first!

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,800
I’ll stop them! You leave first!

140
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Father! I haven’t got married.

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,030
I won’t die.

142
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,150
I heard the altar
is set up by the river.

143
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,870
Go wait for me at the dock
down the river.

144
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,030
I’ll find a chance to pretend to fall

145
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,910
and meet you soon.

146
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,240
We can go to our uncle.

147
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,630
Have you finished drawing?

148
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,190
Almost!

149
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,350
You have to come!

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,400
Father, trust me.

151
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,680
OK.

152
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,590
My Lord! My Lord! My Lord!

153
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,000
What’s wrong?

154
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,150
The Three-call Spell always worked!

155
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Is it…?

156
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,310
No way.

157
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,590
Xue Qianxun! Xue Qianxun!

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,070
Xue Qianxun!

159
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,590
Good.

160
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,350
Now you know to call my name directly.

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,190
Hurry up!

162
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,070
Go to help Dragon King get
the Rain Wand with me!

163
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Ayu is praying for rain.

164
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,520
She will be in trouble
if it doesn’t rain!

165
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Come on.

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,840
You don’t want to help her?

167
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,120
Ridiculous!

168
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,840
If you interfere in human affairs with
immortal power,

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,150
you’ll get punished by thunder!

170
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,350
Dragon King is strong enough to
withstand thunder strikes.

171
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
What about you?

172
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,560
Only one bolt of thunder

173
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,960
can blow you to ashes!

174
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,000
But…

175
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,910
I can’t do nothing and watch Ayu die!

176
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,150
If you don’t go, I’ll go alone!

177
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,280
You stay out of this matter!

178
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Go back to Luofeng Pavilion with me!

179
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
No! I…

180
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,240
Xue Qianxun!

181
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,440
Xue Qianxun! Let me go!

182
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,240
You! You big bully!

183
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,150
(Luofeng Pavilion)
I need to help Ayu!

184
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,910
(Luofeng Pavilion)
Xue Qianxun! Xue Qianxun!

185
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,300
(Spell for Rain)

186
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,150
Keep pretending.

187
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,320
I’d like to see how you will cheat us.

188
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,910
Start now.

189
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,710
Your Excellency,
it’s not the right time.

190
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,760
Let’s see what trick you’ll play.

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Guys! Watch carefully!

192
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,150
Don’t let this liar escape!

193
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,680
Quiet! It has nothing to do with you.

194
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,390
How long do you have to wait?

195
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,710
Father should have left by now.

196
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
I should hold on a little longer.

197
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,440
A burning joss stick.

198
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,270
The duration of a burning joss stick.

199
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,560
That’s a long time.

200
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,000
If the time is not right,

201
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,680
it will fail to rain.

202
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,880
Alright,

203
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,150
I’ll give you the time.

204
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,350
But I also have to remind you

205
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,030
that if your praying fails,

206
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,030
that’s a crime of deceiving the Emperor.

207
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,640
Bring her the joss stick.

208
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,320
Why hasn’t she come yet?

209
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,710
Ayu.

210
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
God,

211
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,470
please show mercy

212
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,590
and help my Ayu.

213
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,080
Let me kowtow to you. Please.

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,150
Time is up. You should start now.

215
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,240
Wait.

216
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,150
Can you do it or not?

217
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,350
If not,

218
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,680
just kowtow to everyone and confess
your mistake.

219
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,910
But the crime of deceit

220
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,510
is inevitable.

221
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,510
God,

222
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,350
I apologize to you

223
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,200
on behalf of my father and myself.

224
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,440
I shouldn’t brag about
being the Lady Divine.

225
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,510
But Yuchi Town has been dried up
for long.

226
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,240
If this continues, there will be famine.

227
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,080
Please show mercy

228
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,590
and rain a little.

229
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,510
You! You… Don’t come over!

230
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,510
Xuanming, Immortal of Rain,

231
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,000
please lend me the Rain Wand.

232
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,950
No!

233
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,830
I managed to get this job

234
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,390
of making rain from God.

235
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,680
You dragon demon don’t try to grab it!

236
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,880
I don’t want to fight.

237
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,760
I just want to use Rain Wand

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,510
to let it rain in Yuchi Town.

239
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,510
I have already made it rain

240
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,950
in the human world as God ordered.

241
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,000
Nonsense!

242
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,270
It didn’t rain in Yuchi Town at all.

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,000
I’m not that stupid to believe you.

244
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,560
You guys! Stop him!

245
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,150
Mr. Shen,

246
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,270
it’s already been hours.

247
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,830
There is not even a dark cloud,

248
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,560
let alone a drop of rain.

249
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,820
I can’t wait anymore.

250
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,660
This is a capital crime!

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,910
Enough!

252
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Guards! Arrest her!

253
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,950
Yes, sir!

254
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
Arrest her!

255
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,910
Arrest this liar!

256
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,910
She is a liar!

257
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,710
Why do you cheat us?

258
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,910
Where is the Rain Wand?

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,440
Stop it!

260
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,510
Ziyang! Help me!

261
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
Dragon demon, it’s you again!

262
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,320
You disturbed me while
I eliminated Blood Devil last time.

263
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,830
Now you come here
to bully Immortal of Rain?

264
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
So what?

265
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,510
You…

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
Immortal of Rain has taken the order
from God about the rain.

267
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
I was also there during the process.

268
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,000
It’s true that there is
a long drought in Yuchi Town.

269
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,270
There hasn’t been
a drop of rain recently.

270
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
I have told him just now.

271
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,350
I have received the request from
the Emperor of the human beings

272
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,150
and it rained yesterday.

273
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,350
Unless…

274
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,120
Someone holds up a big umbrella
over Yuchi Town.

275
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,320
Star Halo should appear after the rain.

276
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,470
But there was no rain.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,030
Maybe Yuchi Town is really

278
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,560
sheltered by something.

279
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,710
Sheltered?

280
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,000
We will know if we go and see.

281
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,830
Who is interfering with my rain?

282
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,200
Please wait. I’ll try again.

283
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,120
The result will be the same.

284
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,240
Who set up this huge barrier

285
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,390
to block the rain?

286
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,270
Do you remember

287
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,120
there was a light when Blood Devil died?

288
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,080
That might be his last grievance.

289
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,150
Yuchi Town is the place where he died.

290
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,390
He’s trying to turn this place
into a wasteland

291
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,880
for his burial.

292
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,150
Xuanming,

293
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,150
it’s of no use to try.

294
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,880
Come with me to report to God.

295
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,120
Yes.

296
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,910
Criminal Ruan Ayu

297
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,590
deceived all people and His Majesty.

298
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,200
Now,

299
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,880
sentence her to death

300
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,760
to worship Immortal of Rain.

301
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,880
Demon girl! I finally avenge Zhiyong!

302
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,760
Don’t talk nonsense!

303
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,640
Ruan Ayu,

304
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,350
do you have any last words to say?

305
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,910
Yes.

306
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,710
I have something to say.

307
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
Go ahead.

308
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,510
I want to admit my fault.

309
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,870
But it’s not to His Majesty.

310
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,630
I made a mistake

311
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
in giving hope to

312
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,840
my neighbors in Yuchi Town

313
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,840
and then letting you down.

314
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,800
Dear neighbors,

315
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,230
I

316
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,870
apologize

317
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,600
to you right here.

318
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,990
Father,

319
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,110
I’m unfilial.

320
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,150
I’ll repay your love and care

321
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,390
in the afterlife.

322
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,320
It smells so good!

323
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,720
Here. Eat it.

324
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,510
Have some more.

325
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,750
I know you.

326
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
You are Yuchi. You saved me.

327
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,230
Yuchi,

328
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,990
see you in the afterlife.

329
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,560
Is it finished?

330
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,740
(Order)

331
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,270
Behead her.

332
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
(Order)

333
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,360
Stop wasting your power.

334
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,800
The barrier of devil

335
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,870
seems to obey only the commands
of its owner.

336
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,680
We have to command in the name of
Blood Devil.

337
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,320
How could we know

338
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,150
the name he made himself?

339
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,020
(Chenyu Xiaojun Brave Eternal Master)

340
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,870
Brave Eternal Master.

341
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,390
What are you doing?

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,900
(Brave Eternal Master)

343
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,360
Brave Eternal Master’s order!

344
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,630
Break!

345
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,960
It rains! It’s really raining!

346
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,390
Hold the execution!

347
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,030
Lady Divine! Please stand up.

348
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,960
Lady Divine, sorry for my ignorance.

349
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,030
Please forgive me. Please.

350
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,910
It’s OK.

351
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,150
Untie her!

352
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,200
Yes, sir.

353
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,010
It’s raining!

354
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,960
Let go of me!

355
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,150
She is not Lady Divine! She lies!

356
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,080
She is…

357
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,680
Demon girl! She is a demon girl!

358
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,440
Let this crazy woman shut up.

359
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,800
Lady Divine, please have a seat.

360
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,270
Don’t bother.

361
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,800
Liu Yuxiang,

362
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,110
you’ve been calling me jinx for
more than a decade.

363
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,560
Have you ever thought of a day
like this?

364
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,270
Have you ever thought of this

365
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,680
when you asked Baldhead to kidnap me?

366
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,720
Lady Divine, how will you deal with

367
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,800
this crazy woman?

368
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,030
Let me think about it.

369
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,150
Ayu.

370
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,910
Ayu, please show mercy.

371
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,750
You…

372
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,680
Wait. Dear Lady Divine,

373
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,870
please show mercy

374
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,960
and let go of my daughter.

375
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,080
She has been

376
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,230
relying on her identity

377
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,630
as Miss Liu these years

378
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,110
to bully us ordinary people.

379
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,270
If I let her go,

380
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,200
isn’t it encouraging bullying?

381
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,360
Lady Divine, you make sense.

382
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
The wicked should be punished
in evil ways.

383
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,030
In my opinion,

384
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,910
we should flog her to death

385
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,080
and parade her body through streets.

386
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,080
Lady Divine, how do you think?

387
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,560
Lady Divine! Please no!

388
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,440
Alright.

389
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,030
During the next 16 days,

390
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,230
you can parade through the streets

391
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
wearing this turtle makeup.

392
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,990
Liu Yuxiang,

393
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,750
if you have a habit of teasing

394
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,030
and bullying others,

395
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,150
you should also experience being

396
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,680
teased and bullied.

397
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,800
I hope you will be able to change

398
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,150
after you feel

399
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,390
other people’s strange eyes

400
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,960
and be able to show kindness

401
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,110
and compassion to others.

402
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,510
Take her away.

403
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,440
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

404
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,960
Lady Divine, you’re so kind.

405
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,910
That really makes me admire.

406
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,720
Mr. Shen, I’m flattered.

407
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,150
It’s getting dark.

408
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,910
My father is still waiting for me.
I’m going home now.

409
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,990
Lady Divine,

410
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,990
don’t worry, His Majesty
has made arrangements.

411
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,680
Your father has now entered the Palace

412
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,320
to be well served.

413
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,510
Then, thank His Majesty.

414
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,990
And, thank you, Mr. Shen.

415
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,080
It’s my pleasure.

416
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
Lady Divine, when will you
enter the Palace?

417
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,630
I should go there, too?

418
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,230
Thanks.

419
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,840
You’re the Dragon King.

420
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,870
But you always hurt yourself

421
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,720
for an ordinary girl.

422
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,800
Is this love
really worth your sacrifice?

423
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,720
My little suffering

424
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,960
can get her life happiness.

425
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,560
It’s worth it.

426
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,440
Looks like you don’t know the truth.

427
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,910
His Majesty ordered

428
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,230
(Imperial Notice)
that if the Lady Divine is found,

429
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,150
she will be awarded with silks,
gold, silver and jewelries,

430
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
and also becomes concubine.

431
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,030
Concubine?

432
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,030
That’s right.

433
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,960
In my opinion, we can’t let
His Majesty wait.

434
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,840
How about entering the Palace now?

435
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,990
Congratulations to Lady Divine!

436
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,910
Congratulations to Lady Divine!

437
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,270
But now, she is marrying the Emperor.

438
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,720
You also want that?

439
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,360
That’s the best result.

440
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,360
Ayu was affected by me before

441
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,750
and got her spirit hurt.

442
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,150
Being the concubine

443
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,560
can make her enjoy the high position
and great wealth.

444
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,800
Also, the noble spirit can cure her.

445
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,150
She could live safe and sound

446
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,080
and pass away peacefully.

447
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,030
That’s what I want her to be like.

448
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,150
That is to say,

449
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,910
deep love

450
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,080
sometimes is sweet

451
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,150
and sometimes is painful.

452
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,140
(Luofeng Pavilion)

453
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,390
I’m so anxious.

454
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,110
Lord just locked me up here.

455
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,600
I don’t know how they are doing now.

456
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,270
You’re back! How is Ayu now?

457
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,390
How did you get hurt like this?

458
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,390
It’s no big deal.

459
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,080
I just need to rest for several days.

460
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,600
Go to Immortal of Fate for medicine.

461
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,560
Yes.

462
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,200
How can I go with this?

463
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,080
You locked Qingqing on the chair?

464
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
It’s for her own good.

465
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,800
I’ll find a chance to try

466
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,990
the equal treatment you said last time.

467
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,870
What happened?

468
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,840
Look at you! Your old wounds
haven’t been healed

469
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,440
and now you got new wounds!

470
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,720
Come with me.

471
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,910
Let me heal you.

472
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,110
I went to ask for medicine.

473
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,560
But Immortal of Fate

474
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,870
asked to come to have a look.

475
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,230
In front of our beloved,

476
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,870
we are not the Dragon King or Lord.

477
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,720
You should put these thoughts aside

478
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,600
and simply get along with her

479
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,230
equally in the way a man

480
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,480
treats a woman.

481
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,390
What’s wrong?

482
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,230
Why do you look at me like that?

483
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,910
I won’t forgive you

484
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,030
for locking me on the chair

485
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,910
even if you look at me like this.

486
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,030
If you really mind it,

487
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,080
you can also lock me up.

488
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,480
Don’t bother.

489
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,960
I know you did that for my own good.

490
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,800
But you could tell me gently.

491
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,030
OK.

492
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,990
Do you want some tea?

493
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,270
You want tea? Let me help you.

494
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,440
No need.

495
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,600
Sit.

496
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,990
Over there.

497
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,680
Chat with me.

498
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,200
Have some tea.

499
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,630
What trick is it this time?

500
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,360
Drink it.

501
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,870
OK.

502
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,440
Qing…

503
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
Sorry! My Lord!

504
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,720
My bad.

505
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,680
It’s fine.

506
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,230
Just sit there.

507
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,600
Let’s continue our chat.

508
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,750
I… I…

509
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,080
I want to use the toilet
because of the tea.

510
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,270
OK.

511
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,750
My Lord, I’m going now.

512
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,030
Does this really work?

513
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,480
I feel my heart beat fast.

514
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,510
But,

515
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,510
she seems to be avoiding me.

516
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,440
Why do Lord’s eyes

517
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,440
make my heart beat so fast?

518
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,480
What? Say it again.

519
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,720
I say

520
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,080
I want Qingqing to accompany Ayu
in the Palace.

521
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,480
I’m the one she should accompany,
not your Ayu!

522
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
I mean

523
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,510
I managed to make Qingqing

524
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,680
sit down, chat

525
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,110
and have tea with me now.

526
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,600
But now you want her
to enter the Palace.

527
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,960
Then we can’t…

528
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,200
Don’t act like

529
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,360
you can’t see each other again.

530
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,390
Qingqing’s power has been
sealed for long.

531
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,110
Now she is just like an ordinary person.

532
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,720
She can freely enter
and leave the Palace.

533
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,480
You are the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

534
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,110
Heavenly Generals guarding the Palace

535
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,440
will never stop you.

536
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,200
You can see each other anytime you want.

537
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,750
But, it’s not same with me.

538
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,200
If I want to see Ayu now,

539
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,270
I have to have a tough fight
with the Generals.

540
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,030
I can’t see her as I wish.

541
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,390
That’s why I’m making this request.

542
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,990
I want Qingqing to take care of Ayu
in the Palace.

543
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,800
In this way, I can keep in touch
with her.

544
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,560
Alright.

545
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,720
I accept it.

546
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,110
Go and see her

547
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,720
before she enters the Palace.

548
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,110
You mean I can go to see Ayu?
