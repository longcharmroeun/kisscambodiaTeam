Come out!

19
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,520
Why can’t these youngsters do some
good deeds?

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,680
What a pity!

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,270
It’s such a cruel thing.

22
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,910
(Human Traffickers)
Yeah. Is he not afraid of retribution?

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,260
(Human Traffickers)
You should be sentenced to death.

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,910
Look! Baldhead is tied up!

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,830

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,960

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,800
Step aside!

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,600
-Make way!
-Sir!

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
We’re wronged, sir!

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,160
We’re innocent!

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,400
Innocent? You’re Baldhead Xu, right?

33
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,160
The trafficker has confessed

34
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,550
that you were going to sell him a girl.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,630
I… I…

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,240
Sir,

37
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,880
I’m the girl he kidnapped.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,160
I’m wronged.

39
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,680
Yuxiang!

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,880
I did all this for you!

41
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,320
You still dare to threaten others
when there is clear evidence?

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,760
Guards! Take him back and have him
flogged for 20 times!

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,680
Yes, sir!

44
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,600
Not like that!

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
It’s not like that! Sir!

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,830
Let her go.

47
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,120
Yuxiang!

48
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,070
Sir, it’s not like that!

49
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,990
(Human Traffickers)
-It’s not like that! -Go!

50
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,600
It’s not the truth!

51
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,830
Let me go!

52
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,070
Yuxiang.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,630
Yuxiang.

54
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,430
Yuxiang.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,680
-Father.
-Are you alright?

56
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,350
I’m fine.

57
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,760
What on earth happened?

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
I don’t know!

59
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,120
On my way home,

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,520
suddenly,

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,910
I got caught by a demon!

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,120
Demon?

63
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,320
But…

64
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,270
How could there be a demon?

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,520
Yuxiang.

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Do you know who got us here?

67
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
I remember!

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,760
He is Qingqing’s brother!

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,680
I met him once in the market.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,990
He… He…

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,190
He is a demon!

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,910
The demon is in Qingqing’s house.

73
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,430
Maybe

74
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,320
Qingqing is also a demon!

75
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,070
What’s going on?

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,350
Why do I feel a danger is coming?

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,070
It even makes my feathers bristle.

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
Something is wrong.
The invader is not friendly.

79
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,350
I have no powers now.

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,870
I can only escape.

81
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,030
My sachet!

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,000
You demon!

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,520
Let’s see where you can go.

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,000
Of course…

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,870
The back door.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
Demon Rope!

87
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,280
Let go of me!

88
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,400
Dragon King!

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Dragon King!

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,560
Dragon King!

91
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,520
Looks like she is already caught by me.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,910
This demon is quite strong.

93
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,070
It’s a good material
for refining the elixir.

94
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,310
Ouch!

95
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,150
I haven’t touched your wound.

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
Really?

97
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,400
Ouch! It hurts!

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,280
If you continue yelling,
I’ll muzzle you.

99
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
My Lord…

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,960
You just can’t be quiet for a moment.

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
No…

102
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,030
I just wonder

103
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,120
why you came

104
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,800
after I cast the Three-call Spell

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,470
of Dragon King.

106
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,310
I changed it when I unsealed you
last time.

107
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,310
-It’s not a right thing…
-Don’t move.

108
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,000
Why did you make decisions

109
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,190
for me without asking me?

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,630
I saved you. And that’s your attitude?

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,560
Alright. Thank you for saving me.

112
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,630
But, I got hurt

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,960
because I went back

114
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
to take the sachet you gave me.

115
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
You care about that sachet?

116
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,120
Of course not.

117
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,560
If you don’t,

118
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,470
I won’t care about it either.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,870
You can go now.

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,630
You’re no longer my maid.

121
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,720
Really?

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,240
I, Xue Qianxun, never tell lies.

123
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,590
Thank you, My Lord!

124
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,240
My Lord.

125
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,950
My Lord.

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,950
You don’t like eating osmanthus cakes.

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,470
Then these

128
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,390
must be for me, right?

129
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
Thank you!

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,760
My Lord! You’re so sweet! I’m leaving!

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
It’s done!

132
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,120
Why am I dizzy again?

133
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,590
Firefly.

134
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,320
Go and bring Yuchi here.

135
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,950
Yuchi! You’re here.

136
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,710
I need to give something back to you.

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,760
What is it?

138
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,150
I see the dragon on your handkerchief
is half embroidered.

139
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,390
So I finished embroidering it on my own.

140
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
Do you like it?

141
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,880
If the Star Halo shows up again
in three days,

142
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
you need to give me a token as well.

143
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,710
Finally I get your token of love.

144
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,150
It’s worth the wait.

145
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,200
You don’t like it?

146
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,510
I like it.

147
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,880
I like it so much.

148
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,510

149

in exchange.

But,

Ayu!

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
Yuchi.

223
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,800
Do you feel better?

224
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,880
I don’t know what’s wrong with me
these days.

225
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,800
Yuchi,

226
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
I fainted in such a beautiful place.

227
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,120
Sorry for spoiling the fun.

228
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,830
Have you been dizzy a lot lately?

229
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,270
Not very often.

230
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,880
Maybe I didn’t get enough sleep.

231
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,470
Yuchi, there are only two fireflies left

232
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,030
that you gave me.

233
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,880
It’s OK.

234
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,390
I’ll give you more.

235
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,560
Thank you, Yuchi.

236
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,680
But you have to promise me

237
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,350
to have enough rest.

238
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,950
Don’t worry.

239
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,440
You still have old scars and new wounds.

240
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,910
What is this thing

241
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,080
you are wasting your energy on?

242
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,320
These fireflies have a connection
with me.

243
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,320
As long as Ayu takes them with her,

244
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,030
she can call me

245
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,840
anytime she misses me.

246
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,630
Give me some, too.

247
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,360
Then I can also call you
when I miss you.

248
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,720
You always come without being invited.

249
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,750
Then, do you want to know

250
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,680
a thing about Ayu?

251
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,230
What is it? Go ahead.

252
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,680
If you don’t give me fireflies,

253
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,560
you have to give me other benefits
for it.

254
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,800
What?

255
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,390
I also want to be served with chestnuts.

256
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,510
Are you breaking me tooth?

257
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,510
Say it.

258
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,510
If you don’t say it now,

259
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,800
I will break all your teeth.

260
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,080
Alright.

261
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,720
I’m just here to remind you

262
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,630
that you’d better

263
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,360
keep a distance with Ayu.

264
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,840
Ayu is just an ordinary people.

265
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,560
Now you’re lack of energy.

266
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,150
You’ll automatically absorb the
mortal energy from Ayu.

267
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,080
What will happen?

268
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,480
Human and demon are different.

269
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,480
She will die.

270
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,360
Why was this not the case
when I was with Liuying?

271
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,150
You had enough energy back then.

272
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,320
And, you didn’t stay together for long

273
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
before she married Xu Zhiyuan.

274
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,840
Now Ayu always falls in a faint.

275
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,200
It’s because of you.

276
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,910
So,

277
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,510
you’d better leave her
as early as possible.

278
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Qingqing!

279
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,230
Qingqing!

280
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,390
Qingqing, they say you’re a bird demon

281
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,600
and you got caught by a demon hunter.

282
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,680
If Qingqing is a demon,

283
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,110
what about Yuchi?

284
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
Firefly, go tell Yuchi

285
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,630
that I have something important

286
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,750
to tell him.

287
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,560
Why hasn’t Yuchi come yet?

288
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,720
Is he caught by the hunter as well?

289
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,440
Yuchi,

290
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,600
you must come back safe and sound.

291
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,510
Qingqing has Three-call Spell
of Xue Qianxun.

292
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,110
You don’t need to worry.

293
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,320
Who is speaking?

294
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
Yuchi!

295
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,440
Yuchi!

296
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,030
Yuchi!

297
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,910
Yuchi!

298
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,390
Yuchi!

299
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,600
Yuchi!

300
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,750
Yuchi!

301
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Where are you?

302
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,270
Did anything bad happen to you?

303
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,270
Yuchi!

304
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,910
Yuchi!

305
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,630
Stop yelling.

306
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,630
-Yuchi…
-Don’t come over.

307
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
You’re all right. It’s fine.

308
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,030
Yuchi,

309
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,030
you are…

310
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,150
This is the Fallen-flower Valley

311
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,600
with many butterflies we came last time.

312
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,910
Yes.

313
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,320
Yuchi,

314
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
you’re really a demon?

315
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
Yes.

316
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,110
Run away now!

317
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,270
It’s dangerous here!

318
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,870
A powerful demon hunter

319
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,230
is finding you everywhere.

320
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,960
People in town said

321
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,910
Qingqing has already been caught.

322
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I’m a demon.

323
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,560
Aren’t you afraid of me?

324
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,680
Who says demons are all bad
and people are all good?

325
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,990
To me, you and Qingqing

326
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,270
are way better than those

327
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,510
who bullied me.

328
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,720
Yuchi,

329
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,110
I saw the little dragon
on your handkerchief…

330
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,030
Are you a dragon demon?

331
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,910
Yes.

332
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,390
Then, fly away now!

333
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,600
Fly to the sky

334
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,560
and then the hunters can’t catch you.

335
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,150
Don’t worry about me and Qingqing.

336
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,630
We’ll all leave here.

337
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,110
Then, can I see…

338
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,630
Her again?

339
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,870
She can’t come to see you.

340
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,150
Neither can I.

341
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,480
Human and demon are different.

342
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,200
Then, you won’t come to see me

343
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,230
even if I free the fireflies, will you?

344
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,630
No, I won’t.

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,630

378

You can make it.

379
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,910
You can make it.

393
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,600
I want to go.

394
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,480
OK, welcome next time.

Really?

402
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,080
(Love with Dragon)
Have a try?

403
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,990
I’ll buy one.

404
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,800
OK. Let me pack it up for you.

405
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,510
Ayu,

406
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,270
what are you looking at fascinatedly?

407
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,110
(Love with Dragon)
This man looks so handsome.

408
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,680
I don’t like this kind of book.

409
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Really?

410
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,630
He has a nice face.

411
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,630
Roast duck! Delicious roast duck!

412
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,840
Flowers!

413
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,750
Fresh beautiful flowers!

414
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,200
Flowers…

415
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,680
I’m trying hard to forget you,

416
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,510
Yuchi.

417
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,390
But you’re everywhere in my life.

418
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,800
Why is it asymmetric again?

419
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,150
How I wish I have Lord’s hands.

420
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,750
It’s unfair!

421
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,680
He is a man!

422
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,750
Why is he so good at making
peach makeup?

423
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,870
It’d be good if he can help me make up
every day.

424
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,440
Or,

425
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,360
if I can have a lot of headwear

426
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,840
and headbands like Xiahou Xue,

427
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,680
I won’t be so upset about it.

428
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,440
This... looks too plain.

429
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,630
This?

430
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,990
Is it too flashy?

431
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,800
Will she like

432
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,720
this color?

433
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,230
So many!

434
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,080
Headwear!

435
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,390
Headbands!

436
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,080
Are these all for me?

437
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,750
Do you like them?

438
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,560
Yes! I like them!

439
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,600
Wait.

440
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,150
He just

441
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,910
dislikes my meteor mark.

442
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,030
Is it really that ugly?

443
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,480
Thank you, My Lord.

444
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,960
But, I don’t want these.

445
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,360
Why do you refuse my gifts for you?

446
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,150
I just don’t want these.

447
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,080
I’ll go to sleep now.

448
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,720
What’s that face?

449
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,720
If you think my meteor mark is ugly,

450
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,870
you can just say it directly.

451
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,080
Why bother to give me gifts?

452
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,800
Not jewelries and headwear?

453
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,030
What Qingqing wants most

454
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,480
is to get rid of the meteor mark
on her forehead.

455
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
