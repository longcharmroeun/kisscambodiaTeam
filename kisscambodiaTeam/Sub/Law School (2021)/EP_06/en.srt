1
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,489
Why are you going home alone?

2
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:20,991
I told you to go with friends.

3
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,618
They're all at the academies.

4
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:25,579
I'm the only one who can't…

5
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:26,788
No one else is free.

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,792
Hang in there.

7
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,711
I'll make lots of money once I graduate

8
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:35,255
and hire the best tutor for you.

9
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,465
I heard even lawyers struggle these days.

10
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,093
Your grades aren't good enough
to join a famous law firm.

11
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,052
What do you mean…

12
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:43,680
You little brat. You're too smart.

13
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:46,266
Hey, I told you
not to use your phone too much.

14
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:47,309
I'll take it away.

15
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,060
Who says you can? It's Dan's.

16
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:52,772
Anyway, Lee Man-ho is really scary.
You have to be careful.

17
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,190
You have the spray, right?

18
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:55,108
Yeah.

19
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:58,028
Don't worry about me. You should study.

20
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:02,574
But he actually looks very different
in person.

21
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,409
The kids may not recognize him.

22
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:07,579
He's so much uglier in person.
He's really creepy.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,956
Okay.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,333
Study hard!

25
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,302
I'm uglier in person?

26
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:27,182
Hey, take a good look.

27
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:29,976
I don't think I'm that ugly.

28
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:37,442
Hey, do you carry that around
because of me?

29
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:39,569
Stay away, or I'll spray you.

30
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,656
Hey, kiddo. I'm not a scary person now.

31
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,284
I don't care what you say.
I am scared, so stay away.

32
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:48,828
You see, I read the laws
instead of the Bible

33
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:50,372
when I was in jail.

34
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,499
You could be charged with assault
if you use--

35
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:22,987
That day,

36
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,867
I brought the sugar packet.

37
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:33,373
I killed him.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,168
Professor Seo Byung-ju.

39
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,097
You finally found me.

40
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:04,988
KANG SOL B

41
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:30,388
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

42
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:32,724
Why are you calling him?

43
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,185
You should've listened to Dad
and stopped yourself.

44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,979
You made me plagiarize it
just to piss Dad off.

45
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:39,939
I did it for your sake, not mine.

46
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,109
What's with you?

47
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:45,320
It's not like he died because of…

48
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:49,699
That is not the case.

49
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,414
Why don't you study with your tutor?

50
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:58,541
I'll call your tutor now.

51
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,935
I'm the one
who got rid of the sugar packet

52
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,481
and stole the laptop.

53
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,151
It was all me.

54
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,743
To frame you.

55
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:42,794
I slipped the drug into his coffee.

56
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:46,214
So you saw him before I did.

57
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,425
And there were two packets of meth.

58
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:56,015
Let's talk sober.

59
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:01,563
I'm totally sober.

60
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:02,814
I was out of my mind--

61
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:04,315
Sounds like a drunken slur.

62
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,817
Let's talk another time.

63
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:10,446
Do you also think I'm a joke?

64
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:16,202
Do you think

65
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,497
I stayed here
because I didn't feel confident

66
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:21,583
that I'd pass the judicial exam?

67
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:42,186
Gosh, I see that he has opened the e-mail.

68
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,521
Give him some time.

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,025
Yeah? Gosh…

70
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:52,697
Hello?

71
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,949
Yes, speaking. I'm Byeol's sister.

72
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:58,244
What? What did you say?

73
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,876
The sex offender information
you received in the mail

74
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,795
cannot be shared like this
even if it's just a photo.

75
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:09,714
This is ridiculous.

76
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,091
My little sister sent it to her classmates

77
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:14,677
so they could all look out
for this rapist.

78
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:17,597
Still, you can't upload this
in a group chat.

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,432
We should beware of this ticking bomb.

80
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,725
Why is it against the law?

81
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,019
Why must I come here for this?

82
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,270
Jeez.

83
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,689
It's just the law.

84
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:27,732
Why yell at me?

85
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,151
You're studying law,

86
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,569
so you must know it well.

87
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,405
Yes, I'm well-versed in defamation law.

88
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,199
But I've never even heard of this.

89
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:37,575
It is there.

90
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:42,121
Article 55, Act on the Protection
of Children Against Sex Offenses.

91
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:44,666
PROHIBITION OF ABUSE
OF INFORMATION FOR DISCLOSURE

92
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,043
See? I told you.

93
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,419
You got this case?

94
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:51,256
Yeah, with my luck.
I don't want to deal with that scum.

95
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:54,676
This is insane. They're prioritizing
the rights of criminals

96
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,552
over children's safety?

97
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:00,181
Darn it!

98
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:03,059
Who are they trying to protect here?

99
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:06,521
Innocent civilians or evil criminals?

100
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:08,481
Join the National Assembly.

101
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:10,984
Actually, let's talk about this photo.

102
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:11,943
How old is this?

103
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,695
You've met Lee Man-ho.

104
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:14,904
He looks so different.

105
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:18,116
You wouldn't recognize him
even if he walked right past you.

106
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,576
-Right.
-Can you find a better photo to use

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,954
-before you catch people who have--
-Why don't you…

108
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:27,959
just tell your cute little sister
to take down that useless photo?

109
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,169
Gosh…

110
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,548
I have to say,
that pepper spray was intense.

111
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,633
The eye doctor said… Oh, boy.

112
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,303
I nearly…

113
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:41,639
Jeez.

114
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:44,183
Do you wish it had been worse?

115
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,060
You can talk to me.

116
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,857
-My sister--
-I didn't do anything!

117
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:53,901
Can't you see?

118
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:56,070
Your sister attacked me.

119
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,784
My gosh.

120
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:05,204
I have to say, you look just like her.

121
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,957
Goodness.

122
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:13,129
Gosh.

123
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:16,090
Hello? Darn it.

124
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,551
I'm being monitored.

125
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:22,972
I am at a police station now,
but not as the assailant.

126
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,266
I'm here as the victim.

127
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:27,977
I'll stay out of trouble.

128
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:30,938
I'll get this sorted out,
so don't book her.

129
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,899
It's not like I want to do this.

130
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:34,901
Why are there so many special laws?

131
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,027
Okay, will do.

132
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,488
Is she really studying law at your school?

133
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,370
I look "just like her"?

134
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,831
That's right.

135
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,291
Just like Kang Dan.

136
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,212
How do you know her?

137
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:58,925
She hasn't been coming home lately.

138
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:00,927
What?

139
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:03,846
INVESTIGATIONS UNIT 1

140
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,057
Have you been watching our home?

141
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,520
-Don't tell me you live--
-I need to talk to Dan

142
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:11,729
about something.

143
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,232
You need to talk to Dan?

144
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,483
About what?

145
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,568
If you're curious, bring her to me.

146
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:20,738
Don't worry about your little sister.

147
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:24,117
Let her go.

148
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,618
Yeah, I'm going to.

149
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,288
Looks like I've accomplished
my goal anyway.

150
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,756
Are you okay?

151
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:40,466
No.

152
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,468
I'm not okay.

153
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:52,186
Just one more drink

154
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:55,606
You know, I…

155
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:03,156
I gave up on the judicial exam
so I could teach.

156
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:05,074
Okay?

157
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,786
My wife always went on about

158
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,539
how Seo Byung-ju passed the exam
on the first try.

159
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:16,711
But I put up with her belittling me
and comparing me with him.

160
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:18,629
Why?

161
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:22,383
Because she's the mother of my child.

162
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:28,014
But when that jerk said to my face
that he could see why

163
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:34,437
my wife regretted marrying me
in that sneering tone,

164
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,606
I just…

165
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,984
couldn't control my anger.

166
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,032
Are you okay, sir?

167
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,082
Your dad's not at school either.

168
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,552
Why didn't you say anything?

169
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,515
I have a sweet tooth.

170
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,601
You needed Prof. Yang
to become the suspect--

171
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:14,518
Enough.

172
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,021
We'll talk at home.

173
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:33,412
What happened…

174
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,391
You two were out together?

175
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,148
What did you two talk about?

176
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:02,775
Ask your dad.

177
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:04,986
Professor Yang.

178
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,113
First, tell him that I saw you.

179
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,329
Yeah.

180
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,999
No.

181
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,792
I said it's fine.

182
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,253
I'll stay with Byeol, Mom.

183
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,213
Don't worry. Just do what you need to do.

184
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:26,340
All right, bye.

185
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,885
You should go home.

186
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,100
It's here.

187
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:39,312
Thanks for today.

188
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:42,023
-Go home.
-What about Lee Man-ho?

189
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:52,450
Sol.

190
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,036
Hey! Bye.

191
00:12:57,788 --> 00:12:59,248
You must be Byeol.

192
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,917
That must've been scary.

193
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:04,462
I'm okay now.

194
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:06,630
What is this now?

195
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:10,259
This is Han Joon-hwi, my schoolmate.

196
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,554
Oh, the second-round passer?

197
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,057
Sol has told me a lot about you.

198
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,892
Hey, what are you talking about?

199
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,604
But you don't seem like
an arrogant show-off.

200
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,398
Oh, I see.

201
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:27,693
I'm not a show-off.
I'm just smart, that's all.

202
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,153
Yes, I see that.

203
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,238
You don't seem like the obnoxious type.

204
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,157
Hey, let's go inside.

205
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,283
-Okay.
-Bye!

206
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,717
You know, that smart guy…

207
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:54,178
He looks familiar.

208
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,847
Come on. Where could you have seen him?

209
00:13:57,556 --> 00:13:59,600
Let's do this for now

210
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:01,018
and put up curtains later.

211
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,230
Byeol.

212
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,649
Are you really okay?

213
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,778
But it must've been so scary.
Get some sleep.

214
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:15,366
Where did I see him?

215
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,389
What happened…

216
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,523
Do you think the reason
she took your laptop

217
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,650
is connected to Professor Seo's death?

218
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:51,902
No, it wasn't her.

219
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:54,739
She was with me when the case broke out.

220
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,415
I killed him.

221
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:06,625
I'm the one
who got rid of the sugar packet

222
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,377
and stole the laptop.

223
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:10,004
It was all me.

224
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,215
Is it me this time?

225
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:24,894
KANG SOL B

226
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,691
You finally found me.

227
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,920
Prof. Yang brought you home.

228
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,303
So he saw you?

229
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,767
Why did you two meet up?

230
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,146
I wanted to tell him
why I walked back my alibi.

231
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:12,233
And? You told him?

232
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:26,288
Now that he knows I'm your daughter,

233
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:28,207
you can just tell him

234
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,750
you couldn't tell the police

235
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,836
that I was with you
to hide our relationship.

236
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:34,755
You can do that, right?

237
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:40,386
Yes.

238
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:42,930
Let's do that, then.

239
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,102
He told me to ask you directly.

240
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:52,356
I asked him what you two talked about.

241
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:54,066
Well…

242
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:56,777
Nothing much, really.

243
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,738
I was too drunk.

244
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:04,535
I don't need to worry, right?

245
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:09,790
Yes.

246
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,418
You know,

247
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:16,797
Mom's not the reason
I want to become a judge.

248
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,682
I'll wear the judge's robe

249
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:29,351
and replace that photo.

250
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:42,114
Some parents would gladly sacrifice
their lives for their children,

251
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,450
but some only show up
after their kids have died.

252
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,912
Let's say someone was abandoned
by their parents as a kid.

253
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:51,123
If they claim their inheritance rights
after the person dies,

254
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:52,207
the law currently…

255
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,044
Hey! The one who's dozing off.

256
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:56,712
Watch your head.

257
00:17:58,255 --> 00:17:59,757
-Just sleep.
-No, it's okay.

258
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,592
It's okay.

259
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:02,968
The current Civil Code isn't

260
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,470
-equipped
-What's wrong with me?

261
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,221
-to stop
-How could you fall asleep?

262
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:09,558
such irresponsible parents
from claiming their inheritance rights.

263
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,896
Even the dog isn't helping.

264
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,282
This stupid dog!

265
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,593
Go home. Go.

266
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,929
Go find your mommy.

267
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:56,814
What are you doing?

268
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:01,735
You two.

269
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,405
What are you doing here?

270
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,044
This really doesn't suit the image
you've built up for yourself.

271
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,799
Everyone has a thing or two
that trigger their past trauma.

272
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,300
That's true.

273
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:30,764
But I must say, that dog was so tiny.

274
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,976
You can't use this as leverage over me.

275
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,728
Don't even dream of it.

276
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:38,689
If you tell anyone, I'll take you to court

277
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,774
-for uttering threats and defamation.
-Sure!

278
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,109
First-hand experience.

279
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:51,118
Teasing you is no fun
because you're so boring.

280
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:56,206
By the way, what were you doing
in front of my place?

281
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:58,584
Were you worried about us?

282
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:03,422
What? For real?

283
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:05,215
You duped me.

284
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,009
What? I duped you?

285
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,179
You sold me the books, remember?

286
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:11,096
What?

287
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,516
I bought them because you said
you were a Hankuk Law senior.

288
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,727
Are you sure I'll get in at once,

289
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,644
Ms. Senior?

290
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:19,021
"Ms. Senior"?

291
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,692
HANKUK UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE

292
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:29,323
Ms. Senior, remember me?

293
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:32,618
Hey, don't you remember me?

294
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,036
Hey.

295
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,370
What? No, I don't.

296
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:37,831
I don't remember you at all.

297
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,962
You were right after all.

298
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,297
You actually got in.

299
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:48,926
You must've felt guilty
lying about being a Hankuk Law student.

300
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,219
Well done.

301
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,305
I have no idea what you're talking about.

302
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:54,306
Hey!

303
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,433
I'm talking!

304
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:00,562
Let go of me.

305
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:02,231
-Let go!
-I said get in.

306
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:03,899
-Get in!
-Let go!

307
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:05,567
-I told you to get in.
-I'm off.

308
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:06,860
Ye-seul!

309
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:10,614
-Sol.
-We're not done talking yet.

310
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,282
Talk another time.

311
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:14,868
-Who's that?
-Stop. He's in my study group.

312
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:16,161
What?

313
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:18,747
I didn't know you had a guy friend.

314
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:20,833
Let's talk in the car.

315
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,961
Let's just go. You seem really upset.

316
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:26,338
Why do you care? She's my girlfriend.

317
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:28,257
Because she's worried about her.

318
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,342
Just talk another day.

319
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:32,928
I'm okay. Just go.

I really don't like him.

328
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,196
Yeah, something feels off.

329
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,573
Just like at the bookstore.

330
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,242
You remember, don't you?

331
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,039
My gosh, Byeol was that smart cookie.

332
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:43,707
You lied about being a law student,

333
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,250
and she turned it into reality.

334
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,310

Why do they need family info?

341
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,339
It's about time they got rid of it.

342
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:38,428
Because it's privately owned.
They want to look at your background.

350
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:11,938
I'd like to speak with you.

351
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:13,982
Sure, take a seat.

352
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:28,497
I forgot to tell you
because I was too flustered.

353
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:32,042
Please don't tell anyone
that I'm Professor Kang's daughter.

354
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,294
The admin office knew about it.

355
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,046
I heard he told them

356
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:39,299
to please keep their lips sealed
so no one would find out.

357
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,927
I asked him to do it.
I didn't want anyone to find out.

358
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,678
I couldn't give up on this school

359
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:46,223
just because of my dad
when my grades were good enough.

360
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:47,682
I had no choice

361
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:50,769
but to take his course
because it was one of the prerequisites.

362
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:54,397
I thought people would know
if I switched courses,

363
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:56,108
so I just took his class.

364
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,902
But I did not receive
any special treatment.

365
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,657
I'm sure this isn't why
you called me last night.

366
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:06,618
That was…

367
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,122
About my dad changing his word

368
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:12,999
and saying he was actually with me--

369
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,293
You were asked about it
in front of the students.

370
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,504
Worried that they'd find out
about your dad,

371
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:19,339
you couldn't tell the cops the truth.

372
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:20,799
Correct.

373
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,009
All he did was back up my statement.

374
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:25,971
But you accused me of plagiarism.

375
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,722
That's why he told me the truth?

376
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,267
Yes.

377
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:33,895
Hey, I went through these…

378
00:26:34,396 --> 00:26:35,564
Oh, sorry.

379
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:36,690
I'll leave.

380
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:38,400
-No, it's not urgent.
-I'm done.

381
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:39,484
It's really okay.

382
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:45,407
I think she plagiarized it.

383
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,995
Let's say she wrote this in middle school.

384
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,000
The problem is,
the contest took place ten years later,

385
00:26:56,293 --> 00:27:00,338
so there were many new theories
and cases she could've referred to.

386
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:04,050
If she was smart enough to write that
in middle school,

387
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,887
do you think she'd copy and paste it

388
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:09,347
and submit it to the contest

389
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:11,641
without updating it
after entering law school?

390
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:17,230
Why did she do this?

391
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:21,234
She didn't need the award.

392
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:23,486
Even without that,
she was qualified to get in.

393
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:37,709
What are you going to do?

394
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:48,470
Would she want to kill me
if I took issue with it?

395
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:50,847
Why? Did she say that?

396
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:54,851
Well, her admission could be revoked
because of it.

397
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:56,686
Hold on.

398
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,898
-Do you think Kang Sol B--
-How would her parents feel?

399
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:04,945
Judging from what her mom has done
to sort out the mess…

400
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,322
Right, they would want to kill you.

401
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:12,410
If Prof. Seo wanted
to take issue with it...

402
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:14,746
What are you trying to get at?

403
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:17,457
My gosh! You found your laptop?

404
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,293
When? Where was it? How did you find it?

405
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:23,338
How far would you go
for the sake of your child?

406
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:26,466
I could die.

407
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,927
Would you kill someone?

408
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,011
Kill someone?

409
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:45,026
I heard…

410
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,779
you saw my daughter.

411
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:54,619
She wanted to know
what you told me last night.

412
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,706
Please don't tell her anything.

413
00:28:58,373 --> 00:29:00,625
I'll turn myself in
before the end of the week,

414
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:03,211
so just until then.

415
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:07,507
The police would have nothing
but your confession.

416
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:10,427
You know they can't do anything
without evidence.

417
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:15,599
-The cup--
-You slipped a drug into his coffee?

418
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:18,768
Then you discarded the cup
and the empty sachet outside.

419
00:29:19,352 --> 00:29:22,564
You drugged his coffee
before the mock trial began.

420
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,482
But then, he couldn't have conducted it.

421
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,484
He didn't drink it right away.

422
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:30,363
He drank it during the break.

423
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:33,700
Can you prove it?

424
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:39,664
There's no evidence or witness
to back up your statement.

425
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:43,084
Can you be convicted when my prints
were found in three different places?

426
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,839
The prosecution is hoping
that I get convicted.

427
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:50,300
-Professor Yang.
-My point is,

428
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:51,676
you turning yourself in

429
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,763
won't really help me prove my innocence.

430
00:29:58,683 --> 00:29:59,643
Then…

431
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:09,486
Attend my trial tomorrow.

432
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:19,454
Professor Yang.

433
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:22,457
-You forgot this.
-Oh.

434
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:26,086
Are you good with computers?

435
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:28,088
Sorry?

436
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,757
How did you figure out the password
to my laptop?

437
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,133
It seems suspicious.

438
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:34,886
Oh, that.

439
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:37,097
There are many companies
that specialize in it.

440
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,642
Good to know.

441
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:50,735
Oh, there he is.

442
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:54,572
I can barely see his face
because of the cap and the mask.

443
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:57,075
I don't think he lives on campus.

444
00:30:57,492 --> 00:30:59,244
Hold on, just before that.

445
00:30:59,327 --> 00:31:00,161
Rewind it?

446
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:12,090
Is it another ransomware attack
like last time?

447
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:15,218
It was working fine earlier.

448
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:17,095
Did you back up everything?

449
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:19,889
Did I back up…
Yes, I followed your instructions.

450
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:22,934
Do I have to wipe everything
and reinstall all the programs?

451
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:25,437
Gosh, I'll have a meltdown
if I have to do that.

452
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:27,188
Don't worry. I got this.

453
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:34,946
JU-YEONG

454
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,907
It's okay even if it doesn't happen.
Just relax.

455
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:41,202
We can be happy without a baby…

456
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:44,706
That's not what I meant.
What I'm saying is…

457
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:47,500
We don't have to have a baby.

458
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:50,920
Okay.

459
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:52,881
All right.

460
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,721
Are you the one who dropped off my laptop
at the security office?

461
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:06,394
Seung-jae, they've just announced
the details of the court internship.

462
00:32:06,478 --> 00:32:07,479
Really?

463
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:09,731
Which one will you apply for?

464
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:10,857
The court, right?

465
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:16,362
I wish my grades were good enough
for the court internship.

466
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:17,280
COURT INTERNSHIP

467
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:19,073
Sol B will get the internship, right?

468
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:20,325
She wants to be a judge.

469
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:23,286
My roommate's grades
are definitely good enough.

470
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,288
Gosh, I'm jealous.

471
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:28,333
Why not impersonate her?
You have the same name.

472
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,334
What?

473
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:33,379
Look at you getting all worked up.
It means you remember.

474
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,548
Fine, I remember. So what?

475
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:37,175
Hey, why are you getting angry?

476
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:39,886
Can't you tell that
I don't want to be reminded of it?

477
00:32:42,013 --> 00:32:43,056
So drop it, okay?

478
00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:48,937
Hey, Byeol.

479
00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:53,107
You remembered what?
Do you have nothing better to do?

480
00:32:53,191 --> 00:32:54,776
Just don't run into that neighbor.

481
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,361
Tell her I'm happy we met again.

482
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:59,948
Attend Prof. Yang's trial with me
if you want to go to the court.

483
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:00,907
I can go alone.

484
00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:04,869
What's up with you two?

485
00:33:08,081 --> 00:33:08,915
Hey.

486
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,250
REGARDING THE BAD FAMA CASE

487
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,001
I'm picking up the photocopies.

488
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:13,378
The pretty girl has them.

489
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,922
Me? When did you give them to me?

490
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:19,467
You wrote this?

491
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,723
Gosh, I should've just said
I couldn't do it.

492
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:29,060
I want to pull my hair out
because of those red lines.

493
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:32,772
Why would you pull your hair out?
Yang underlined the good parts.

494
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:35,358
What? For real?

495
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:37,318
Let me see.

496
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:39,904
He underlined most of it.

497
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:40,989
My goodness.

498
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:44,284
For real?

499
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:02,760
My gosh, it must be so nice to study here.

500
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,053
What an eye candy.

501
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,473
-What?
-"Eye candy"?

502
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:09,183
What's wrong with it?

503
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:12,604
Ye-seul, was that sexually inappropriate?

504
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,024
You think I'm pretty.

505
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:16,941
See?

506
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,528
Right, some girls may have never heard
such a compliment.

507
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:22,614
Now, that's insulting, right?

508
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:25,658
Ye-seul! I haven't seen you in a while…

509
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,036
I've gotten prettier, right?

510
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,079
All thanks to my beau, I guess?

511
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,333
She means, "Don't even dream of it."

512
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,667
You too.

513
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,462
Aren't you tired
of eyeing our study guides?

514
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:39,589
You never let me see it.

515
00:34:39,672 --> 00:34:42,008
Can't you share it with me just once?

516
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,260
If I bomb my finals,

517
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:46,971
I'll be so embarrassed.

518
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:50,141
You've been there,
so you know what it's like.

519
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,059
Hey!

520
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:06,658
Got anything to say to me?

521
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:09,327
No.

522
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:26,219
What are you doing? Why take it down?

523
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:30,640
What are you doing?

524
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:31,641
And what is this?

525
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,267
Why would you…

526
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:36,562
APPOINTMENT FOR KANG SOL

527
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:37,897
I booked it.

528
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:40,274
Go see the psychiatrist with Sol.

529
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,694
What the heck are you doing?

530
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,905
-Get a grip!
-Look who's talking.

531
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:48,366
What did you do
just so Sol could become a judge?

532
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:52,161
Even if I've done something crazy,

533
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:54,580
you can't do this to me.

534
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:56,207
It's all your fault!

535
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,043
You should take responsibility
for all of it, if anything!

536
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,587
You're right.

537
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,965
It's my fault.
I will take responsibility for it.

538
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,177
So take Sol to the doctor
unless you want to mess her up.

539
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,138
Why would I mess her up?

540
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:11,264
That won't happen!

541
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:15,476
Honey.

542
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,187
Our daughter…

543
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,814
What about her?

544
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:21,774
She's doing fine.

545
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,735
Nothing's wrong with her.

546
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:24,986
Stop driving me nuts.

547
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:26,154
I told you it's fine.

548
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:29,615
Since you failed to become a judge--

549
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:30,533
Our daughter…

550
00:36:32,076 --> 00:36:33,286
does not

551
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:35,747
deserve it.

552
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,168
Have you lost your mind?

553
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,215
You should see a psychiatrist.

554
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:00,938
Hankuk University law professor
Yang Jong-hoon's first trial

555
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,273
will begin shortly.

556
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:04,400
He's been consistently denying
his charges,

557
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:07,320
so a fierce court battle is expected.

558
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:12,742
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S FIRST TRIAL

559
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:15,787
The court is now in session.

560
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,331
Prosecution, please arraign Mr. Yang.

561
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,712
Yang Jong-hoon is charged
that he murdered Seo Byung-ju, the victim,

562
00:37:24,796 --> 00:37:29,926
contrary to Article 250.1
of the Criminal Code.

563
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:34,931
Defendant.

564
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:36,599
How do you plead to this charge?

565
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:37,892
Not guilty.

566
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:41,938
-You plead not guilty?
-Correct.

567
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:43,856
Thank you.

568
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,525
Defense counsel.

569
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:47,902
Your Honor, I request that the defendant

570
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:50,780
be placed under arrest before we move on.

571
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:53,282
Did you not get
the arrest warrant canceled?

572
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,826
At the time…

573
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:57,787
we had no choice
since we were misinformed.

574
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:00,998
But now that we know we were misinformed,

575
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,501
the reasons for his arrest
are still valid.

576
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:06,003
Since he is a former prosecutor
and a law professor,

577
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,172
he is well-versed in criminal procedure.

578
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:10,258
He's highly likely
to tamper with evidence.

579
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:14,178
Most notably, his laptop…

580
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:17,140
I was going to present this later.

581
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:20,852
Here is my laptop, which you've been
desperately looking for.

582
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:23,229
Analyze the data, fingerprints,
and take it apart.

583
00:38:23,312 --> 00:38:24,355
Do whatever you want.

584
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:32,738
Let's just do this.

585
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:37,034
Let's just pretend we take it seriously,
or your dad will do something crazy.

586
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,748
He'll quit his job?

587
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:46,127
KANG SOL

588
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,129
Prof. Yang found his laptop.

589
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:49,755
-What? Really?
-He submitted it.

590
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,309
MY DAUGHTER

591
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:03,060
COMPOSE MESSAGE

592
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:05,229
DAD

593
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,148
I'm in court. Can't talk now.

594
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:08,774
I hope the session goes well.

595
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:09,692
PICK UP

596
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:10,651
Pick up.

597
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:13,821
DAD

598
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:15,281
DAD

599
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:17,408
The call cannot be connected.

600
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:20,828
Did Dad say anything else?

601
00:39:20,912 --> 00:39:22,705
-Like what?
-Why does he want to resign?

602
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:23,706
Because you…

603
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,334
Never mind.

604
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:28,669
Come on. We'll be late.

605
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:30,588
What were you going to say? Say it.

606
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:35,259
Sol! Kang Sol!

607
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,136
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

608
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,099
Why did you look up

609
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,018
lethal dose of meth and how to get it?

610
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:47,730
I told you I left your laptop
on Prof. Kang's desk.

611
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:48,648
By his desk lamp.

612
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:53,277
Is Witness Kang Ju-man here?

613
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:54,695
WITNESS

614
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:55,613
Yes.

615
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:57,114
WITNESS

616
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:00,868
You said Prof. Kang kept asking you
if it really was my laptop.

617
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:04,080
That's right. I'm not sure why,
but he asked me several times.

618
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:06,332
Are you sure this is Kang Sol B's laptop?

619
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:09,877
I told him it was yours.
I said you didn't want to hand it over.

620
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,095
Prof. Kang takes the stand.

621
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:21,847
"Oath.

622
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,643
I solemnly affirm
that I will tell the whole truth

623
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:27,645
and nothing but the truth.

624
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:29,855
I understand that I would be…

625
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:37,321
committing perjury
if I said anything untruthful."

626
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,202
WITNESS

627
00:40:45,454 --> 00:40:47,873
Prosecution, you may conduct
your direct examination.

628
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,726
You were in your office
at the time of the incident

629
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:11,314
and you never saw the sugar packet,
which was supposedly

630
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:14,442
at the scene that day,
according to the defendant.

631
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,612
This is what you told the prosecution,
correct?

632
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:22,325
Yes.

633
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:24,744
Your Honor.

634
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:28,080
The witness has verified
the authenticity of the statement made

635
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:29,707
in a particularly reliable state.

636
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,708
DICTIONARY

637
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,711
And since the defendant
has the right to cross-examine him,

638
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:36,130
this statement is considered
admissible evidence

639
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,049
despite the defendant's objection--

640
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:38,966
No.

641
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,884
JUDGE

642
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:42,720
-What?
-What?

643
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:43,804
What's going on?

644
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:44,889
-What now?
-My gosh.

645
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:48,559
I…

646
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:50,853
lied.

647
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:52,271
-What?
-About what?

648
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:59,403
Witness, so you're walking back
your statement?

649
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:03,491
Yes.

650
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:05,826
-What's going on?
-What did he lie about?

651
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,829
Which part of this is untrue?

652
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,623
The sugar packet.

653
00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:13,125
It was there.

654
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:14,627
-What?
-My gosh.

655
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,003
What is happening?

656
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:17,046
WITNESS

657
00:42:18,464 --> 00:42:19,715
I know because…

658
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:22,593
it was mine.

659
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:24,678
What?

660
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:26,222
-What?
-What does he mean?

661
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:27,807
What is going on?

662
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:33,604
I bet you knew about this.

663
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,398
You can't do this!

664
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:38,484
All these questions are useless now.

665
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:41,737
I rest my case.

666
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:45,533
He wants to stop things
from going in Prof. Yang's favor.

667
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:50,663
Counsel,
you may cross-examine the witness.

668
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,167
ACCUSED

669
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:56,335
Yes, Your Honor.

670
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:16,522
Witness.

671
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:18,065
Why…

672
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:19,942
did you lie?

673
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:23,279
Why?

674
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,157
WITNESS

675
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:31,495
I suppose I wanted people
to suspect Professor Yang.

676
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:32,663
-What?
-What?

677
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,248
-But why?
-What's he saying?

678
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,335
Right, but why?

679
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:43,048
That's…

680
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:46,510
Was there a reason you needed him
to be suspected of the murder?

681
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:49,972
Yes, there was.

682
00:43:50,055 --> 00:43:50,973
-What?
-My gosh.

683
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:52,141
What is going on?

684
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:57,188
-It's…
-What was the reason?

685
00:43:58,314 --> 00:44:01,108
Unless you're the one
who killed Seo Byung-ju…

686
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:02,234
Objection, Your Honor.

687
00:44:03,152 --> 00:44:03,986
Just a moment.

688
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:05,029
JUDGE

689
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:06,071
Please continue.

690
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:10,451
Did you…

691
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,078
kill him?

692
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:25,799
I would like to

693
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:28,260
apologize to the victim.

694
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:31,013
-I killed--
-No.

695
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:33,599
No, Dad. Stop.

696
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:36,060
-"Dad"?
-Who's that?

697
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:38,771
What is this?

698
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:39,688
ACCUSED

699
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:42,691
KANG SOL B

700
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:44,109
Oh, I'm sorry.

701
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,405
I meant to hang up but must've pressed
the speakerphone button instead.

702
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:50,407
KANG SOL B

703
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:53,577
Your Honor,
this is considered contempt of court--

704
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:54,578
That is not true.

705
00:44:55,704 --> 00:44:59,291
I'm the one who should be most excited
to hear him say he killed the victim.

706
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:01,043
Am I wrong?

707
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:04,546
Defendant, please be careful.

708
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,133
Counsel, you may continue.

709
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:09,051
Yes, Your Honor.

710
00:45:13,305 --> 00:45:14,223
Witness.

711
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,017
Please finish your sentence.

712
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:21,397
Witness.

713
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:24,608
Yes.

714
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:29,655
-I'm the one who--
-Professor Kang.

715
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:36,912
I think you should listen
to your daughter.

716
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:41,125
What is this?

717
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,167
Please be seated.

718
00:46:00,185 --> 00:46:01,812
My goodness.

719
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,105
She's his daughter?

720
00:46:03,856 --> 00:46:06,150
Darn it. He obviously knew.
Why didn't he tell me?

721
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:09,278
Why must he make me look like an idiot?
Goodness.

722
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:10,821
You shouldn't be upset.

723
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,406
He has the upper hand now.

724
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:15,576
Still, this is unacceptable!
His attorney had no idea.

725
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:16,994
You fool.

726
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:19,997
You're all annoyed just because
the trial didn't go as expected.

727
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,790
How could I not be annoyed?

728
00:46:21,874 --> 00:46:23,667
I didn't know he had found his laptop.

729
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,961
Where did he find it?

730
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:29,465
"I think you should listen
to your daughter."

731
00:46:29,548 --> 00:46:30,716
When did you find out

732
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:32,676
that your roommate is his daughter?

733
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,303
What? Well…

734
00:46:34,386 --> 00:46:36,305
What? Was it a shot in the dark?

735
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:38,390
Why does it matter?

736
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:42,061
We all heard his daughter say,
"No, Dad. Stop."

737
00:46:42,644 --> 00:46:43,645
Then he should stop.

738
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,939
Parents should listen to their kids.

739
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:49,234
The fact that he's her father
isn't important.

740
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:50,986
What matters is why he did it.

741
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:56,909
Just a minute.

742
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,251
You thought…

743
00:47:08,837 --> 00:47:10,672
I stole Prof. Yang's laptop, didn't you?

744
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:15,761
I thought you stole it, Dad.

745
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:20,432
The sugar packet too.

746
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:23,310
You thought I got rid of it.

747
00:47:23,394 --> 00:47:24,478
Then why

748
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:26,647
didn't you say anything?

749
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,316
You said you saw this.

750
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,825
And you meant I should turn myself in.

751
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:39,785
What will you do with your made-up alibi?

752
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:42,621
Prof. Yang will see the police record.

753
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:44,623
Let's not do this.

754
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,668
-Let's turn--
-No, not that.

755
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:49,628
-I don't want my life to end here.
-Sol.

756
00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:51,338
You said it was your fault.

757
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:56,051
You walked back your alibi because of me.

758
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:00,722
You're withdrawing his testimony?

759
00:48:00,806 --> 00:48:04,143
This cross-examination is pointless
now that we can't trust his testimony.

760
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:05,477
It's pointless?

761
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:08,147
To the defendant, it's not.
That's why you're doing this.

762
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,274
Even after taking an oath
to tell the truth,

763
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:12,526
he tried to lie.
Hence, it should be withdrawn.

764
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:13,610
Is this possible?

765
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:16,947
The witness is already
being cross-examined.

766
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,949
You can't just nullify the whole thing.

767
00:48:19,658 --> 00:48:20,909
He can't, right?

768
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:23,871
You have no authority to--

769
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:25,956
The cross-examination
hasn't been completed.

770
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:30,127
There's a special reason
the witness couldn't be trusted.

771
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,378
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

772
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,132
"Did you kill him?"

773
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:38,802
If you asked me that even just once,

774
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:41,763
we wouldn't be here now.

775
00:48:46,185 --> 00:48:47,227
-Sol.
-But then again,

776
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:50,314
I couldn't ask you either.

777
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,031
I didn't do it.

778
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:02,951
You don't need to lie in court for me.

779
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:20,052
But he said he indeed saw
the sugar packet.

780
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:22,387
He tried to lie to us
that he killed the victim.

781
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:23,472
How do we trust him?

782
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,975
That's… Well, he has no reason
to lie about the sugar packet.

783
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:28,644
Because, if that was also a lie,

784
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:30,646
he'd be prosecuted for perjury.

785
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:34,233
And he'd lose his job
as a Hankuk Law professor.

786
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:40,322
The part about the sugar packet
is admissible.

787
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:46,578
As the prosecutor mentioned,
the cross-examination isn't over yet.

788
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:51,416
Witness testimony should be considered
as a whole.

789
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,086
So even if the witness
gave a false statement,

790
00:49:54,169 --> 00:49:56,129
it is not considered perjury
if the witness

791
00:49:56,213 --> 00:49:58,840
withdraws or corrects the statement
during the examination.

792
00:49:58,924 --> 00:49:59,758
PROSECUTION

793
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:01,969
Need the case number?

794
00:50:02,052 --> 00:50:03,887
Case number 2008D1053.

795
00:50:06,306 --> 00:50:07,224
My point exactly.

796
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:11,144
If the part about the sugar packet
is also false, he may withdraw it.

797
00:50:11,228 --> 00:50:13,355
Witness, would you like to withdraw it?

798
00:50:14,856 --> 00:50:16,316
-Well--
-Your Honor.

799
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,776
I request this be aborted.

800
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:20,862
He gave a false statement.
We should reevaluate his credibility.

801
00:50:20,946 --> 00:50:23,949
-If he's deemed disqualified--
-The counsel can bring him in again.

802
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:25,576
If he is deemed disqualified,

803
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:27,452
we will bring him in as our witness.

804
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,204
The prosecutor won't trust them.

805
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:30,789
Their witness can't be trusted.

806
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:33,750
Order.

807
00:50:36,044 --> 00:50:39,381
We will not cancel our decision
on the witness.

808
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:44,261
However, the court agrees
with the prosecution

809
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:47,014
that his credibility as a witness
should be reevaluated.

810
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:50,684
You are a legal scholar,

811
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:53,854
so I'm sure you're aware
that perjury is a serious offense

812
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:57,691
as it can result
in miscarriages of justice.

813
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:00,152
JUDGE

814
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:01,862
The cross-examination may continue,

815
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:05,365
but the court will determine
whether or not

816
00:51:06,158 --> 00:51:08,910
his testimony could be trusted.

817
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:13,874
So they don't trust him.

818
00:51:36,521 --> 00:51:38,023
Thank you for stopping my dad.

819
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:43,111
Prosecution, you may conduct
your direct examination.

820
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:44,655
ACCUSED

Witness.

KANG SOL B
SPEAKER

827
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:00,337
You were in your office
at the time of the incident…

828
00:52:01,922 --> 00:52:03,090
Sol A did, not me.

829
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:06,885
Dad and I could
clear up misunderstandings, thanks to you.

830
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,763
Misunderstandings…

831
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,641
I wonder why your dad thought that of you.

832
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:16,561
There could've been various reasons,
but this is a murder case.

833
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:19,064
It's not easy to suspect your own child.

834
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:23,193
If you're grateful to me, be honest.

835
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:25,946
He must've suspected you
because there was a strong motive.

836
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:29,324
Does your husband know?

837
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:32,577
How did you end up like this?

838
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,746
I told Dad

839
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,083
I wanted Professor Seo gone.

840
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:43,171
I also told him that
I couldn't stand seeing Mom belittling him

841
00:52:44,005 --> 00:52:45,590
and comparing him to Prof. Seo.

842
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:48,927
That's enough to kill someone?

843
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,970
No.

844
00:52:52,347 --> 00:52:53,390
That's why it's not me.

845
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:06,778
So she's still denying plagiarism.

846
00:53:08,196 --> 00:53:09,281
What a shame.

847
00:53:09,906 --> 00:53:12,033
The sugar packet is useless now.

848
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:16,580
The court won't accept
Mr. Kang's testimony.

849
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:18,999
But I guess you do.

850
00:53:19,082 --> 00:53:21,126
Seeing how you found me
just to tell me that.

851
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:22,919
No.

852
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:29,509
I just wanted to tell you that
you'd never be able to bring me to trial.

853
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:32,220
You'll be notified soon.

854
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:35,140
See you next time.

855
00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:49,196
PROSECUTOR LEE HAN-JU HAS BEEN
ASSIGNED TO CASE 2020-HJ1244

856
00:53:58,038 --> 00:53:59,247
-Oh, who is he?
-What?

857
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:00,832
Get him on the camera!

858
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,750
What?

859
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,460
-What is this about?
-Hold on.

860
00:54:03,543 --> 00:54:04,753
-Hey!
-Who is he?

861
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:07,005
No idea.

862
00:54:07,088 --> 00:54:08,131
Then why take photos?

863
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:09,841
Because he looks creepy.

864
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:11,384
-Jeez.
-Come on.

865
00:54:11,468 --> 00:54:13,094
-You fool.
-Look! Over there!

866
00:54:13,178 --> 00:54:14,429
-My gosh!
-There he is!

867
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:19,017
-Why did you lie?
-Why did you lie?

868
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,060
Why did you do that?

869
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:21,394
Just a comment, please.

870
00:54:21,478 --> 00:54:22,562
Stop, please!

871
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:24,356
-Mr. Kang.
-A comment, please.

872
00:54:24,439 --> 00:54:26,191
-Mr. Kang!
-Anything you'd like to say?

873
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:27,567
Just a comment, please!

874
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:42,207
So Professor Kang is your father?

875
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:44,125
Can we talk another time?

876
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:45,794
-So tired that--
-I get it.

877
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:47,879
It would've been such a headache
to tell us.

878
00:54:48,463 --> 00:54:51,049
Exactly. If you guys don't get it,
then who would?

879
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:52,092
We study together.

880
00:54:52,175 --> 00:54:54,261
That's why my feelings are hurt.

881
00:54:54,344 --> 00:54:56,638
-How could you hide it--
-You could do that.

882
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:00,308
It doesn't mean you can interrogate
someone like this.

883
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:05,689
Just try to understand.

884
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:07,232
What's with her?

885
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:09,734
I can't believe she's shielding you.

886
00:55:10,402 --> 00:55:13,488
Oh, she wants to curry favor with you
because of your dad.

887
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:14,447
Me?

888
00:55:14,531 --> 00:55:16,449
I'm sure the entire school knows now.

889
00:55:18,702 --> 00:55:19,536
Here, look.

How did you know I didn't do it?

How far would you go
for the sake of your child?

898
00:56:24,476 --> 00:56:25,310
I could die.

899
00:56:26,478 --> 00:56:27,771
Would you kill someone?

900
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:28,688
Kill someone?

That I'm not sure.

902
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,795
Then could he have killed someone?

903
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:08,228
About my laptop.

904
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:11,314
I had never set a password.

905
00:57:27,038 --> 00:57:28,581
Why didn't you say it's not you?

906
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:29,666
What do you mean?

907
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,003
Oh, that.

908
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:35,088
Let them think what they want.

909
00:57:35,714 --> 00:57:38,717
When else would I get to be
a Hankuk Law professor's daughter?

910
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:42,012
-They'll gossip like crazy.
-They'll find out soon.

911
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:44,472
I'll be his daughter just until then.

912
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:45,432
Goodness.

913
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:49,102
My roommate has more than enough
on her plate now,

914
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:51,688
so she can deal with the gossip later.

915
00:57:53,732 --> 00:57:55,734
By the way, why did the vice dean

916
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:57,652
try to lie that he killed Professor Seo?

917
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:00,780
That is perjury.

918
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:04,826
It must've had something to do
with my roommate.

919
00:58:07,454 --> 00:58:09,497
Is she a law-ciopath?

920
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:14,294
Forget what I just said.

921
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,964
I'm saying crazy things
because of the psychopath I saw.

922
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:21,176
What do you want?

923
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:25,263
I told you.

924
00:58:26,556 --> 00:58:28,099
Bring Kang Dan to me.

925
00:58:28,683 --> 00:58:30,685
I haven't seen her for almost five years.

926
00:58:31,603 --> 00:58:34,314
She cut all ties with us.
Why are you looking for her?

927
00:58:37,734 --> 00:58:38,777
To find my son.

928
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:41,321
Apparently,

929
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,574
that psychopath is looking for my sister
to find his son.

930
00:58:46,284 --> 00:58:48,828
Gosh, what nonsense…

931
00:58:51,664 --> 00:58:53,375
I had a twin sister.

932
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:55,668
The owner of this?

00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:57,045
YOUR GUIDE TO LEET

934
00:58:57,128 --> 00:58:59,047
-How…
-You left it that day.

935
00:58:59,672 --> 00:59:01,674
I read it because you said
it was very good.

936
00:59:02,717 --> 00:59:04,844
Just throw it out.
I don't need it anymore.

937
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:06,930
Look inside.

938
00:59:15,605 --> 00:59:16,564
What is this?

939
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:19,109

Hello?

This is Kang Dan.

SPEAKER

956
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:25,443
Please tell me

957
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:27,946
if there's something I don't know
between you and Dan.

958
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:29,197
Can you handle it?

959
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,824
Prof. Yang is even eviler than Lee Man-ho.

960
01:01:31,908 --> 01:01:34,577
-He's the devil.
-More into something else than the trial.

961
01:01:34,661 --> 01:01:37,372
I have to meet her sister.

962
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:39,165
Wait. What's your name?

963
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:41,417
It's absurd
to say Prof. Seo wrote the paper.

964
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:42,919
How despicable.

965
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:44,045
Why me?

966
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:46,130
I needed your help for my revenge.

967
01:01:46,214 --> 01:01:49,050
You wanted to put Professor Seo
in the dock?

968
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:52,220
What other deal did you make?
You better not mess with my student.

969
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:55,682
How dare Yang Jong-hoon
cast the bait at me?

970
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:58,059
-He has to be put away.
-I got an ace up my sleeve,

971
01:01:58,142 --> 01:02:00,228
so he'll never get away with it tomorrow.

972
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:02,772
I request another witness
be brought in. I found

973
01:02:02,855 --> 01:02:04,148
an eyewitness who saw

974
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:05,692
the defendant kill Seo Byung-ju.
