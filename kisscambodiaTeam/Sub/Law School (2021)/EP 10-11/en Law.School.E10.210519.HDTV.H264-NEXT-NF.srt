LAW SCHOOL

00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,728
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS, CASES
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:25,271

DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

6
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:28,691
When will your attorney get here?

00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:32,486
PROSECUTION

8
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:34,280
They already seem half-hearted.

9
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,448
She's already in a tight spot.

10
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,784
-I'll go outside and check.
-Okay.

11
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:50,796
I apologize.

12
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:54,883
COURT

00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:57,678
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

14
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,304
COURT

15
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:01,724
No way.

16
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:02,641
What's going on?

17
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:04,518
Prof. Yang is defending her?

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,145
Is that allowed?

19
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:08,147
Your Honor.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,607
In order for the defendant
to be fairly judged

21
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:12,484
by the Court and the people,

22
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:15,988
I would like to request a jury trial.

23
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:22,536
"A counsel shall be appointed
from among attorneys-at-law.

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,414
In special circumstances,
courts other than the Supreme Court

25
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:27,249
-What's up?
-may permit the appointment

26
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,668
of a counsel
who is not an attorney-at-law."

27
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,378
Special defense counsel.

28
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:33,547
-This sounds--
-It won't work.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,007
What? Why not?

30
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,258
They won't approve this.

31
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,469
I bet many judges don't even know
about this.

32
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:41,138
This is their chance to learn.
Why won't they approve it?

33
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,682
It was only relevant
back when there were few lawyers.

34
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,642
It cost a fortune to hire a lawyer then.

35
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,646
Nowadays, there are so many of them.
Public defenders too.

36
00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:51,523
The chances are very slim.

37
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:54,860
As you've heard, all the public defenders
who were appointed have quit.

38
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,072
Well, I need my prof's
permission first anyway.

39
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,366
Prof. Kim will say yes, obviously.

40
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:02,493
What? I'm not talking about Prof. Kim.

41
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,419
COURT

42
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:15,047
Mr. Yang Jong-hoon is currently
being tried for murder--

43
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,508
All defendants are innocent
until proven guilty.

44
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:21,053
Law professors are not permitted
to practice law.

45
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:23,931
Based on Article 31
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

46
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:26,475
I've been appointed
as her special defense counsel.

47
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,986
There have been no precedents for decades.

48
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,114
That does not mean the clause isn't there.

49
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:43,075
With all the practicing attorneys,
it is no longer--

50
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:46,036
It was deemed relevant by the Court.

51
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:49,248
What are her extraordinary circumstances?

52
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:52,209
The victim's father is Assemblyman Ko,
a presidential candidate.

53
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:55,462
No one wants to represent Ms. Jeon
because Assemblyman Ko

54
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:56,422
is a powerful man.

55
00:02:57,131 --> 00:03:00,843
So she chose me in order to exercise
her right to defend herself.

56
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:03,345
Yang Jong-hoon?

57
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:07,724
The Court approved it?

58
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:11,061
The judge approved it?

59
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,566
The presiding judge and I
used to work closely together.

60
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:18,485
The public defenders kept quitting,
so he was all stressed out.

61
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,154
How do you know that?

62
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,782
<i>All right. We can't help it, then.</i>

63
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,451
<i>Any lawyer would be up for this?</i>

64
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:27,786
<i>If I can't take this case,</i>
<i>it means no one will.</i>

65
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,123
<i>Why would we destroy our career</i>
<i>by defying Ko Hyeong-su?</i>

66
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,253
Ye-seul wants me to represent her.

67
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,381
So you'll quit teaching?

68
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,052
REQUEST FOR SPECIAL DEFENSE COUNSEL

69
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,179
This is…

70
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:48,390
I've been told that they normally
would not approve this.

71
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,476
If you were the judge,

72
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,396
would you deem her circumstances
"extraordinary"?

73
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,400
-I would.
-Then,

74
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:02,863
please help her so her reasonable request
won't be denied.

75
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:05,657
You want me to help her?

76
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,910
If this gets approved,
it'll set a precedent

77
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,454
for law professors practicing law
as public defenders.

78
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:13,040
Students can assist them
and learn what it's like

79
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,375
to work as a criminal defense attorney,
firsthand.

80
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,129
You always emphasized the importance
of giving students

81
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:22,257
firsthand experience.
This will make it happen.

82
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,051
I can tell that there's something.

83
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,388
If it's copied, hand it over.

84
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,806
What happened? Tell me.

85
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,559
Knowing you, you'd never ask anyone
for such a favor.

86
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,356
But I could express my opinion.

87
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:44,530
You're requesting a jury trial?

88
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:45,531
Yes.

89
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:48,200
I do not understand why that is necessary.

90
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,868
The defendant has pleaded guilty.

91
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,205
No, she only admitted
to causing the victim's injury.

92
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:58,710
I'll prove that she acted in self-defense
and, therefore, is not guilty.

93
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,213
A jury trial?

94
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,799
Self-defense?

95
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:05,467
Jeez.

96
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,220
Yang Jong-hoon, that prick…

97
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,515
A jury trial could work
in Yeong-chang's favor.

98
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,685
If Yang is found guilty,
the Court will be criticized

99
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,895
for appointing a murderer
as a public defender.

100
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,772
And the jury won't rule in their favor.

101
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:20,107
Self-defense?

102
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,234
Not a chance.

103
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:26,113
So it's up to you.

104
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:30,534
And? Another pain in the butt?

105
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,537
It's not a big deal.

106
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,832
Small problems can be a real nuisance.

107
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,459
This guy is Yang's student?

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,341
Remember the TOYGOODTOY CEO
who burned himself to death? It's his son.

109
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,303
He burned himself to death?

110
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,639
TOYGOODTOY? That toy company?

111
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,809
I'll take care of it, sir.

112
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:59,229
When I saw Prof. Yang enter the courtroom,

113
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:01,648
I couldn't believe my eyes. It was unreal.

114
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,151
I am glad that he's representing her, but…

115
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:07,612
Isn't it a bit much though?
I mean, he's losing his own trial.

116
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:09,573
He should worry about his own trial.

117
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,992
Prof. Kim is at the restaurant.

118
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,410
Count me out.

119
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:16,079
I have an upset stomach,
and I have to go home.

120
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:17,164
I'll call you later.

121
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:22,377
She would never say no to free food.

122
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,837
Did she actually fail?

123
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,213
Her stomach is upset.

124
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,883
She is upset, not her stomach.

125
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,801
She's upset because she failed.

126
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:31,637
Why else? This is so unlike her.

127
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,601
Oh, that's my sister. See you. Bye!

128
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:39,102
Okay, bye!

129
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,938
My cutie-pie!

130
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,068
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

131
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,196
Ice cream on this cold day?

132
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,660
Gosh.

133
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,872
-Are you stressed out?
-Yeah.

134
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:02,417
Why am I studying law
when I'm not smart enough?

135
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,545
-Are you that stressed out?
-Yeah.

136
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:08,757
I'm not smart like Dan, you know.

137
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,219
She must've struggled too.

138
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,806
Yeah.

139
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:17,766
She did.

140
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,355
You didn't live with us,
so you probably don't know.

141
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,733
Dad started gambling on top of everything,

142
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,652
so Mom had a really hard time.

143
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:30,862
Dan got very upset

144
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:34,783
every time she saw Dad give Mom
a hard time.

145
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,414
He took all the money you sent

146
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,082
and went gambling.

147
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,460
Why didn't you tell me back then?

148
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:49,131
Mom told me not to tell you.

149
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:53,635
She was afraid you'd do something to Dad
if you found out.

150
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,014
I still wanted to tell you,

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,475
but Dan also told me not to.

152
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,187
I see.

153
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,148
I had no idea.

154
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,276
Will you keep studying?

155
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,111
You won't give up, right?

156
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,115
Oh, did you find out your grades?

157
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,244
Hey, did you find out your grades?

158
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:20,412
What?

159
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,583
Sauce or no sauce?
You can eat whichever one you prefer.

160
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,461
We should talk about the jury trial
before the food comes out.

161
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:30,714
Is a jury trial really a good idea though?

162
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:33,467
Aren't Ko Yeong-chang's arm
and leg paralyzed?

163
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,427
Wouldn't the jury feel bad for him?

164
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,430
It would still be better
than just leaving it up to the Court.

165
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:42,184
An accident left the chief judge's son
paralyzed from the waist down.

166
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:43,143
Really?

167
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,313
That won't do Ye-seul any good.

168
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:48,732
-Judges are humans too.
-Totally.

169
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,025
But how do you know?

170
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,320
Right, there are many judges
in her family. Gosh.

171
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,781
I wish I was born into a family like that.

172
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:57,449
Your family's rich.

173
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:59,451
Nouveau riche.

174
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,411
Not like this prestigious family.

175
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:02,829
Did you hear anything else?

176
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:05,874
Not a single case has been ruled
self-defense in that court.

177
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,501
-Zero?
-Zero?

178
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:09,836
Then this will be the first.

179
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:13,340
In my next life, I want to be born as you.

180
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:17,177
Ye-seul has to tell them what he did
to prove it was self-defense,

181
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,804
so she should press charges too.

182
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,314
I don't want to press charges.

183
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:30,524
Why not?

184
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,902
Ye-seul, I understand how you feel.

185
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,238
I don't, so tell me.

186
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,199
He may have to live with a disability
for the rest of my life.

187
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,576
Right, I understand, but--

188
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,621
You'll ruin the trial
just because you feel guilty?

189
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,500
You'll ruin my first case
as a public defender?

190
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,960
Change your mind.

191
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,964
Prof. Yang, wait…

192
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,675
Just a second. Prof. Yang.

193
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,062
Just do what your heart says.

194
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:12,232
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:15,318
-For putting you through this.
-I know.

196
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,612
I don't want to miss out on <i>tangsuyuk</i>.

197
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,948
Let's go have some <i>tangsuyuk.</i>

198
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:40,468
WILL NOT FAIL

199
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,639
Everyone's busy trying to help Ye-seul.

200
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:45,890
PRINT/COPIES

201
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:46,975
Oh, right.

202
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:51,896
Here.

203
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,152
I practically lived on this
while preparing for the judicial exam.

204
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:00,280
There were days
when I ate nothing but this.

205
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:01,823
Try it.

206
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,954
Do you know why I took
the judicial exam ten times?

207
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:10,081
Take a seat.

208
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:11,333
PRINT/COPIES

209
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:15,587
Where should I begin?

210
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:17,255
Right.

211
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:22,427
The second time I took it, I was so close.

212
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,847
And I felt that I'd pass it
if I studied just a little harder.

213
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,185
When I realized that wasn't the case,

214
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,230
I had already invested so much time in it.

215
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:38,026
"I can do this.
I've just had some bad luck."

216
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,239
I couldn't give up
even after wasting my youth.

217
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,158
Right.

218
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,286
It was like a drug.
Do you know how I gave up?

219
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:52,999
I didn't know what else I could do,

220
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,959
so I kept hanging on. Then I had a dream.

221
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,171
In the dream,

222
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,966
I stole the exam paper and answer sheet
and ran away.

223
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,511
But I didn't even feel guilty.

224
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,013
I was fixated on passing the exam.

225
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,392
I couldn't run no matter how hard I tried,

226
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,936
so I went berserk and started bawling
like a crazy man.

227
00:12:13,978 --> 00:12:15,772
I know it was just a dream,

228
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:18,191
but I was ready

229
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,695
to sell my soul to the devil
if I could just pass the exam.

230
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,910
Oh, right.
Ms. Oh will pick up the copies soon.

231
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:32,205
Wait here.
I'll tell you the rest when I'm back.

232
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:33,456
Wait, okay?

233
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,569
MILL

234
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,659
This isn't good.

235
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:13,121
I put that up there
so you wouldn't do this.

236
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:15,623
Let's go. I'm here to see you anyway.

237
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,879
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSES LEE MAN-HO ACT

238
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:22,172
LEE MAN-HO SET TO BE FREED

239
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,301
PERFECT MURDER THAT LEFT NO EVIDENCE

240
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:29,929
THE SOLES WERE CUT OFF

241
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:41,858
So what's up?

242
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:45,945
My uncle never used to check
his blood sugar often,

243
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,741
but he checked it every day
just before he passed away.

244
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:58,124
You should've cared about him
when he was alive.

245
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:03,546
Your uncle's diabetes
had gotten a lot worse.

246
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,925
His blood sugar was totally out of whack,

247
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:10,678
so his doctor told him to check it daily
for two months

248
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,597
and that he'd be hospitalized otherwise.

249
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:15,975
Then he started checking it regularly.

250
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:22,023
Did his doctor give him
a blood glucose logbook?

251
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:23,608
A logbook?

252
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:45,588
2:08 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

253
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,090
BLOOD GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

254
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:51,719
BLOOD GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

255
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,045
What is this?

256
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:27,964
KANG SOL

257
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:34,804
She refuses to write "Kang Sol B" on this?

258
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:37,140
Okay, fine.

259
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:44,355
KANG SOL A+

260
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:48,193
Hey, roomie. Why do you want
to drink this anyway?

261
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,075
Why are you drinking water
as if it's booze?

262
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,286
And what was that sound?

263
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:00,455
Gosh.

264
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:02,624
What is this?

265
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,709
It's booze.

266
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:07,754
Because of your grades?

267
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,007
Oh, my grades?

268
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:13,760
My darn grades.

269
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,850
To make up for the warning
in the first semester,

270
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:25,230
I studied so hard in the second semester.

271
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:27,649
I'm telling you, I studied really,

272
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,693
really hard.

273
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:32,570
You know that.

274
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,616
"You can do it"? Whatever.

275
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:39,744
That's like giving false hope.

276
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,249
Gosh.

277
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,752
Guess what my 1L GPA is.

278
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:52,215
Hey, what?

279
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:55,176
Are you worried that I might've failed?

280
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:58,054
Come on. Why would I be worried?

281
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:00,848
You're mean.

282
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:04,185
I was worried sick when I was checking it.

283
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:08,064
Just tell me.

284
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:14,821
It's 2.02.

285
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:20,034
Are you relieved to hear

286
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,370
that it's over 2.0
and I don't have to retake 1L?

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,626
I was so excited.

288
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,920
I was totally stoked.

289
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:34,507
But, you know,

290
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:40,555
seeing myself like that
made me feel so pathetic.

291
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:44,225
I'm at the bottom anyway.

292
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,021
Like a loser, I got all excited about

293
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:52,483
going up a tad bit from the rugged bottom.

294
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:58,948
Gosh.

295
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,328
You guys at the top must think

296
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,205
I'm like the most ridiculous joke ever.

297
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,501
I went through all that trouble
to get into this school

298
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:14,005
just so I could make
you smarty-pants shine.

299
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:18,593
Look at you.

300
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:21,220
You're trying hard not to laugh at me.

301
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,099
You're drunk. Let's go.

302
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,601
That's what you're doing.

303
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:33,566
Dan is the one who belongs here, not me.

304
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:43,201
I should've kneeled before the dirty money
instead of her.

305
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:49,415
I'm off.

306
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:52,251
Hey.

307
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:55,922
-Make sure you catch…
-Gosh.

308
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:57,507
What?

309
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,841
Not me!

310
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,635
The real killer.

311
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,911
Oh, Kang Sol A plus.

312
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:30,289
It makes no sense
that you're Kang Sol "B".

313
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,334
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,047
I'm sorry that I have the same name
as yours.

315
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:41,217
Get up.

316
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:46,431
Yes, I should.

317
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:52,562
To help Ye-seul prove that
it was self-defense and be acquitted,

318
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:54,105
I must study the precedents.

319
00:19:56,732 --> 00:20:00,319
"The defendant… It is unfair…"

320
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,447
"It is unfair…"

00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:29,098
Yes, it was moved to September 26th.

327
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,559
-Why do you ask?
-What?

328
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,519
Oh, nothing.

329
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,192
Did you contact him?

330
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,134
Why am I here?

331
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,680
I'm so hungover.

332
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:15,603
<i>Come out if you're hungover.</i>

333
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,001
PRE-HEARING FOR KANG SOL B'S
PLAGIARISM CASE

334
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:42,797
So, you wrote this with Prof. Seo
when you were in middle school.

335
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,675
Then you submitted it to the contest,
not knowing that he had

336
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,510
submitted it to Harvard?

337
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,470
Had I known about it,

338
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:51,639
I would not have submitted it
to the contest.

339
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:55,017
It says we co-wrote it,
but I actually wrote most of it.

340
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:59,063
You were interested in this topic
when you were in middle school?

341
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:01,732
I was interested in infringement
of fundamental rights.

342
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:05,069
This law, where our right to know
clashes with defendants' rights,

343
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:07,613
only exists in Korea,
so I wanted to dig deeper.

344
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,700
So, you submitted what you wrote

345
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:13,577
back in middle school to the contest
after entering college.

346
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:15,538
I wanted to submit it back then,

347
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:17,623
but only college students were eligible.

348
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:20,418
Obviously, many years have passed
since then.

349
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,462
And you submitted it
without checking the new cases

350
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:26,007
and theories that have been introduced
since then?

351
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,135
No one was indicted for it
during those years, so there was

352
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,553
no criminal case to refer to.

353
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,847
And no theoretical controversies either.

354
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,183
But there was a notable civil case.

355
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:39,145
It examines whether the law
only exists in Korea

356
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:42,189
and if there are similar criminal cases
in other countries,

357
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,816
so I didn't include civil cases.

358
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,403
Since I never wrote about them,
I didn't need to update it.

359
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:48,946
KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARISM

360
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,490
I was confident
that it was a well-written piece.

361
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:54,243
You sure come from a family
of law professionals.

362
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:57,788
Prof. Yang,
would you like to say anything?

363
00:22:58,914 --> 00:23:00,249
Anything else?

364
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,254
My middle school friend
also goes to Hankuk Law.

365
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:08,758
If you still don't believe me,
you can ask him.

366
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:11,093
-You mean, Seo Ji-ho?
-Yes.

367
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:13,846
He can verify that I actually wrote it
in middle school.

368
00:23:21,604 --> 00:23:24,690
I feel like I just got punched
in the face, big-time.

369
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:29,070
She refuted all the reasons
why I was suspecting her,

370
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:31,489
and I had nothing to say.
How embarrassing is that?

371
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:35,368
I'm beginning to think that
maybe I was wrong.

372
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:38,579
Let's just ask the vice dean.

373
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:41,165
He must know the truth
since he's her father.

374
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:42,458
Oh, right.

375
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,711
He said he'd cooperate and stay out of it.
He won't do more than that.

376
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:50,132
You know, about Sol B…
She even mentioned Ji-ho.

377
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,635
They must've cut a deal of some sort.

378
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:54,261
-Right.
-What about Seung-jae?

379
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:57,807
I haven't heard from him since then.

380
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,351
His wife went through a lot to conceive,

381
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:02,311
so I'll wait until the end of the week.

382
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,106
Before your next trial, I'll--

383
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:06,273
Can I borrow your car?

384
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:12,822
Hey, where's mine?

385
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:16,033
You didn't get one for me? You're so mean.

386
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:17,451
Like I knew when you'd come.

387
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,586
It's hot.

388
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:31,215
This had better get rid of my hangover.

389
00:24:34,218 --> 00:24:37,596
Hey, I can't find any cases
that are similar to Ye-seul's

390
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,724
-for the life of me.
-I told you there's none.

391
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:43,894
-Well, in case you missed something.
-Me?

392
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:44,812
Jeez.

393
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:48,983
BLOOD GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

394
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,235
What's this?

395
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:52,820
The ones that are circled.

396
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:54,864
Look. 227, what the prosecutor mentioned.

BLOOD GLUCOSE TRACKER

399
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,370
What is this?

400
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:03,622
-Then…
-You know me.

401
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:07,418
Of course. You rock!

402
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:08,711
What a relief.

403
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,754
-My gosh.
-Give it back.

404
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:11,922
Where are you going?

405
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:13,591
To see the one who'd be thrilled.

406
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:19,388
Right, you do deserve all the spotlight.

407
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:22,600
Thank God I didn't fail.

408
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:27,480
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

409
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,318
You can drive, right?

LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

411
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,492
What? You want me to file an appeal?

412
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,827
I've given up,
so they'll reduce your sentence.

413
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,705
I'll file a petition asking for leniency.

414
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:46,957
I'd really appreciate that, but…

415
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,920
I told you you're wasting your time.

416
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,512
I said I did it alone because of a grudge!

417
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,347
No one put me up to it!

418
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:09,855
SHOE PRINT, MURDER

419
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,524
BLOOD SMELLS DELICIOUS

420
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,692
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

421
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:15,486
PERFECT MURDER THAT LEFT NO EVIDENCE

422
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:19,365
SOLES WERE CUT OFF TO PREVENT SHOE PRINTS

423
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:24,828
What a waste of time.
Someone beat me to it and met him already.

424
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,374
I don't know who it is.

425
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,377
SEOUL BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

426
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:36,757
Oh, I know who it is. It's Yang Jong-hoon.

427
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:44,765
431R 5326

428
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:45,849
Something's fishy.

429
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:47,977
Doesn't the plate look fake?

430
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:50,104
431R 5326

431
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:52,731
The person who ordered him to kill you

432
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:55,526
at the detention center
must be the culprit.

433
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,195
431R 5326

434
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:03,617

435
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,787
431R 5326

436
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,259
Are you all right?

437
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:22,886
I don't want to die
before I clear my name.

438
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:25,431
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,100
We must catch the killer.

GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

441
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:33,480
BLOOD GLUCOSE TRACKER

442
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:37,067
One of my uncle's belongings is missing.

443
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:38,527
His pen?

444
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:44,617
Oh, isn't that pizza?

445
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:45,993
Who bought this?

446
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,494
YU SEUNG-JAE

447
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,330
Oh, Seung-jae ordered it for us.

448
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,081
Where is he? Why only send this?

449
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:52,082
He was here.

450
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,959
Seung-jae was here.

451
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:55,294
When?

452
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:57,630
He should've waited a bit to say hi.

453
00:27:57,713 --> 00:27:59,715
He's in shock because his grades dropped.

454
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:02,426
I get it though.
He always got an A plus on everything.

455
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,845
Maybe that A plus was the problem.

456
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:07,348
"The problem"?

457
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:09,183
Do you know something?

458
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,769
Say nothing.
Let's not talk behind his back.

459
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:13,354
I'm just curious. That's all.

460
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:15,272
Then ask him directly.

461
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:17,691
She's right.
He bought us this pizza after all.

462
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,777
What did I even do?

463
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,447
Like Seung-jae wrote here,
let's help Ye-seul return to school.

464
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:46,220
Do you know

465
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:49,098
why I asked you to come here?

466
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:55,688
Come closer.

467
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:08,742
Self-defense?

468
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:10,119
I'm sorry.

469
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:11,745
Then beg for my forgiveness.

470
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:13,414
Beg until your limbs feel numb.

471
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:16,125
You did this to me.
And what? Self-defense?

472
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:17,918
Why?

473
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,796
Because that bastard suggested it?

474
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:23,424
Ko Yeong-chang, the victim,
recorded spy cam sex videos--

475
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,010
Hey, let's just call them
"spy cam videos."

476
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:27,678
He says the camera wasn't hidden,

477
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,097
and he was going to delete them,
not spread them.

478
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,224
Bullshit! He wrote a novel.

479
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:34,727
I wrote a novel too.

480
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,854
I'd call it a blatant lie, not a novel.

481
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:38,272
Sum up their arguments.

482
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,231
Me?

483
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:41,734
Right, I should.

484
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:45,154
The two of them were in a relationship
for over three years.

485
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:48,407
They prepared for law school together,
but only Ye-seul got in.

486
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,075
Those are facts.

487
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,076
Ko insists that

488
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,996
Ye-seul two-timed him
after getting into law school.

489
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,330
Apparently, with me.

490
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:59,418
They insist that Ye-seul
witnessed my uncle's murder.

491
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:01,837
Prof. Yang's threats stressed her out,

492
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,006
so Ko persuaded her to testify
against him.

493
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,966
Gosh, that's just ridiculous.

494
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,135
So, she decided to do it,

495
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:11,680
but I blackmailed her into walking back
her statements to help Prof. Yang.

496
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:13,640
You "blackmailed" her? How?

497
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:17,061
I heard that jerk, Han Joon-hwi,
threatened you that he'd tell others

498
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:18,937
about me stopping by every night.

499
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,443
So, you betrayed me and walked back
your statements, which means

500
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,570
you were ready to break up with me.

501
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,033
I was going to delete our videos.
Why did you try to stop me?

502
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:37,664
I will…

503
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,210
pray for your recovery.

504
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,510
You can pray in jail!

505
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:52,638
This is bullshit.
I can't believe they're buying this.

506
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:55,390
I hope Seung-jae buys my story.

507
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:58,310
Why would such successful lawyers
want to waste their talent--

508
00:30:58,393 --> 00:30:59,812
This is well-crafted bullshit.

509
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:01,605
Should I have added more details?

510
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:06,235
I heard Ko got rid of his phone, laptop,
and even his dash cam,

511
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:08,737
and he's saying he never installed
the spy camera.

512
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:11,698
-Was the camera hidden or not?
-Did he intend to disseminate it?

513
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:13,909
We must emphasize
that he was abusive to her.

514
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:14,827
No!

515
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,789
Oh, not that.

516
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:22,584
If the media covers this,
it'll become fake news.

517
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:29,967
Fake news?

518
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:39,017
AUDIO TRANSCRIPT CALL RECORDING

519
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:43,355
I did this around the time when I had
to wear sunglasses to your lecture.

520
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,567
I thought something had to be done.

521
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,527
There's a medical certificate.

522
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,030
And I recorded him saying
that he'd never do it again.

523
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,950
This proves that he was abusive to you.

524
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:56,952
So you want to press charges?

525
00:31:57,035 --> 00:32:00,414
I'd like you to only use them
to prove my innocence.

526
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,627
I know he hurt me,

527
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:09,214
but he's paying for it already.

528
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:14,386
Let's get the facts straight.

529
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:17,931
He's not paying for what he did to you.

530
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:20,225
While committing the crime,
an accident happened.

531
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,810
It's his own fault, not yours.

532
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:28,942
-Sol.
-Hey.

533
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:32,988
Assemblyman Ko used fake news
to make his opponent take his own life…

534
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,618
Can you give us a moment?

535
00:32:39,161 --> 00:32:42,748
We must win the trial to make sure Ye-seul
won't fall victim to fake news.

536
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,459
Assemblyman Ko has done this before.

537
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:47,961
This time, he's colluding

538
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,923
with all the hotshot lawyers
to help his son.

539
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,675
The sad thing is that it works.

540
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,427
Why do you think Dan left?

541
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:57,429
She became a whistleblower

542
00:32:57,512 --> 00:32:59,723
so he could be punished
for his corruption.

543
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,684
But she gave in
and accepted the dirty money.

544
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,689
Have you heard from her since then?

545
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:09,733
She will contact me
if that is why she left.

546
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,071
Prof. Yang,

547
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:17,282
I want to prove that Ye-seul acted
in self-defense

548
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:19,534
so I can teach Assemblyman Ko a lesson.

549
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:22,204
I really want to show him
that he can no longer

550
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:25,332
use fake news and weasel out of things.

551
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,756
Oh, this is…

552
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,800
Dating violence could become a key issue.

553
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:36,426
Study jury trials first.

554
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:39,596
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

555
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,893
There is a small myoma.

556
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:48,605
But considering the location and the size,
I think we can just monitor it.

557
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:51,984
The cervical cancer biopsy results
will be out within a week.

558
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,152
Your baby's doing well?

559
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,280
Yes, thanks to you.

560
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:59,908
I feel bad because I can't breastfeed
my baby as often as I want to.

561
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:01,994
I heard you're pregnant.

562
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:03,954
Congratulations.

563
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:07,249
I told him not to tell anyone
until it's considered safe.

564
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:10,002
I guess Seung-jae told you.

565
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:12,963
I'm not surprised. He's very fond of you.

566
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:19,261
I want to respect his decision

567
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:22,681
to study law for our baby's sake.

568
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:28,145
-Please take good care of him.
-Gosh, of course.

569
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:30,981
He always does a good job, doesn't he?

570
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:34,568
Right, what's going on with Ye-seul?

571
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:38,030
If Assemblyman Ko is involved,
it won't be easy.

572
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,742
They won't have it easy either
now that Prof. Yang is her attorney.

573
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:45,245
Well, what about his own trial though?

574
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:49,041
Seung-jae seems very worried about it.

575
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,255
Yes! Cho Ye-bum.

576
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:59,092
Nice, the Prosecution Service.
I'm excited.

577
00:34:59,593 --> 00:35:02,304
Oh, Hyeongseol?
You want to get this confirmed?

578
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,514
Bok-gi, you're…

579
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:07,934
Well, I want to be a human rights lawyer,

580
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,103
so I don't like those big law firms.

581
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:11,229
Will they want you?

582
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:12,356
What?

583
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:15,650
Hey, isn't that the law firm
Ko Yeong-chang hired?

584
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:18,528
-If you go there--
-I won't be able to help Ye-seul.

585
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,323
-Hey, how could you--
-Hold on. What is this?

586
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:22,532
Your name isn't here.

587
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,159
Is this an error?

588
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,037
You didn't get it?

589
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,080
Go ask them.

590
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:38,673
She aced the final exam even after
switching to Prof. Moon's class.

591
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:41,426
The vice dean gave her a lower grade.

592
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,720
Rumor has it that
he deliberately penalized her

593
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:45,972
after people found out
she was his daughter.

594
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:49,142
Oh, Prof. Yang has posted a notice.

595
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:50,310
What?

596
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:52,646
<i>All Hankuk Law students are invited</i>

597
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:56,108
<i>to attend the final hearing</i>
<i>of Prof. Seo Byung-ju's case</i>

598
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,943
<i>which will take place today at 2 p.m.</i>

599
00:35:58,026 --> 00:36:00,529
What does he want to show us?
He's clearly losing.

600
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:02,614
Clearly, he has something to show us.

601
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:04,074
Do you know anything?

602
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:05,784
We shall find out.

603
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:10,539
Ye-seul has to testify again today.

604
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:11,998
I wonder if she'll be okay.

605
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,292
Why don't you call her
instead of just worrying?

606
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:16,211
-Every crisis is an opportunity.
-Stop!

607
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:17,504
Seriously, don't!

608
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,732
Seung-jae.

609
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:40,193
Headed to the Court, right?

610
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:47,367
What is this?

611
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:50,036
I don't have the courage
to be on the witness stand.

612
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,789
<i>Make sure Prof. Yang gets it.</i>

613
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:22,473
I'm here.

614
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,851
I told you this is faster
when the traffic's bad.

615
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,978
Where's Seung-jae?

616
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:15,151
Professor!

617
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,947
We're sorry for making you testify twice.

618
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,116
-No matter what the prosecutor--
-What do I do?

619
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,077
The flash drive…

620
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:37,090
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S FINAL TRIAL

621
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:40,385
As you can see, all the numbers match.

622
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:43,304
However, this date on the logbook

623
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,473
is different from the one
on the glucometer.

624
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,183
Right, by one day.

625
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:48,976
Which date is the correct one?

626
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,311
OCTOBER 5, OCTOBER 4, 2020

627
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:53,606
The handwritten entry in the logbook,
of course.

628
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:57,151
The date could've been entered wrong
on the glucometer.

629
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:00,905
According to this logbook,
the blood glucose level of 227,

630
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:04,909
which the prosecutor mentioned,
was recorded the day before the incident.

631
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,205
We must verify that the logbook
and the handwriting

632
00:39:09,288 --> 00:39:10,623
-are indeed--
-You doubt it.

633
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,684
Then let's check one more thing.

634
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,085
SEPTEMBER 26

635
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,587
That information is saved
on the glucometer.

636
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:21,968
Take notice that it says it was recorded
on September 26th at 11:30 a.m.

637
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:26,264
The mock trial class for September 25th
was canceled

638
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:30,435
and was moved to Saturday the 26th
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., right?

639
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:35,565
In the audience,
we have students who attended

640
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:38,651
the victim's mock trial class
on September 26th at 11:30 a.m.

641
00:39:38,735 --> 00:39:42,447
It went on for three hours as the class
the day before had been canceled.

642
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,617
Hence, the victim was not able to check
his blood sugar during that time,

643
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,537
which means this was actually measured

644
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,166
at 11:30 a.m. on the 25th,
the day before the class.

645
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:57,044
It doesn't rule out the possibility
that the logbook was manipulated.

646
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,007
11:30 A.M. SEPTEMBER 26

647
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:03,134
Well,

648
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:08,598
to prove that everything in this logbook
was recorded by the victim himself,

649
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,266
we'd like to bring in a witness.

650
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,851
Who is the witness?

651
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:16,606
The victim's personal driver
who happens to be in this courtroom now.

652
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:19,317
We'd like to bring in Mr. Lee Man-ho
as a witness.

653
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:22,653
Objection.
Mr. Lee Man-ho already testified.

654
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:24,781
So did Ms. Jeon Ye-seul,

655
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:27,116
but the Court has approved your request.

656
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,993
-This is different!
-How so?

657
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:32,580
Mr. Lee Man-ho is a sex offender.
He is not a credible witness…

658
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,543
Are you arguing that
he is far less credible than Ms. Jeon?

659
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,549
I ask that we take a recess.

660
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:46,677
Joon-hwi never lets us down.

661
00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:51,224
Thanks to him,
high blood sugar has been ruled out.

662
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:53,017
Let's see.

663
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,852
The missing laptop, out.

664
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:57,355
The one-way flight ticket, out.
High blood sugar, out.

665
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,733
And his request to bring in Lee Man-ho
as a witness. What timing!

666
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:04,612
If the prosecutor questions
Lee's credibility as a witness,

667
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,573
it means everything he said
when testifying against Prof. Yang

668
00:41:07,657 --> 00:41:09,242
can't be trusted either.

669
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:12,662
While making Ye-seul seem more credible.

670
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:15,289
So, the prosecutor realized
he was digging his own grave.

671
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,207
It's not enough.

672
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,709
They must prove that it was sugar,
not meth,

673
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:21,629
in order to invalidate
Prof. Yang's fingerprints and DNA.

674
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,840
Why aren't they asking you to testify?

675
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:25,925
You really didn't see it?

676
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,262
I saw it.

677
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,436
You've never seen the logbook

678
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,480
and Seo Byung-ju didn't write that, okay?

679
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,482
I would never commit perjury.

680
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,404
FLOOR DIRECTORY

681
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:49,907
If I get caught, I'll go to jail.

682
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:55,371
Ending up in jail again
is what I fear the most.

683
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:02,962
FLOOR DIRECTORY

684
00:42:03,045 --> 00:42:06,340
You seem to have serious trust issues.

685
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:12,388
Why did I help you out
when you put me behind bars?

686
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,225
To help you out,
I even said that I was the one

687
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:18,936
who leaked the info about Yang's charges.

688
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,522
You benefited from my testimony.

689
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,775
How dare you question my credibility
as a witness?

690
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:26,736
Get lost, will you?

691
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:30,197
Don't you dare tell me what to do!

692
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,993
I don't report to you, do I?

693
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:48,883
AUNT

694
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:57,433
Since Mr. Lee Man-ho isn't here
at the moment,

695
00:42:57,516 --> 00:43:01,854
I must dismiss the counsel's request
to bring him in as a witness.

696
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,315
ACCUSED

697
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:05,274
Prosecution.

698
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:07,485
Give your closing statement.

699
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,909
Recently, Mr. Yang told me

700
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:17,745
that he became a law professor

701
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:21,165
to make sure there are
no more prosecutors like me.

702
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,209
When I heard that,

703
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:27,546
I became even more convinced
that he is the killer.

704
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,716
In a world without prosecutors like me,

705
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,594
the likes of Mr. Yang,
who take advantage of the laws

706
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,847
can get away with anything, even a murder.

707
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:42,395
Gosh.

708
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:43,562
Pick up.

709
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:53,030
PROFESSOR KIM EUN-SUK

710
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:54,490
<i>If what Mr. Yang</i>

711
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:57,994
put in the victim's coffee
was indeed sugar, not a drug,

712
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:01,414
and if the real killer
took the empty sugar packet

713
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:03,416
to frame Mr. Yang for the murder,

714
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:07,169
then the killer should know that Mr. Yang

715
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:11,215
had fed the coffee with sugar
to the victim

716
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:15,261
because the killer must've seen him do it.

717
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:18,723
The cup and the sugar packet
had Mr. Yang's prints all over them,

718
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:23,519
so the killer left them there as evidence
and drugged the victim.

719
00:44:23,602 --> 00:44:24,603
MISCELLANEOUS

720
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:27,398
But among those whose shoe prints
were found at the scene...

721
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,566
PROSECUTION

722
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,609
everyone, except for Ms. Jeon Ye-seul,

723
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:37,324
has an alibi proving that
they weren't able to witness

724
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,705
Mr. Yang feeding coffee to the victim
between 14:05 and 14:15.

725
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:49,545
And with Ms. Jeon too, we could not find
any evidence related to methamphetamine.

726
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:52,256
-Mr. Yang may have told--
-No, I did not.

727
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,684
Defendant, Yang Jong-hoon, lost his temper

728
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,645
upon finding out that the victim,
Prof. Seo Byung-ju,

729
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:09,607
was the real culprit
behind his only cold case.

730
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:13,736
On a spur of the moment, he drugged
the victim's coffee, which killed him.

731
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:16,822
He killed a precious life
because of his personal grudge,

732
00:45:16,906 --> 00:45:19,408
and it cannot be forgiven.

733
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:24,038
Moreover, Mr. Yang is a law professor
who teaches criminal law,

734
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,874
so what he did should rightfully
be condemned.

735
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,962
Ergo, I request that he be sentenced

736
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:35,007
to 20 years in prison.

737
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:59,281
Defendant, please give
your closing argument.

738
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:00,991
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

739
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,936
Defendant, please give
your closing argument.

740
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,646
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

741
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,995
"Make sure no one ever suffers unjustly

742
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:35,165
even if you end up losing 99 perps."

743
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:40,504
<i>The late prosecutor Mr. Seo Byung-ju</i>
<i>hated this saying the most.</i>

744
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:43,381
"What about all the innocent people
who end up

745
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:45,759
suffering unfairly
because of the 99 perps?"

746
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:48,512
He said it is a prosecutor's duty
to make sure no one,

747
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:50,889
not even one person,
ever suffers unjustly.

748
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:53,350
<i>However, he caused</i>

749
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:56,645
<i>a hit-and-run that killed</i>
<i>an innocent victim.</i>

750
00:46:57,854 --> 00:47:00,982
<i>Then his life and career as a prosecutor</i>
<i>started to fall apart,</i>

751
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,568
<i>and he passed away.</i>

752
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:08,907
One thing I'm sure of
is that Mr. Seo would not want

753
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:12,661
anyone else to suffer unjustly
because of his death.

754
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:16,831
The investigation began

755
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:20,460
with me pegged as the killer.

756
00:47:21,503 --> 00:47:23,547
They only looked at evidence that put me

757
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,590
at a disadvantage and ignored the rest.

758
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:30,136
They completely dismissed the possibility
of it being a premeditated murder.

759
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:34,599
They shouldn't have focused
on the shoe prints to begin with.

760
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,560
If the goal was a perfect murder,

761
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:39,020
the killer mustn't have left
any shoe prints

762
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:40,772
to avoid becoming a suspect.

763
00:47:40,855 --> 00:47:44,734
Would anyone be foolish enough to leave
shoe prints if it was premeditated?

764
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:52,701
Oh, I'm doing this because I do not wish
to leave a trail as a defendant.

765
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:56,788
I never imagined
I'd be tried as a defendant.

766
00:47:56,871 --> 00:48:00,667
I always thought I'd be sitting here,
until I joined the law school.

767
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,378
Defendant, please be seated.

768
00:48:09,175 --> 00:48:12,929
You made me a defendant. And for that,
I loathe you more than Mr. Seo.

769
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:14,472
PROSECUTION

770
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:17,142
But killing someone out of anger
and leaving my prints…

771
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:22,647
I'm not that foolish.

772
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:29,904
You think the killer had to have seen me
adding sugar at the scene

773
00:48:29,988 --> 00:48:31,781
to take the empty sugar packet?

774
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:35,285
The killer could've witnessed it
without being at the scene.

775
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:39,039
What if there was a camera hidden
somewhere like the one in Ye-seul's room?

776
00:48:39,122 --> 00:48:42,042
The killer was watching my uncle
elsewhere,

777
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:43,710
waiting for the perfect time.

778
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:47,922
Then when the job was done, the killer
took the sugar packet and the camera.

779
00:48:48,006 --> 00:48:51,176
He had this pen during the mock trial,
but it's gone.

780
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:53,303
It wasn't there
when he was first found dead.

781
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:56,640
The victim's pen was nowhere to be found
on the day of the incident,

782
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,600
but the police wasn't interested.

783
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,105
And he dismissed the possibility
of methamphetamine being injected.

784
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:08,610
This needle mark here looks different
from these insulin injection marks.

785
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:09,653
You're right.

786
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:13,073
It looks like a thicker needle was used.

787
00:49:13,156 --> 00:49:15,450
-What about the location?
-The upper abdomen.

788
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:18,662
The fat layer under the skin
around that area isn't that thick,

789
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:21,081
so it's not an ideal area
for insulin injections.

790
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:23,917
A deep injection into this spot here
would release the drug

791
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,335
directly into the stomach.

792
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:30,173
Then why did the police just assume
this was from an insulin injection?

793
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:35,136
Had the killer planned to drug
the victim's beverage,

794
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,681
it would've been done in secret.

795
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:38,932
Why is that?

796
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:41,810
Because the victim
would've resisted strongly otherwise.

797
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:44,396
<i>Had the killer forced the victim</i>
<i>to take a lethal dose,</i>

798
00:49:44,479 --> 00:49:46,690
<i>there would've been clear signs</i>
<i>of struggle.</i>

799
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:49,359
There were no signs of struggle
or any defensive wounds.

800
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:55,240
If the killer had installed a camera
and managed to leave no prints,

801
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:57,909
he or she would've opted for an injection
as it's faster.

802
00:49:57,992 --> 00:50:00,495
If you drug someone's beverage,
on the other hand,

803
00:50:00,578 --> 00:50:02,414
it'd depend on the person,

804
00:50:02,497 --> 00:50:05,166
but it could take up to 30 minutes.

805
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,045
But in case of an intravenous injection,
it only takes a few seconds.

806
00:50:09,129 --> 00:50:12,966
Even if it's not an IV injection,
it rarely takes more than ten minutes.

807
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:16,553
<i>If the killer injected the victim</i>
<i>with methamphetamine</i>

808
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:19,973
at around 14:25
after Kang Sol B and I left,

809
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:23,518
it closely matches
the estimated time of death as well.

810
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:29,190
Shoe prints.

811
00:50:29,816 --> 00:50:31,901
A hidden camera and an injection.

812
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,071
The prosecution should have
suspected these

813
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:38,241
and should not have ruled out
such possibilities.

814
00:50:38,324 --> 00:50:41,661
You must not only hear and see
what you want to believe.

815
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:44,414
You shouldn't be foolish enough
to let the killer

816
00:50:44,497 --> 00:50:47,792
roam free blinded by your false belief
that I'm the killer.

817
00:50:53,923 --> 00:50:56,509
WITNESS

818
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:58,470
Do you really think I am the killer?

819
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,849
Don't you have a reasonable doubt now?

820
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:06,060
In dubio pro reo.

821
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:09,105
WITNESS

822
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:10,273
Please remember that.

823
00:51:10,774 --> 00:51:12,901
JUDGE

824
00:51:12,984 --> 00:51:14,235
Are you done?

825
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:19,949
WITNESS

826
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:25,705
This smoking gun will prove my alibi.

827
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,750
<i>At the time of Prof. Seo's death,</i>

828
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,419
<i>Prof. Yang was in his office.</i>

829
00:51:32,712 --> 00:51:36,216
<i>He called Prof. Seo as soon as he arrived</i>

830
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,843
<i>and made sure he had recovered</i>

831
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:42,555
<i>from the hypoglycemic episode</i>
<i>after drinking the coffee with sugar.</i>

832
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,142
A student who had sneaked into my office
around the time of the incident

833
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:48,561
to hack my laptop
and ended up hiding in my closet,

834
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:52,398
recorded this statement
to help me prove my innocence.

835
00:51:55,735 --> 00:51:58,446
I tried to persuade him to testify,
but failed.

836
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:03,326
But today, he mustered up the courage
to deliver this to me through Ms. Jeon.

837
00:52:03,993 --> 00:52:05,119
PROSECUTION

838
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,288
Order!

839
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:08,665
010-523-6785

840
00:52:09,707 --> 00:52:11,709
-Ms. Jeon Ye-seul.
-Yes.

841
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:12,919
Is it true?

842
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,045
JUDGE

843
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:17,507
-Yes, he gave it to me before I came here.
-Objection.

844
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,051
No need. I don't plan to submit it anyway.

845
00:52:20,134 --> 00:52:21,469
-What?
-Why not?

846
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,889
Order!

847
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,645
Luckily, I was able to get my hands
on this smoking gun,

848
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:33,523
but this is considered inadmissible
at the moment.

849
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:34,566
Submit it.

850
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:37,402
Your Honor, I request
this piece of evidence be approved

851
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:39,153
and verified in this courtroom.

852
00:52:40,613 --> 00:52:41,531
Regardless of this,

853
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,410
the Court's decision is…

854
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:48,371
That's what I want to know.

855
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:51,791
Over the course of this trial,

856
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:56,212
I did my best to invalidate the evidence
submitted by the prosecutor,

857
00:52:56,296 --> 00:52:59,757
who launched the investigation
under the assumption that I am the killer.

858
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:05,805
The law scholar who testified
that there was sugar at the scene

859
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:08,975
is here today with an appeal letter
asking the Court not to question

860
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:10,643
the credibility of his testimony.

861
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:13,688
A student who lost his father
because of a prosecutor

862
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:15,565
who publicized mere allegations

863
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:18,651
is sitting over there, with faith
in the presumption of innocence.

864
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:22,030
Mr. Seo's frustrated nephew,
who's decided to take matters

865
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:25,408
into his own hands,
is also waiting to hear the decision.

866
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:27,410
The prosecutor

867
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:31,664
failed to prove that I am guilty
beyond all reasonable doubt.

868
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:33,833
Hence, I should be found not guilty.

869
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,925
As a professor who teaches criminal law…

870
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:43,092
JUDGE

871
00:53:44,677 --> 00:53:46,846
…I never tell my students
that the law is just.

872
00:53:48,097 --> 00:53:49,891
What makes the law just

873
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:53,436
are the judges' decisions based
on the presumption of innocence

874
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,398
and the law of evidence.
That is what I tell my students!

875
00:53:58,691 --> 00:54:00,109
I hope the Court

876
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:03,613
shows the future law professionals

877
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:08,242
what it means
to make a truly fair decision.

878
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:14,040
Please show them by example.

879
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:17,585
I rest my case.

880
00:54:18,169 --> 00:54:21,130
JUDGE

881
00:54:25,093 --> 00:54:27,261
If I am found guilty after this,

882
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:31,683
I will submit this to the appeals court.

883
00:54:36,729 --> 00:54:37,939
COURT

884
00:54:43,987 --> 00:54:46,030
My, I had no idea you'd use it like that.

885
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:47,907
I learned a lot from you.

886
00:54:48,491 --> 00:54:51,786
"In dubio pro reo." A defendant may not be
convicted when doubts remain?

887
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:55,915
I guess you're feeling confident.

888
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,208
Pulling this trick on me.

889
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,043
"Trick"?

890
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:05,174
Shall we go to the judge's office
and see what's here?

891
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:06,384
Sure.

892
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:10,221
We'll also show the judge the video
you watched during my closing argument.

893
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:15,393
So, you're deliberately barking up
the wrong tree.

894
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:18,563
Seo Ji-ho is the one barking up
the wrong tree.

895
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:21,190
If you don't want your student to be hurt,

896
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:23,943
persuade him to drop the case.

897
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,159
Jeez.

898
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:37,498
<i>Man, I have to say,</i>
<i>Yang Jong-hoon is really something.</i>

899
00:55:37,582 --> 00:55:39,834
His closing argument almost got me.

900
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:42,253
It is a tough battle for Jin Hyeong-u.

901
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:45,131
Oh, Yang has been appointed
as a special defense counsel for…

902
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:48,676
What now?

903
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,596
Go away. Go!

904
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:53,556
Let's talk in private.

905
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:04,484
-Where are you going?
-Later.

906
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,861
-Hey, Kim!
-Spare me a minute.

907
00:56:07,653 --> 00:56:08,821
I'm busy.

908
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:10,281
It's about your son.

909
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:16,621
POSTS

910
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:19,123
My dad made this toy.

911
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:23,419
You wrote that it contained
a cancer-causing chemical.

912
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,176
You had your bag stolen?

913
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,137
Then what was that flash drive earlier?

914
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,599
Gosh, he tricked us.

915
00:56:39,102 --> 00:56:41,145
How's Seung-jae?
Did he say anything unusual?

916
00:56:41,729 --> 00:56:44,732
He seemed down,
as if he was going somewhere far.

917
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:46,025
Somewhere far?

918
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:49,570
-He's not picking up.
-I know.

919
00:56:51,197 --> 00:56:53,408
Seung-jae? Is that you? Oh…

920
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:56,035
Isn't this Yu Seung-jae's phone?

921
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,413
What? By the river?

922
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:00,873
Where is it?

923
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:04,669
-What's the matter?
-I think Seung-jae--

924
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:06,879
Isn't Seung-jae the one
who hacked the laptop?

925
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:08,506
It's him, right? Tell us.

926
00:57:08,589 --> 00:57:09,924
-The smoking gun--
-Stop.

927
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:11,592
I told you to ask him directly.

928
00:57:11,676 --> 00:57:12,927
Hey, let's go.

929
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,139
Try to gauge the situation
before you run your mouth.

930
00:57:16,222 --> 00:57:17,181
Wait up!

931
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:19,434
Jeez, I can't even talk?

932
00:57:24,147 --> 00:57:25,273
<i>Come to the parking lot.</i>

933
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:28,985
Wait.

934
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:33,114
Can we talk?

935
00:57:33,197 --> 00:57:35,158
No, I have a prior engagement.

936
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:41,330
Call before the sentencing date.

937
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:47,003
Not after that.

938
00:57:51,674 --> 00:57:56,345
FISHERY

939
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:01,642
Yu Seung-jae!

940
00:58:03,102 --> 00:58:04,020
Prof. Kim.

941
00:58:08,274 --> 00:58:09,650
You punk.

942
00:58:09,734 --> 00:58:12,278
You could've turned your phone off
to avoid my calls.

943
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:14,155
Why throw it away by the river?

944
00:58:14,822 --> 00:58:16,449
I thought something had happened…

945
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:25,583
I'm sorry.

946
00:58:29,795 --> 00:58:30,755
Drink up.

947
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,344
I should turn myself in sober.

948
00:58:46,229 --> 00:58:50,483
Do you know what your grandparents
said to me most often?

949
00:58:52,944 --> 00:58:55,112
"You must listen
to both sides of the story."

950
00:58:56,155 --> 00:59:00,159
I needed a family who'd always
take my side no matter what.

951
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:04,580
So I told myself…

952
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:10,795
I should be a father who always
takes his child's side no matter what.

953
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:14,840
I told that to myself.

954
00:59:16,759 --> 00:59:19,720
Is that why you scratched me off the list
for the court training?

955
00:59:21,597 --> 00:59:23,224
Ms. Oh doesn't think

956
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:26,310
you plagiarized the paper.

957
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:30,064
That people forgot how smart you are
and jumped to conclusions.

958
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,358
Then all's good, right?

959
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:34,819
All's good?

960
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:37,488
What's the problem?

961
00:59:39,907 --> 00:59:41,951
Your name isn't on that list because…

962
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:50,251
you don't qualify.

963
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:54,672
A law professional who's smart
but doesn't qualify.

964
00:59:56,549 --> 00:59:58,467
Nothing's more dangerous than that.

965
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:07,560
Guys.

966
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:11,022
No matter what happens to Seung-jae,

967
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:13,190
let's all remember this.

968
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,611
We must help Ye-seul return to school.

969
01:00:17,987 --> 01:00:18,904
HELP YE-SEUL

970
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:20,406
Stop trying to shut me up.

971
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:22,617
Ye-seul, don't worry. I promise you…

972
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:27,163
-Joon-hwi and I--
-Why rope Joon-hwi into it?

973
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:29,540
Must you be so obvious
about not feeling confident?

974
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:30,958
It's not that.

975
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:33,210
My point is, we should all join forces

976
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:34,629
and do this together.

977
01:00:37,381 --> 01:00:38,674
Mr. Lee.

978
01:00:41,135 --> 01:00:44,472
Do you see this girl gloating here

979
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:48,017
after hurting my son like that?

980
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,310
Have you no shame?

981
01:00:49,393 --> 01:00:52,438
You should apologize to Yeong-chang
and reflect on what you did.

982
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:53,856
Mr. Lee.

983
01:00:54,857 --> 01:00:56,901
They're saying she cheated on him
with you.

984
01:00:56,984 --> 01:00:58,402
You should stay out of this.

985
01:01:08,371 --> 01:01:09,580
What's the matter, sir?

986
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:12,041
What have you been doing
to manage the law school?

987
01:01:12,124 --> 01:01:14,502
What a disgrace to Hankuk University.

988
01:01:14,585 --> 01:01:18,339
A professor is being tried for murder,
and a student for aggravated assault.

989
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:21,425
You should've attended the trial today.

990
01:01:21,509 --> 01:01:24,095
If Prof. Yang is found not guilty,

991
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:28,140
you'll be embarrassed of getting worked up
in front of the students.

992
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:29,058
What?

993
01:01:32,144 --> 01:01:35,231
I'm sorry for what happened to your son.

994
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:36,482
Then,

995
01:01:37,233 --> 01:01:40,569
you should not let this girl set foot
in school again.

996
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:44,365
Why are the professors and the students
trying to protect this criminal--

997
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:47,660
Let's wait and find out
whether she is a criminal or not.

998
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:54,959
Are you all here to help Ye-seul
prepare for her trial?

999
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:55,876
Yes, ma'am.

1000
01:02:00,965 --> 01:02:02,174
Let's go.

1001
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:08,389
Kang Sol!

1002
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:18,107
"Special defense counsel, self-defense."

1003
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:20,443
I heard that was all your idea.

1004
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:25,865
Running your mouth like that--

1005
01:02:25,948 --> 01:02:27,950
I will not regret it.

1006
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:32,496
I'm not Kang Dan
who regretted accepting your offer.

1007
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,622
What?

1008
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:37,042
Do you also like to install spy cams
like your son does?

1009
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,172
I really want to know how you found out

1010
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:42,882
that it was my idea.

1011
01:02:55,686 --> 01:02:59,523
The dean got on the wrong side
of the president and Ko Hyeong-su.

1012
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:03,194
Do a good job, or she'll be the first one
on the chopping block.

1013
01:03:03,986 --> 01:03:06,614
I can't believe she provoked them,
counting on you guys.

1014
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,657
You all heard that?

1015
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:10,785
Let's see if we can find
a lower court case

1016
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:12,787
like Ye-seul's
that was ruled self-defense.

1017
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:15,790
I'm out, as of today.

1018
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:17,708
I'm starting at Hyeongseol tomorrow.

1019
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:20,961
Why Hyeongseol?

1020
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:23,297
It's a great opportunity for Ji-ho.

1021
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,465
I'm okay.

1022
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:28,469
Don't worry about me.
Just do a good job and seal the deal.

1023
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,640
Good luck to you too,
but Hyeongseol won't be easy.

1024
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:33,724
Must you be so mean?

1025
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,978
When they're doing your reference check,
I'll tell them you're a jerk.

1026
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:40,147
You can't do that to your study mate.

1027
01:03:41,232 --> 01:03:43,484
Just don't join Ko Yeong-chang's counsel.

1028
01:03:44,276 --> 01:03:46,612
I feel like we're losing
a thousand soldiers,

1029
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:49,865
but show them what you can do.

1030
01:03:51,909 --> 01:03:53,160
I'll do a good job.

1031
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,872
Do you really want to threaten me
with a reference check

1032
01:03:56,956 --> 01:03:58,249
in front of Ye-seul?

1033
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:00,417
God, that jerk!

1034
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:01,836
I can't stand him.

1035
01:04:02,419 --> 01:04:04,046
I'm not jealous, you know.

1036
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:06,048
I found a case.

1037
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,026
I'm here.

1038
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:39,665
I arrived just now.

1039
01:04:57,946 --> 01:05:03,938

<i>Prof. Yang gave it to me</i>

1041
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:17,369
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>he purposely gave it to me?</i>

1042
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:20,915
It means someone instigated
the culprit to kill me.

1043
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:24,501
<i>-It's different from the deal we made!</i>

1044
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:26,754
<i>How dare you come here?</i>

1045
01:05:26,837 --> 01:05:28,756
<i>You want to write an article about Mr. Ko?</i>

1046

<i>I'll help you report exclusive news.</i>

What?

1048
01:05:32,176 --> 01:05:34,553
<i>The prosecutor offered to suspend</i>
<i>his indictment.</i>

1049
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:37,264
You won't be able to control Seung-jae
as you want.

1050
01:05:37,348 --> 01:05:39,016
<i>Prof. Yang found it out only now?</i>

1051
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:41,977
Therefore, according to Article 258
of the Criminal Code,

1052
01:05:42,061 --> 01:05:45,064
the defendant is indicted
for grievous bodily harm.
