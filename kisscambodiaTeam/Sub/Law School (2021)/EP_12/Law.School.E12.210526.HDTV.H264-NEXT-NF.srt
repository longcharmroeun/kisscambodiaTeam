00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,542
Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

5
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,920
You can't do this to me!

6
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,004
Let go…

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,592
That's not enough to kill him.

8
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:34,593
Damn it.

9
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:38,430
Choke him harder!

DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

12
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,735
Is the defense counsel not here yet?

13
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,279
ACCUSED

14
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:01,161
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

15
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,834
Don't come closer.

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,046
Kill him!

17
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,678
Get that out of my face.

18
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,304
I said, get it out of my face!

19
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:20,264
Come on!

20
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,142
Finish him up and rot in jail
until you die…

21
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,435
as a murderer.

22
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,644
Get lost!

23
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,814
Professor Yang.

24
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,524
-Damn it!
-Hey.

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,693
What? Hey!

26
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,666
Had he actually killed me,

27
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,003
you would've been charged
for incitement to murder as well.

28
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:52,629
Incitement to murder?

29
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,257
I showed you that
he has no intention of killing you.

30
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,219
Would he kill someone
wearing a GPS ankle bracelet?

31
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,346
He wouldn't.

32
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,766
He does not want to go back to jail.

33
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:08,145
Delete that.

34
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,063
About the medical certificate.

35
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:14,109
The one that says there's a slim chance
your son's right arm and leg will recover.

36
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:15,819
What about it?

37
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,821
You and the hospital president are close.

38
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:21,742
Did you ask him to write it like that
to screw my client over?

39
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,703
Although he can recover
with physical rehabilitation.

40
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,582
That's right.
That's who you're dealing with here.

41
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,628
So cut the self-defense crap.

42
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:36,048
If that stupid girl says
she will gladly accept her punishment,

43
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:40,385
I'll, at least, spare her
from a harsh sentence.

44
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:56,652
Shit.

45
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,953
<i>Width, 13cm. Length, 30cm.</i>
<i>They're for a shoe size of 275mm.</i>

46
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,373
Size 275mm.

47
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,792
Hey.

48
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:14,920
Why would you catch me?

49
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,589
Because I want to ask you something.

50
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:19,967
I've been meaning to visit you.

51
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,221
This.

52
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,392
It's my uncle's.

53
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,853
But someone did this.

54
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,774
<i>My daughter did as her mom said.</i>

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,239
What about it?

56
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,283
What you want to ask is "How."

57
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,618
Isn't that what you want to know?

58
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:48,537
How this ended up in my hands.

59
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:52,416
Prof. Yang gave it to me.

60
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:54,876
He said it was my uncle's.

61
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,218
Catch you later.

62
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,559
They're tracking you anyway.

63
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:12,019
See you at the police station.

64
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:21,528
Witness.

COURT

66
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:26,408
You went to the hospital
upon receiving the defendant's call.

67
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,285
Yes, the emergency room.

68
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,330
Who was with the defendant at the time?

69
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,664
Han Joon-hwi was with her.

70
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:33,999
JUROR

71
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:36,251
Just Han Joon-hwi and no one else?

72
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:37,753
Correct.

73
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,631
Did they seem pretty close?

74
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,091
I thought they were dating.

75
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,760
He was very protective of her.

76
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:48,597
No further questions.

00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,565
No questions, Your Honor.

I'll go testify.

JUROR

90
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,283
I won't show the photos on the screen

91
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,745
because they'll remind the defendant
of the painful memories.

EVIDENCE FOR ASSAULT

93
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,379
Witness, you're the doctor
who issued her this medical certificate.

94
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:03,964
Correct.

95
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:06,883
Were these bruises caused by being beaten?

96
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,093
Yes, that is correct.

97
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:09,636
How badly was she beaten?

98
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,515
Worse than this?

99
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,308
Yes.

100
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:17,102
PROSECUTION

101
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,895
JUROR

102
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,359
Someone kicked me,
and it was very painful.

103
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,987
I can't imagine how painful
that must've been.

104
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:31,199
LEFT SHOULDER, LEFT EYE, LEFT WRIST

105
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:35,245
-Objection.
-Can you imagine the pain?

106
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,039
Do you have evidence to prove
that Mr. Ko hit her?

107
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,791
Do you have evidence to refute it?

108
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,336
Up until the medical certificate
was issued, she was always with him.

109
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,673
The text messages and the photos here
prove that.

110
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:51,636
But none of them states or shows
that he physically assaulted her.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,222
We can't assume he assaulted her
just based on the fact

112
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:56,391
that she was with him
before seeing the doctor.

113
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:59,144
What if she saw no one else
before going to the doctor's?

114
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,229
JUROR

115
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:07,694
Did she have company the first time
she visited your clinic?

116
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,070
Yes, she did.

117
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,113
Who was it?

118
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,699
From what I recall, it was her boyfriend.

119
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:16,620
"Boyfriend"? Are you referring
to Mr. Ko Yeong-chang, the victim?

120
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:19,498
I actually checked before coming here.

121
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:23,126
The name on the credit card
was Ko Yeong-chang.

122
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,586
I see.

123
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,839
What did Mr. Ko say to you that day?

124
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,050
He was very angry.

125
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,051
JUROR

126
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,595
He said his girlfriend was assaulted
by her stalker.

127
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:36,556
He asked for a medical certificate
proving bodily harm.

128
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,853
Knowing the assaulter could be prosecuted
even if the victim agreed to a settlement?

129
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:42,771
Yes.

130
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,482
How did the defendant react to that?

131
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,692
She didn't really say anything,

132
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,861
so I issued a certificate
proving bodily harm.

133
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:53,240
Did you, by any chance,
suspect that he might be the person

134
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:55,784
who assaulted her?

135
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,203
No, I never thought that.

136
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:00,163
Did you hear that?

137
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:05,252
Mr. Ko wasn't the assaulter
who caused her to go to the hospital.

138
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,755
In fact, he took her there
as her guardian.

139
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,715
MARCH 26, 2020

140
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,633
Get out.

141
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,761
A FEW MONTHS
BEFORE THE KO YEONG-CHANG INCIDENT

142
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:17,764
Ye-seul.

143
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,226
Let's get you treated
and get a medical certificate.

144
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,230
I'm a complete asshole if I do this again.

145
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:26,898
If this happens again,

146
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,443
use the medical certificate
and file charges against me.

147
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,113
Okay?

148
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,369
Let's go.

149
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,420
EVIDENCE FOR ASSAULT

150
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,046
Nonsense.

151
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,840
He took her there after hitting her.

152
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:54,050
Juror no. 4, please be quiet.

153
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,012
The jurors are not permitted to speak
during the trial.

154

If you have a question or anything to say,

155
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,850
please write it down and submit it.

158
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,775
Looks like Juror no. 4
is on Ye-seul's side.

159
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:22,537
Weren't you aware that
the content of your post was defamatory?

160
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,789
I had no other option.

161
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:27,792
Had they paid child support
as they promised--

162
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:31,546
So you deliberately humiliated them
to force them into giving the money?

163
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,756
Is that it?

164
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:35,550
I want to ask them

165
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:40,972
why they're refusing to pay child support
for their own child.

166
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,558
-What brings you here?
-The kids did nothing wrong.

167
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:47,479
Our Legal Clinic is helping the defendant.

168
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:49,940
I see.

169
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,484
What about your son's trial?

170
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:58,239
I get that they hate me,
but why take it out on the kids?

171
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:06,998
<i>Nonsense.</i>

172
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,668
He took her there after hitting her.

173
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,006
I feel bad that Mom has to see this.

174
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,719
-No! Stay away from me!
-Open the door!

175
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,596
I said, open the door!

176
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,973
-Stop.
-Let go.

177
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,433
-Don't touch me.
-I'll kill him.

178
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,604
I told you to stop!

181
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:50,917
What?

182
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,420
You don't want to watch the trial?

183
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,546
I should watch it.

184
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,008
Because of Juror no. 4?

185
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,011
I thought she looked familiar.

186
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,222
I never forget a face.

187
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:16,860
<i>Your Honor.</i>

188
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,905
This witness examination will be focused
on how Mr. Ko sexually assaulted Ms. Jeon.

189
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:23,533
It will bring back the painful memories,

190
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,578
so please allow Ms. Jeon
to leave the courtroom for a moment.

191
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:29,664
This is an aggravated assault trial,
not sexual assault.

192
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:32,083
Which wouldn't have taken place
had it not been for

193
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,668
the sexual assault and the video.

194

COURT

195
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:38,465
Ms. Jeon should be protected
as a sexual assault victim.

196
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,717
This claim cannot be sustained.

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,803
We do not agree that the defendant
should be seen as a victim.

You performed a rape kit
on Ms. Jeon, correct?

Yes.

JUROR 2

210
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:14,209
Joon-hwi said Juror no. 2
will be a wild card.

211
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,044
But aren't you getting a bad feeling?

212
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:21,758
You've examined
a number of rape victims, right?

213
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,221
Yes, I'm usually the one
who handles it at our hospital.

214
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:27,764
The day Mr. Ko was injured,

215
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,142
the defendant was also brought
to the hospital and was examined by you.

216
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,060
Yes.

217
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,437
As an experienced medical professional,

218
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,816
do you believe that
she was raped by Mr. Ko?

219
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:38,900
JUROR NO. 2

220
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:42,695
First and foremost, Ms. Jeon

221
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,073
seemed very nervous
when I first examined her.

222
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:48,952
In the examination, I noticed a few things
that would not have occurred

223
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,246
had she willfully engaged
in consensual sex.

224
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:54,207
Such as defensive injuries that occurred
while struggling?

225
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,500
The question is leading.

226
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,922
What are these "few things"
you're referring to?

227
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:03,716
There were abrasions and bruises
on her arms and legs.

228
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,386
Mr. Ko's skin cells were found
under her fingernails,

229
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:09,973
and there were signs of genital
and vaginal trauma. Based on such--

230
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,268
Can't they happen
during a couple's sexual activities

231
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,271
that are sadistic or rough?

232
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:18,231
But normally--

233
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:20,108
Yes or no?

234
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,443
Yes.

235
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:26,865
Everyone has a different palate,
and the same goes for sexual taste.

236
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:28,616
That is true.

237
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,326
That's right.

238
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,455
They mutually decided to record themselves
on video while having sex.

239
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,918
So why claim that he raped her
and recorded the video secretly…

240
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,296
Oh, sorry.

241
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,174
Your bullshit made me choke.

242
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,425
COURT

243
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,722
Now, let's talk about whether or not
the video was secretly recorded.

244
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,600
In other countries,
failure to pay child support

245
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,895
could be considered child abuse
and may lead to criminal penalties.

246
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,939
It is a crime that threatens
the child's right to life.

247
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,526
Failure to pay child support
infringes on the child's right to life.

248
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,780
Therefore, it is different
from other financial obligations.

249
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,325
Their personal information was published,

250
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,203
but since they are threatening
their children's right to life,

251
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,038
they brought it upon themselves.

252
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,458
They should have the decency
to pay child support if they can afford

253
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,001
a lawsuit like this.

254
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:23,379
They're not deliberately withholding
payment. They don't have the money--

255
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:27,008
The website was created because
of bad parents who can pay it but don't.

The prosecutor insists
it was recorded with consent,

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:07,567
so we'll call it "the video."

JUROR

00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,070
The defendant received the video

She was so shocked
that she fainted right away.

290
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:40,141
Did you know then that
it was a secretly recorded sex video?

291
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,559
I could only guess.

292
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,729
Ye-seul was panicking,
so I couldn't ask her.

WITNESS

294
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,776
If it was recorded with her consent
like the prosecutor is insisting,

295
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,695
would she have reacted that way
upon receiving it?

296

JUROR

297
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:57,533
-Because it was secretly recorded--
-We can't conclude that the reaction

298
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,787
was caused by the video
based on this footage alone.

299
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,917
Witness, you ran to the hospital
with Ms. Jeon on your back

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,336
when the ambulance could've taken her.

301
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:10,671
Yes.

302
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,841
And you were with her the whole time
she was at the hospital.

303
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:15,551
Yes.

304
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,804
I also heard you asked a friend

305
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:22,100
to check on the defendant's room
after the incident.

PROSECUTION

307
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,143
Yes.

308
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:25,978
That was to ensure they wouldn't think

309
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:28,481
that she might flee
or try to destroy evidence.

310
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:32,235
You were afraid she'd be detained
or arrested without a warrant.

311
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,487
That's why you went all out
to protect her.

312
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:39,659
Then based on that, wouldn't anyone assume
that they're very close?

313
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:43,204
I wanted to protect her from abuse.
If you think I went "all out"…

314
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:45,915
Sure, I did it to protect her.

315
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:51,003
I stopped Assemblyman Ko when he tried
to slap her in the face at the hospital.

316
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:56,759
But even if it was another friend,
I'd never let something like that happen.

317

JUROR

318
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,679
I'd never let a friend suffer injustice.

319
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,598
Here, what were you and Ms. Jeon
talking about?

320
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,852
Must I tell you everything?

321
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,855
Let me rephrase that
if you're uncomfortable answering it.

322
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:13,276
At the time, did you know
that she was planning to testify

323
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,360
in Mr. Yang's trial?

324
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,156
I was guessing she might.

325
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,866
So you didn't know for sure.

326
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:24,620
Earlier, you said you had guessed
it might be a secretly recorded video.

327
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,873
That means you didn't know for sure.

328
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,251
I guess not.

329
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,210
COURT

330
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,338
As a law student,
shouldn't you have refrained

331
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:37,758
from testifying if it was something
you weren't sure about?

332
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:42,013
It could incite the jurors
to jump to conclusions.

333
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:46,267
You're right.

334
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,853
If I taught criminal law
at Hankuk University,

335
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:52,148
I'd teach such basics first.
He didn't teach you this?

336
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,531
The way the two of you
exchanged glances just now

337
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,909
makes me think that you two
must be very close.

338
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:05,995
I'd like you all to remember this.

339
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,538
JUROR

340
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,041
There, what did you give her?

341
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,295
A pledge.

342
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:18,382
Mr. Ko signed a pledge that he'd never
sneak into her room again.

343
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,843
Why is it that you got it from Mr. Ko?

344
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,846
You said you and Ms. Jeon
are just friends.

345
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:29,185
-That's--
-What did you say when you handed it over?

346
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,438
"You should listen to Prof. Yang,
not Yeong-chang.

347
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:35,107
You must listen to your professor
to survive law school."

348
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:37,693
If Ms. Jeon, who was taken aback
by that remark…

349
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,778
CAN WE MEET NOW?

350
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:42,990
…happened to see this text message
from Mr. Yang, her professor,

351
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,409
she must've been terrified, right?

352
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,499
That is why she dropped her phone
and panicked.

353
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:52,416
JUROR

354
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:55,628
-Objection, Your Honor--
-Really?

355
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,464
I thought you'd say "No objection"
or "No questions" again.

356
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,967
Why did you ask her to meet up
at that late hour?

357
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:06,305
Why did he want to see his student
who was going to testify against him?

358
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,934
After this, Ms. Jeon changed her mind.

359
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:13,104
So to thank her,
you volunteered to represent her.

360
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,773
Isn't that why you're here?

361
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,276
JUROR

362
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,944
JUROR

363
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:25,950
Excuse me.

364
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,368
JUROR 4

365
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:28,411
The restroom…

366
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,665
We were all totally focused.
Must you interrupt the flow like this?

367
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,376
We don't have time.
Can't we just continue?

368
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,420
Could you wait?

369
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:39,088
No…

370
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,176
COURT

371
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,345
We'll take a 30-minute recess.

372
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,186
WITNESS, JUROR

373
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,566
JUROR

374
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:01,485
I had a bad hunch when I heard her name,
Bae Sim-won.

375
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,487
She'll be a hard one to beat.

376
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:04,905
The jurors seem persuaded.

377
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:08,200
Don't we need a forensic investigation
to prove what Ye-seul saw

378
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:10,411
in the lobby was indeed the spy cam video?

379
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:12,830
Hey, you. Why are you here?

380
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:14,540
What? Why?

381
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:16,876
Come with me.

382
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,544
Come on. Quick.

383
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:20,755
Come here. Listen.

384
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:23,049
Go to Mirinae Middle School.

385
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,635
Pick up this kid
and take him to his academy.

386
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,053
What?

387
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,555
Go. He's a school violence assailant.
I must get him.

388
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,682
Shouldn't the police catch him?

389
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:34,560
We don't need to "catch" him.
I just want the case.

390
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,313
I can charge a lot
for school violence cases.

391
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,230
Oh, I see.

392
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:41,192
His mother said she'll hire us
if we help her with this.

393
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:43,110
Hey, get going.

394
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:45,154
Now? Ye-seul's trial isn't over yet.

395
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,656
Hey, this is part of your internship.

396
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,116
Hurry.

397
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,660
-But…
-Hurry, go!

398
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,496
Drive safely, okay?

399
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:55,664
But…

400
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:02,671
KO HYEONG-SU SUPPORTS BAD FAMA

401
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,383
So many people have read this
and commented on it.

402
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,134
Thanks to you, Choi scored big.

403
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:09,303
All the other reporters wasted their time.

404
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,222
He acted as though he wouldn't cover it.

405
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,265
I told you he would, 100 percent.

406
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:16,268
We have the recording,
so he can no longer use Prosecutor Jin.

407
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:18,562
Thank God the police think
he should be indicted.

408
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:22,441
I told you that they would.
They had to, because of the recording.

409
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,402
Prosecutors are the problem.

410
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:25,986
They'll defend their colleague.

411
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,738
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

412
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,700
At the moment, you're one of us.

413
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,459
You're interning under my supervision.

414
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,717
I take my <i>ramyeon</i> very seriously.

415
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:51,262
You can drink the broth.

416
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:53,931
KO HYEONG-SU SUPPORTS BAD FAMA

417
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,977
Kiddos, stop trying to mess with me.

418
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:02,940
They say,
"Once a family, always a family."

419
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,442
So I'll let him off this once.

420
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:06,569
But you will be hurt.

421
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:11,073
If you keep messing with me,
you'll regret it big time.

422
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,037
It was 275.

423
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,375
Not 270.

424
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,587
The shoe size of the real culprit.

425
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:30,342
Since you're my supervisor now,
let's catch the killer together.

426
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:34,180
It'd be embarrassing for the prosecution
to bark up the wrong tree.

427
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:39,059
Have some rice with the broth
that I left for you.

428
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,271
Shouldn't you be suspicious of it by now?

429
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,948
The needle mark on his stomach
that wasn't from an insulin injection.

430
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:54,658
Being stabbed

431
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:58,871
with this needle right here
would puncture the stomach, right?

432
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:01,790
Yes, it would.

433
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:06,545
I'm under a lot of stress
because of my trial.

434
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:07,922
Please don't visit me again.

435
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,674
Did you see a puncture wound
in his stomach?

436
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:15,638
No, not during my examination.

437
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,140
It was already quite damaged
from the first autopsy.

438
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,768
What exactly do you mean?

439
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:27,274
Because of you, I was nearly convicted
of murdering my own uncle.

440
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:31,153
Please tell me the truth.

441
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:38,494
I think I heard someone talking about
a puncture wound in the stomach

442
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,121
when I went in there briefly
during the first autopsy.

443
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:44,375
<i>That is not true. He just gave you</i>
<i>the answer that you wanted.</i>

444
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,501
And to get that answer,

445
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,128
-you said you'd file a petition for him.
-A petition?

446
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:51,340
If the victim files a petition
requesting leniency for him,

447
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,717
he may be let off with a fine
instead of probation.

448
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:56,345
To a mere civil servant
at the National Forensic Service,

449
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,180
that is a matter of livelihood.

450
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:03,894
To keep his job, he had no choice,
but to give you the answer you wanted.

451
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:13,279
Why not lash out at me if he's that angry?

452
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,739
Why did he have to treat me
as if I was invisible?

453
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:19,910
The thought of becoming a prosecutor

454
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:21,954
is scaring me
for the first time in my life.

455
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,962
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

457
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,720
Have you eaten…

458
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:40,097
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

459
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,560
Did he just flat out ignore you?

460
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,228
He wants nothing to do with you.

461
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:50,441
It's not like we wanted that conversation
to be recorded.

462
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,904
What's with that scoop?
You didn't even tell me.

463
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,114
What?

464
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:59,700
WORLD WITHOUT CORRUPTION

465
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:02,077
<i>How can this be part of the internship?</i>

466
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,706
I get that school violence cases
pay a lot, but I'm not his driver.

467
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:08,959
Lawyers bust their butt to get clients.
This is hands-on experience.

468
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,669
-I have to go.
-<i>Hey, Bok-gi.</i>

469
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:13,422
At least, Mr. Park gives you stuff to do.

470
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,507
Prosecutor Jin would only talk
to Joon-hwi.

471
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:17,176
To him, I'm practically invisible.

472
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,802
Want to be Mr. Park's driver then?

473
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:23,766
Why did I want to become a lawyer?
I'm fundamentally regretting my decision.

474
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:27,227
AT LEFT TURN SIGNAL
AT PEDESTRIAN CROSSING

475
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:34,943
I mean, Ye-seul' trial is taking place
right now.

476
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,945
I should be there.

477
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,864
I'll try to keep you in the loop.

478
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:47,247
Everything was going great
until the press conference, but…

479
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,832
NICE JOB, HAEWON DAILY

480
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:52,878
People were so supportive,
but they've suddenly gone cold.

481
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:57,716
Why did you have to ruin everything
for me?

482
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,178
What were you thinking
when you hired a jerk who refused

483
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,554
to pay child support?

484
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:09,103
Oh, don't get me wrong.

485
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:12,564
I only found out today
that he's representing your son.

486
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,949
Here are some precedents
that could be helpful for Ye-seul.

487
00:27:28,706 --> 00:27:30,541
This one's very recent.

488
00:27:30,624 --> 00:27:32,543
She said to the police
she didn't report it

489
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:34,294
because she feared retaliation,

490
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:36,755
but she told the prosecutor
that love was the reason.

491
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,299
Such inconsistency could put her
at a disadvantage.

492
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:41,969
You found a case where the court

493
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:44,471
ruled in favor of a rape victim
despite inconsistency.

494
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,474
This will be very useful.

495
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:55,649
Hello.

496
00:27:58,986 --> 00:27:59,945

498
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,659
I heard you didn't get
the court internship.

499
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:06,869
Right.

500
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,371
Do you think it was because
of the plagiarism scandal?

501
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,123
About that…

502
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,167
I told Prof. Kim

503
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,837
that your conviction is dangerous.
You only see what you want to see.

504
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,423
That's not a fair statement
as I have a smoking gun.

505
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:23,427
Go public with it.

506
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,720
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CONTEST

507
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,263
That person doesn't want to,

508
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,725
so you can get another chance.

509
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:45,955
Attorney Song, this crazy idiot.

510
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,395
I can't believe

511
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:01,648
you withheld child support of all things.

512
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:02,941
Oh, that was…

513
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,652
I got it all resolved recently.

514
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:09,531
You're off the case as of this moment.

515
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,325
Sir.

516
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:25,172
I attended the Bad FaMa trial
to divert media attention,

517
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:29,384
but the reporters ended up flocking
to my son's trial because of you!

518
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,970
My apologies, sir.

519
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:34,806
Get lost.

520
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:39,436
Don't even loiter around the courtroom
for my son's trial.

521
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:45,650
There's an issue with the jurors.

522
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,528
The jurors?

523
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,416
<i>Are you all right?</i>

524
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,334
SOL

525
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,803
MOM
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

526
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:14,304
Why isn't she replying?

527
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:17,724
It's not like I can go talk to her.
This is frustrating.

528
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:30,320
Hey.

529
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,531
About last time…

530
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:37,035
Now, I know why you want to be
a prosecutor.

531
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,918
Your penetrating question got me
and my conscience.

532
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:05,939
Tell Prof. Yang I found out
what time Ye-seul first saw the video.

533
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:15,532
-My gosh.
-Hello.

534
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:16,741
Hello.

535
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:20,662
The trial seems to be going well,
thanks to Prof. Kim's testimony.

536
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:25,750
Even if I don't get acquitted, I want
to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

537
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:28,545
You helped me the most.

538
00:31:28,628 --> 00:31:29,838
I didn't even do much.

539
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:33,925
If you are found guilty,
you can file an appeal.

540
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,305
But the prosecutor can do the same
even if I am found not guilty,

541
00:31:38,388 --> 00:31:40,599
so I really hope they pass the bill.

542
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,517
The one Assemblyman Ko proposed today

543
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,937
for abolishing the current defamation law
for publicly alleging facts.

544
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,355
That bill is…

545
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:53,403
I promise you that I will fight with you
until the end.

546
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,198
-We got this.
-We got this.

547
00:31:56,907 --> 00:32:00,076
Right, it'd be nice
if they passed that bill.

548
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:01,953
No.

549
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:04,372
But I refuse to support Ko Hyeong-su.

550
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:06,833
What?

551
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:10,295
I'm also against punishing those
who tell the truth

552
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,631
and think the defamation law
should be abolished.

553
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,092
But I'm really against Ko Hyeong-su
getting credit for it.

554
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:17,719
I can't let that happen.

555
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:19,679
So what's your point?

556
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,431
My point?

557
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:23,642
So I'm going to…

558
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,770
Why isn't she texting me back?

Where's Prof. Yang?

571
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,263
-I thought you guys were with him.
-No.

572
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:47,183
Maybe he's pulling his hair out somewhere
because Prosecutor Bae got him good.

573
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:50,020
Based on the evidence so far,
it'll be difficult for Ye-seul

574
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:53,273
to prove that she was trying to stop him
from disseminating…

575
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,190
What?

Are you going to have Seung-jae
testify for her?

I don't want to be on the witness stand.

DON'T FORGET THIS LONG NIGHT WE HAD
MY HUBBY

583
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:02,217
Are you saying you just helped Ms. Jeon
with her studies because you two

584
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,846
were in the same study group?
You're just friends and nothing more?

585
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,515
Correct.

586
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:11,559
In the group, there is someone
who I really want to look out for,

587
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,645
but it's not Ye-seul.

588

JUROR

589
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:18,525
It's someone in the study group?
Then the person must be here.

590
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:21,986
Everyone in the group is here
to help Ms. Jeon.

591
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:26,032
-Yes.
-Who is it?

592
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,038
Tell us who it is.

593
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:37,001
You can tell us unless this is a trick
to hide your relationship with Ms. Jeon.

594
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:02,152
Where is it?

595
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,487
How dare you touch my stuff?

596
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:06,197
I have no power, you see.

597
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:08,032
All I did was carry out the orders.

598
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:11,035
-Hey.
-Get lost!

599
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:13,913
Damn it!

600
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:16,833
Shit.

601
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:18,835
JIN HYEONG-U

602
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:20,545
Shit.

603
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:23,631
YANG JONG-HOON

604
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,216
Damn.

605
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,438
If your Bad FaMa client
is found not guilty,

606
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,940
you'll have me to thank for.

607
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:44,527
So I have to say I was pretty upset
when you brought up Attorney Song.

608
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:51,743
But I hope…

609
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:57,207
you're not going to break your promise
just because of that.

610
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,044
The promise you made
upon receiving the Lee Man-ho bill.

611
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:02,462
Of course, I won't.

612
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:04,964
I even got choked by him
while provoking him

613
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,758
with the recording that you had sent.

614
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:09,177
You must keep the promise

615
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,263
even if someone threatens you
with a knife.

616
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:13,640
Yes, of course.

617
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,226
As long as

618
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:20,355
Yang Jong-hoon isn't the one
holding the knife.

619
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,815
Don't drag me into his problem.

620
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,869
I have to go watch your son's trial.
Well, then.

621
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,915
-Shall we head out together?
-Go ahead.

622
00:37:43,002 --> 00:37:43,836
Hey.

623
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:45,880
What?

624
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:02,230
JAMES

625
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:04,346
Hi! How's it going?

626
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,515
<i>I'm doing great. How are you?</i>

627
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,059
-I'm fine.
<i>-Are you busy right now?</i>

628
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:13,324
Ms. Jeon, you're studying law
to become a law professional.

629
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:14,450
Right?

630
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,952
WITNESS

631
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:16,911
Yes.

632
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,454
Then I'm sure

633
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:21,666
you were fully aware that filming someone
without their consent,

634
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:25,378
especially during sex,
is considered a serious criminal offense.

635
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:29,048
Yes.

636
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,801
If Mr. Ko physically abused you
and also filmed you

637
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:35,388
without your consent,
why didn't you report it to the police?

638
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:44,606
As someone who is studying to work in law,
why didn't she report such a crime?

639
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:48,776
Especially when she has a history

640
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,321
of filing a police report
against a college friend

641
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:53,740
who stalked her
before she started law school.

642
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:55,950
JUROR

643
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:00,997
What's going on?

644
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,498
-Who's that?
-Ko Yeong-chang!

645
00:39:02,582 --> 00:39:03,541
-What?
-Mr. Ko.

646
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,168
-Ko Yeong-chang, right?
-Mr. Ko!

647
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:06,961
-Mr. Ko.
-Why is he here?

648
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,630
-Mr. Ko.
-Is it really him?

649
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,214
Mr. Ko, how are you feeling?

650
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:11,591
-Mr. Ko!
-Please step back.

651
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:12,550
Just a comment!

652
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:13,468
Please step back.

653
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,303
-What's going on?
-My apologies.

654
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,764
The victim wanted to be here,
so I brought him.

655
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,269
Prosecutor, please continue.

656
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:30,526
WITNESS

657
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,279
You can have some water before you answer.

658
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,369
According to your statement,

659
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:42,497
you didn't report him to the police
because you loved him.

660
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,457
Was that the reason?

661
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:49,671
You put up with the sexual assault
because you loved him?

662
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,216
That doesn't make much sense.

663
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:58,554
But if this statement is true,
you loved him enough to put up with it.

664
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:02,767
Then it's understandable
that you totally lost it and attacked him

665
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,520
the moment you heard him say
he wanted to end things.

666
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:09,732
-That is total baloney.
-That is total baloney.

667
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:11,567
Hoping he'd let you go unpunished

668
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:13,945
for the injuries you had inflicted
upon him,

669
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:17,740
are you now saying you were raped
though you actually had sex with him?

670
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:23,121
Her claim that she kept quiet out of love
is not true.

671
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:27,458
She had no reason to report him
in the first place

672
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:31,462
because Mr. Ko never assaulted her
in any way.

673
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:34,382
Defendant.

674
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:37,844
Calm down and return to your seat.

675
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:45,017
COURT

676
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:48,855
If you leave the courtroom now,
it may be used against you.

677
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,446
Please make that jerk leave the courtroom!

678
00:40:56,529 --> 00:40:59,490
Juror no. 4, if you speak
without permission one more time,

679
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,826
-you'll be asked to leave.
-Tell her to leave now.

680
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:07,165
I request we take a recess.

681
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:08,332
Let's just continue.

682
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,461
JUROR

683
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:12,420
Your Honor.

684
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:15,047
COURT

685
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,218
I'd like to give Ye-seul what she wants.

686
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:22,138
Mr. Ko, I will give you a chance
to speak--

687
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:23,222
It's okay.

688
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,808
I have nothing to say.

689
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:29,103
Ye-seul and I were going to get married.

690
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:32,648
But just because she cheated on me
with a smarter guy at the law school

691
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:35,943
and let her professor threaten her
and toy with her,

692
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:40,907
I wanted to end things.
So it is my own fault.

693
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:46,078
I understand why she got so angry
and lashed out at me.

694
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:48,289
Your Honor.

695
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:51,667
Please just give her what she wants.

696
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,506
If she can be happy,

697
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,007
I'll gladly

698
00:41:59,175 --> 00:42:02,261
be called a rapist.

699
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,765
Jeez, that douchebag is really something.

700
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:06,766
JUROR

701
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:08,976
Half of my body is paralyzed now anyway,

702
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,604
so I don't care if people call me
a shameless criminal.

703
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:16,150
I just feel horrible, thinking about
what my father might have to go through

704
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,153
because of his stupid son
who was crazy about his girlfriend…

705
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,825
Hurry. Take him back to the hospital.

706
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,117
-What?
-Wait, hold on!

707
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:26,786
-Mr. Ko!
-Out of the way, please.

708
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:28,454
-Hurry.
-Just a comment, please!

709
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:29,956
-Mr. Ko!
-Just a comment!

710

-Mr. Ko!
-Wait!

711
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,000
-All right.
-Tell us about your condition!

712
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,043
Order.

713
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:34,961
-Wait!
-Mr. Ko!

714
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:37,505
-Just a comment, please!
-Wait, Mr. Ko!

715
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,215
-One moment!
-Mr. Ko, are you okay?

716
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:44,679
HOW DID THE REPORTER FIND OUT ABOUT THIS?

717
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,806
NICE JOB, HAEWON DAILY

718
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,686
-Wait!
-Just a moment!

719
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,437
-One moment!
-Are you okay?

720
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:54,897
Tell us about your condition.

721
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:56,315
-Wait! Stop!
-Who's that?

722
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:57,483
Ko Hyeong-su's son.

723
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,235
-Ko Hyeong-su?
-How are you feeling?

724
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:00,528
-What?
-How do you feel?

725
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,905
-Just a comment, please!
-Are you okay?

726
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:04,115
-Wait!
-Mr. Ko!

Prof. Kim.

730
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:29,974
I don't want to do this anymore.

731

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

732
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:53,164
I have to say, provoking Assemblyman Ko
helped me score big.

733
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:55,041
If you want something bigger…

734
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:01,631
What's this?

735
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,676
Give a statement to the prosecutor.

736
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,761
Now?

737
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:09,597
-If you hand over that photo.
-After you give

738
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,057
-your statement.
-Hey.

739
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,019
He's pissed you're scoring all the scoops.

740
00:44:15,811 --> 00:44:16,812
Where are you going?

741
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,564
All scoops are exclusive.

742
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:20,941
So first, let's--

743
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,943
Then Reporter Kim can score them all.

744
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,362
Mr. Kim.

745
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:26,489
It's nothing. Hey, let's talk.

746

JUROR

747
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:35,039
Counsel, you may continue
to examine the defendant.

748
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:43,898
I am afraid

749
00:44:44,524 --> 00:44:46,359
I can no longer represent Ms. Jeon.

750
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:53,568
DEFENSE COUNSEL

751
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,236
I am afraid

752
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:57,697
I can no longer represent Ms. Jeon.

753
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,993
JUROR

754
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:06,247
What's going on?

755
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,457
I beg your pardon?

756
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,042
PROSECUTION

757
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:12,170
I resign.

Counsel.

759
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:17,634
What is this about?

760
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:19,677
Is this some kind of joke?

761
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:23,556
You requested to be Ms. Jeon's
special defense counsel.

762
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,933
I apologize, Your Honor.

763
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:29,854
I wish to stop defending her
so that she can exercise

764
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:33,525
her right to defend herself.

765
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:35,693

767
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:47,497
Am I your teacher?

768
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:51,000
What are you doing?

769
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:53,294
We'll begin.

770
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:57,966
Case number 2020-GH311.

771
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:00,051
Ms. Jeon and Mr. Ko
were in a relationship.

772
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:02,887
Jeon was indicted for inflicting
serious injuries on Ko

773
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,682
during their heated argument
about a video of their sex.

774
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:08,726
However, Jeon insists that
she acted in self-defense

775
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,604
while trying to stop Ko
from disseminating the video.

776
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,022
What is the main issue here?

777
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,399
PROSECUTION

778
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,028
What is the main issue?

779
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:26,161
COURT

780
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:31,416
Depending on the results of our trials,

781
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:32,959
this could be our last class.

782
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,753
So I expect your full participation.

783
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,176
WITNESS

784
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,844
The main issue…

785
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,139
JUROR

786
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:48,516
It's whether or not the video

787
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:51,394
was recorded secretly.

788
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:52,937
-That's it?
-Pardon me?

789
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,773
Is that enough for her to claim
she acted in self-defense?

790
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:01,571
Also whether he tried
to disseminate the video…

791
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:03,489
Why do the prosecutors disagree?

792
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:05,033
PROSECUTION

793
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:08,953
-After watching the video, I--
-Ms. Jeon.

794
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:11,831
She didn't get angry at him…

795
00:47:13,374 --> 00:47:17,003
She neither got angry at Ko
nor told him to delete the video.

796
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:18,004
JUROR

797
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,632
When he texted her and asked
if she had watched it,

798
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:24,761
she wrote back "yeah" instead of "yes".

799
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:29,599
<i>-Did you watch it?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

800
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:32,435
What's wrong with writing "yeah"
instead of "yes"?

801
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:35,230
That's…

802
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:38,107
"Yeah" connotes closeness.

803
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:42,487
It's not a reaction expected from someone
who's shocked after watching such a video.

804
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,448
TEXT CONVERSATION

00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:50,495
one of my peers asked me out.

807
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:52,914
I rejected her,

808
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:55,625
but she acted as if
we were even closer than before.

809
00:47:56,626 --> 00:47:59,504
I was quite puzzled by her reaction.

810
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:02,215
I flat out rejected her,
so she must've been shocked.

811
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:03,633
Why didn't she get angry--

812
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:07,470
Not everyone gets angry when they're
shocked or when their pride is hurt.

813
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:10,473
Unless she was going to cut ties with him,
getting angry at him--

814
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,518
I see.

815
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:16,646
PROSECUTION

816
00:48:16,729 --> 00:48:19,524
Another reason they think the video
wasn't recorded secretly?

817
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:23,528
I…

818
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:28,700
Because Jeon's statements
weren't consistent.

819
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:29,951
They weren't consistent?

820
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:31,035
WITNESS

821
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,164
Initially, she said it was because
she feared retaliation.

822
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:38,334
But then, she said it was because
she loved Ko.

823
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:41,754
The lack of consistency means
she wasn't raped and knew about the video?

824
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:43,298
I see.

825
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,008
Do you agree?

826
00:48:48,886 --> 00:48:50,763
Did you not do your assignment again?

827
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,141
I told you to read up on the precedents.

828
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:56,561
ONE HOUR AGO

829
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:58,104
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES

830
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,321
The Supreme Court
recently quashed the acquittal

831
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:09,157
of a sexual assault assailant,

832
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,576
granted due to the victim's
inconsistent statements.

833
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:13,244
Why was it quashed?

834
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:16,497
Because a little bit of inconsistency
does not mean

835
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,958
her arguments and their credibility
can be nullified.

836
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:23,171
And the victim's extraordinary
circumstances weren't considered--

837
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:26,549
Then what are Jeon's extraordinary
circumstances in this case?

838
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,097
-What are her extraordinary circumstances?
-The fact that…

839
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:39,062
she was raped by the man
she was engaged to and loved.

840
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:44,150
So intimate partner rape is different
from other types of sexual assault.

841
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:45,109
How's it different?

842
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:48,863
Open your eyes!

843
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:53,743
Tell me how it's different.

844
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:00,458
If it was a complete stranger,

845
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:04,962
I'd think of it as a terrible nightmare
and shake it off.

846
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:10,385
But it was my boyfriend, who was part
of the rosy future I had dreamed of.

JUROR

848
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,556
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT

849
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:28,486
After watching the video,
Jeon was shocked and started to panic.

850
00:50:29,153 --> 00:50:31,989
But she felt that she had to text him
"yeah" as usual,

851
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:33,491
because had she not replied,

852
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,745
he would've called her hundreds of times.
And he would've…

853
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:38,913

854
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:42,917

TEXT CONVERSATION

856
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:48,965
She was confused whether it was love,
or he was just abusing her.

857
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:50,883
JUROR

858
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,428
So she probably didn't even know
how to react to it.

859
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,311
<i>Ye-seul, how dare you?</i>

860
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:06,023
<i>You've become awfully arrogant</i>
<i>since getting into Hankuk Law.</i>

861
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,360
<i>Let go. Don't do this.</i>

862
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:11,779
How did you get this?

863
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,866
This angle is way better than
that of Ko Yeong-chang's dashcam.

864
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:16,742
He can't refute this.

865
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:18,786
He wanted to disseminate it,
not delete it.

866
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,621
How long have you had this?

867
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:22,665
Don't ask me
why I didn't share this sooner.

Professor, you were wrong.

870
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:35,738
I wanted to kill him.

871
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,907
When I found out about the video

872
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,077
and was threatened
that he'd disseminate it…

873
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:46,207
I wanted to hit that jerk with this
and pummel him to death.

JUROR

875
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:49,794
I was wrong indeed.

876
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,588
I didn't report it to the police because…

877
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:57,009
I couldn't even bear the thought
of telling someone about it.

878
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:02,598
I was

879
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:05,685
raped by the man I loved.

880
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,482
But you forced yourself to tell others.

PROSECUTION

886
00:53:20,491 --> 00:53:23,035
Because they'll be asked these questions.

00:53:24,453 --> 00:53:26,664
"You'll file charges
against your boyfriend?

Are you sure you were sexually assaulted?"

00:53:28,749 --> 00:53:31,711

-That is not allowed in my class.

PROSECUTION

899
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,156
While trying to protect herself
from the horrendous situation

900
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:44,784
of the sex video
being widely disseminated,

901
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:48,829
she unintentionally caused injury to Ko
by pushing him.

902
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:51,624
Based on the Criminal Code Article 21,

903
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:55,002
this was an act performed
to prevent unjust infringement.

904
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:57,755
ARTICLE 21 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE
- SELF-DEFENSE

905
00:54:57,838 --> 00:54:59,799
So I'd conclude she acted in self-defense.

I helped my uncle
when he was working on it.

920
00:56:01,485 --> 00:56:04,363
It can only be ruled self-defense

00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:07,366
performed in order to prevent impending

JUROR

924
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:21,505
If he punches me
after getting kicked in the shin,

925
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:24,759
it's considered mutual combat
and won't be ruled self-defense.

926
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:31,724
If he tries to defend himself
as I'm attacking him like this,

927
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,601
it'll be ruled self-defense.

928
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:35,311
Let's look at the screen.

929
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:42,610
Here. The phone fell on the ground.

930
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:45,780
Ye-seul kicked him after that,
wearing her high heels.

931
00:56:45,863 --> 00:56:47,490
Oh, you're right.

932
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,784
Ko dropped his phone, which means,

933
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:53,788
he couldn't disseminate it at the time,
so she should've stopped attacking him.

934
00:56:53,871 --> 00:56:54,789
No.

935
00:56:54,872 --> 00:56:57,875
She was panicking.
What if she didn't see him drop his phone?

936
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:01,295
-I mean, it was dark.
-Did you know he dropped his phone?

937
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:06,342
We'll consider
all extenuating circumstances.

938
00:57:07,176 --> 00:57:09,762
You knew about his phone,
but kicked him wearing the heels

939
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:11,597
because you were so angry, right?

940
00:57:14,725 --> 00:57:19,271
You kicked him knowing that his phone
had fallen on the ground, didn't you?

941
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:21,440
You said this earlier.

942
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:24,985
"I wanted to hit that jerk with this
and pummel him to death."

943
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,949
She should say no even if she knew.
That's what I'd do.

944
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,659
Ko is the bad guy here.

945
00:57:31,742 --> 00:57:33,160
I'd save myself.

946
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:36,497
You kicked him even though you knew
that his phone had fallen

947
00:57:37,456 --> 00:57:38,749
on the ground, right?

948
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:42,711
Yes.

949
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:49,718
For this to be ruled self-defense,

950
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:52,721
the defendant should've stopped
attacking him

951
00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:55,099
the moment Mr. Ko's phone
slipped out of his hand.

952
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:00,312
But as she admitted just now--

953
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:01,313
Are you blind?

954
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:02,731
Look at that.

955
00:58:02,815 --> 00:58:06,902
She did it because she was afraid
that jerk would pick up his phone.

But I probably would've done
exactly what Ye-seul did.

Out of fear that he'd pick up his phone.

I think that's what happened.

965

In other words,
the unjust infringement continued.

966
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:30,926
He didn't actually pick it up.

967
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:35,472
If he tried to pick it up, we cannot say
the unjust infringement continued.

968
00:58:43,606 --> 00:58:44,815
Say that again.

969
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:46,859
They proved his attempt to disseminate it.

970
00:58:46,942 --> 00:58:49,320
Depending on whether or not
it's ruled self-defense--

971
00:58:49,403 --> 00:58:52,114
Damn, that idiot Jin Hyeong-u!
What has he been doing?

972
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:55,242
-I even went there and put on a show--
-Shut up!

973
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,999
-Tell Prosecutor Jin
-Yes, sir.

974
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:03,959
to do whatever it takes

975
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:08,172
to get Juror no. 4 kicked out
before the jurors' discussion begins.

976
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:11,383
Thankfully, Juror no. 4
is an alternate juror.

977
00:59:14,595 --> 00:59:15,763
I see.

978
00:59:18,098 --> 00:59:21,227
I'll take a quick shower
and return before the discussion is over.

979
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,478
Okay.

980
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:26,565
I sent the photo to Choi after confirming
that he gave his statement.

981
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,067
He wrote an article right away.

982
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:29,777
Okay.

983
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,861
KO HYEONG-SU ATTACKED

984
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,571
ATTACKED BY LEE MAN-HO

985
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:41,247
Assemblyman Ko wants to get Lee Man-ho
locked up for attempted murder.

986
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,456
I'd appreciate that.

987
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:44,458
So I won't have to check this.

988
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:48,420
Give it to my roomie
you want to look out for.

989
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:52,549
What? Are you disappointed
that it's not you?

990
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:56,637
Well, that makes me want
to look out for you, too.

991
01:00:05,354 --> 01:00:06,647
Byeol is home alone.

992
01:00:08,148 --> 01:00:10,693
Right, alternate jurors also have to stay
until the end.

993
01:00:10,776 --> 01:00:12,611
MILL

994
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,488
Hold on.

995
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:22,454
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

996
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:34,800
You somehow managed to win
Reporter Choi over.

997
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:41,181
You think you can use this
to bring me to trial?

998
01:00:41,265 --> 01:00:42,266
You will be indicted.

999
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:45,602
You want to clear your father's name
by making me a defendant?

1000
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:49,398
I told you to stop messing with me.
You just can't take hints.

1001
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:53,027
Why do you think I sat in on this trial?

1002
01:01:04,663 --> 01:01:06,874
What you see isn't everything.

1003
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,878
But then again, how would you know
the substantial truth

1004
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:13,172
that even your father didn't know
until he died?

1005
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:23,307
You need to learn about it
if you want to work in law.

1006
01:01:25,934 --> 01:01:26,935
Am I wrong?

1007
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:40,991
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

1008
01:01:41,075 --> 01:01:43,118
Did you read the article about Lee Man-ho?

1009
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,496
Where is he now?

1010
01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:48,415
He hasn't stepped out of his house
since the article came out.

1011
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:50,000
EUNPYEONG-GU

1012
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:51,502
LEE MAN-HO

1013
01:01:53,962 --> 01:01:56,715
Please call me
if you notice anything unusual.

1014
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:14,441
KO HYEONG-SU ATTACKED

1015
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:26,620
I gave you my blood to save your life.

1016
01:02:26,703 --> 01:02:29,248
You can't do this to me.

1017
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:51,062

<i>The real culprit is caught.</i>

1019
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:10,164
As if it was not enough to dig up
Ko's back. You didn't bribe them, did you?

1020
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:12,332
<i>It won't be acknowledged as self-defense.</i>

1021
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,127
<i>It means Lee Man-ho is the real culprit.</i>

1022
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,629
<i>Tell that jerk Choi</i>
<i>to walk back his remarks</i>

1023
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:20,424
and make it
look like you caught the culprit.

1024
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:22,676
I don't think I can work for you anymore.

1025
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,053
Did you really kill Seo Byung-ju?

1026
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:26,847
<i>But Lee Man-ho…</i>
