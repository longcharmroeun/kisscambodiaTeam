MY VIEW ON KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARISM

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,233
BY PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

5
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,618
Bring me the laptop.

6
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,010
You think I can't find you, right?

7
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,931
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

8
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:26,706
I thought I made it clear.

9
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:30,252
You aren't allowed
to use a laptop in my class.

10
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,336
Professor.

11
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,422
A student's right
to use a laptop in class is

12
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,174
a matter of self-determination

13
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:37,968
as guaranteed by the Constitution.

14
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,135
And?

15
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:42,472
I don't want Article 10,
the right to pursue happiness, infringed

16
00:01:43,056 --> 00:01:44,766
during the Constitution lecture.

17
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,767
Don't you think

18
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:49,896
what you just said infringes
my right to hold classes as the professor?

19
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:51,773
This is my court,

20
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:54,693
and I have a right to teach however I like
when I'm in my turf.

21
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,446
Don't you think you're abusing your right?

22
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,782
It's your dereliction of duty
as a student!

23
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,993
I'll have points deducted.

24
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,833
Do you believe others
didn't bring their laptops

25
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,251
just because of their grades?

26
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,295
I don't know what others are thinking.

27
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,256
I weighed the pros and cons
of using a laptop during this class,

28
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:18,633
and decided having it here
benefits me more.

29
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:20,218
Then was this on your list?

30
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,556
The fatal fact that you will be remembered
as the worst student

31
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,849
I ever had in my career.

32
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:41,323
Yes, Professor Kang.

33
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:44,534
Did you tell Kang Sol B to pick up
her laptop at my office?

34
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:46,411
She hasn't come for it yet?

35
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:48,038
I clearly remember telling her.

37
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,752
Professor?

38
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,588
Are you sure this laptop
is Kang Sol B's laptop?

39
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,840
Yes, I almost had to take it from her
by force.

MY VIEW ON KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARISM

49

BY YANG JONG-HOON

50
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:30,705
I found this while preparing a paper
on publicizing criminal charges.

51
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,791
The student in question is

52
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,043
Kang Sol B, a freshman at our school.

53
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:38,129
This is practically a translated copy

54
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:39,422
of a paper you wrote

55
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:41,841
for Law Review
while you were studying at Harvard.

56
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,388
KANG SOL

57
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:49,140
I'll meet Kang Sol B first to check

58
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:51,685
-the facts of the matter--
-No.

59
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,188
I'll see her first.

60
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,112
Bring me the laptop.

61
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,667
You think I can't find you, right?

FROM YANG JONG-HOON

63
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:21,631
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,680
What brings you here at this hour?

65
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,640
Please take a seat.

66
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:37,022
If it's about the dismissal--

67
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:40,608
I can't resolve that by visiting you.
I'm visiting the president tomorrow.

68
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:42,360
Then what brings you here?

69
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:45,780
The biggest reason for my arrest
was destruction of evidence

70
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,449
because my laptop went missing.

71
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:48,825
I've heard.

72
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:50,827
At first, I thought I had lost it,

73
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,163
then remembered
keeping it in my office that day.

74
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,166
Why are you telling me this?

75
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:58,418
Someone could've stolen it.

76
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,420
I'm having a reasonable doubt.

77
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:03,715
Someone stole it?
Why would anyone steal your laptop?

78
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:05,508
What do you think?

79
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:08,970
It was a new laptop, so it only had
references for the plagiarism.

80
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:11,931
There were no leads or evidence
that'd point to the culprit.

81
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:14,017
There was no reason for me to hide that.

82
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,980
References for the plagiarism?

83
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:20,648
I bet you saw that too.

84
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:23,568
My view on the plagiarism
of Kang Sol B's research paper.

85
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:25,987
Why do you have 12?

86
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:30,200
If you had some until this morning,
you should have six left.

87
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:37,207
You haven't taken this for three days!

88
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,086
That's why you missed the comma.

89
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:48,927
Take it.

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,806
It wouldn't have happened
if you lived at home.

91
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:16,704
Hey, what are you doing?

92
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:23,670
LAW SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

93
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:29,509
Happy now?

94
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,511
I'm staying here.

95
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:43,982
We need some privacy.

96
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:45,817
What?

97
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,490
She has the same name?

98
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:56,035
I never liked how you had to share a room
with that girl.

99
00:06:56,995 --> 00:07:00,373
B? Why should my daughter be the B?

100
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,208
This is so annoying.

101
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:05,628
Are you saying Kang Sol B

102
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:09,549
took your laptop
because of your opinion on her plagiarism?

103
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,636
The content is also in my head,
so that can't be the only reason.

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,140
In that case,
do you think the reason she took it has

105
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,560
a connection to Professor Seo's death?

106
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:25,732
I'm staying here.

107
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,944
-You're going to stay here?
-Yes.

108
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:38,161
Again?

109
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:41,414
Your dad's the last one
who gets to defy me.

110
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,044
Spit it out.

111
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,839
I'll go with you, so spit it out.

112
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,807
She missed the comma
for not taking her medicine?

113
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:04,270
Whoa, hey. Are you okay?

114
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:05,855
I'm fine.

115
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,358
Whoa.

116
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,242
Ye-seul.

117
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,743
Sol, I'm fine.

118
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:20,912
I think I had too much to drink.

119
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,915
I'll go to sleep.

120
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:24,916
Okay.

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,920
Are you sure you're okay?

122
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:31,547
Have you met with Kang Sol B?

123
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,549
Not yet.

124
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,804
I waited for Professor Seo
to meet her first before I dealt with her.

125
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,516
The president is already deeply concerned
that a murder case broke out

126
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,059
at our law school.

127
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:45,186
If the controversy
over plagiarism breaks out…

128
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,647
Covering it up may be an option.

129
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,940
That's not what I meant.

130
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,192
Once we restore the school's reputation--

131
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:53,778
Please do your best
to restore our ruined reputation.

132
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:54,696
Professor Yang.

133
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,447
I'll manage the plagiarism case.

134
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,367
Professor Yang!

135
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,708
I knew I shouldn't have
let you join a study group.

136
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,085
Those good-for-nothing study mates

137
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:10,545
made your grades drop too.

138
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:15,633
How on earth can your grades
be that low for the Criminal Code?

139
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,010
And the Constitution too.

140
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:20,054
Did you have to get points deducted
over a laptop?

141
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,390
At least you still got an A plus.

142
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:26,394
It doesn't matter anyway
because of my paper.

143
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:28,187
No one will turn that into a problem.

144
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:32,150
Only victims can complain about copyright,
and Seo Byung-ju is dead.

145
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:33,818
Yang Jong-hoon.

146
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:36,154
Professor Yang knows.

147
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,656
No one would believe a murderer.

148
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:40,533
Don't get weird ideas and--

149
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,576
The sugar packet.

150
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,745
It was on the table as he stated.

151
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:46,414
So what?

152
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,631
It wasn't Professor Yang who…

153
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,390
Tell me.

154
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,934
If it wasn't him, who was it?

155
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:16,486
METH LETHAL DOSE

156
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,158
Why won't he pick up his phone?

157
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,344
Hello?

158
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:47,058
Your daughter saw the sugar packet.

159
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,020
Why did she lie to the police?

160
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:53,272
That's not all.

161
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,607
I looked at her phone too.

162
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,401
"Meth lethal dose, where to get meth,
how long does it take

163
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,445
for a person to die after meth intake?"

164
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,198
Why did she search for these?

165
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,075
Could it be her?

166
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:05,952
No, right?

167
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:09,205
It's not about her
stopping to go to the psychiatrist.

168
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,542
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

169
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,296
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

170
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:35,481
Kang Sol.

171
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,984
Your laptop is in the professor's office.

172
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,902
-Why?
-It was his order.

173
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:41,028
You're to pick it up.

174
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,906
So why did you insist on having
the laptop--

175
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:51,622
KANG JU-MAN, IN A MEETING

176
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:33,581
Yang Jong-hoon's laptop
wasn't in Han Joon-hwi's locker or room.

177
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,001
He said the one who took
the laptop is the culprit?

178
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:04,862
Let's go study.

179
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:25,716
Dry my hair.

180
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,218
You can use that as an apology.

181
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,807
I had reasons to doubt.

182
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:34,642
You did feel sorry.

183
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,520
Then just say you're sorry.

184
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:40,731
-That's too hot!
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

185
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:42,191
It was cold wind.

186
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:45,611
That was easy, right?

187
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,242
Anyway, about the sugar packet
Prof. Yang mentioned.

188
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:52,785
You didn't see it on the scene?

189
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,912
No. Why?

190
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,291
If someone can testify
that the sugar packet was there,

191
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,668
it'd help him greatly.

192
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,278
I got my own problems,
but this case looks frustrating too.

193
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:28,237
I'M IN A LIBEL SUIT

194
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,490
-How did you know?
-My gosh.

195
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:33,367
Why couldn't you be here sooner?

196
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:37,038
Go join the police
if you can spot autopsy fabrication.

197
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,955
That?

198
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,790
I took a completely wild guess,

199
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,083
so I just got lucky.

200
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:44,086
That Gollum with connections
did all the big work.

201
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:46,297
What about your aunt?

202
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:48,966
She should be punished for her crime.

203
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:51,886
What are you up to?

204
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:54,472
"Bad FaMa"?

205
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:57,016
Yes, a website that exposes parents
who refuse to give

206
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,726
child support after their divorce.

207
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:02,355
The website operator got sued for libel.

208
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,651
So what's with this familiar face?

209
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,986
You know my situation.

210
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,489
I have too many papers due
and too much to study.

211
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,240
Yet Kang Sol's passionate heart

212
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:15,451
refuses to turn down
this frustrating case?

213
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,037
Why didn't you just study

214
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,955
instead of joining the Legal Clinic?

215
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:23,000
I can see everything.

216
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,381
If I help, let's call it even
for you helping me.

217
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:29,674
Even, my foot.

218
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,760
You need to prove
Professor Yang's innocence.

219
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:37,098
What's this?

220
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,015
MY ROOMMATE HAS LEFT

221
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,684
She's dropping our study group?

222
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,019
Dropping? Who's dropping what?

223
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:44,563
I thought you came back.

224
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,148
Welcome back.

225
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:48,901
I'm sorry to make you worried.

226
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:52,321
What time are we visiting them tomorrow?

227
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,781
-At four o'clock.
-Okay.

228
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:56,117
Did you look through the website?

229
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,076
I did.

230
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,077
Can you print that?

231
00:15:58,703 --> 00:15:59,620
Okay.

232
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:08,671
Just do as I say.

233
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:14,927
We stopped seeing the psychiatrist,

234
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,054
but we've done well.

235
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:20,224
If you really think so,
let me stay in the dorm.

236
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:23,686
No.

237
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,480
Drop the study group, get a tutor.

238
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,318
You know the first-year grades
are very important to be a law clerk.

239
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:34,905
Stay focused on your study.

240
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,074
Do you understand?

241
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,162
Don't worry and just do as I say, then--

242
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:42,455
Speak for yourself.

243
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,299
Sol.

244
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:58,679
Is this why
you didn't let us read your paper?

245
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,318
I've been meaning to come and see you,

246
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,195
and I happened to take your call.

247
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,280
Vice Dean Kang said

248
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,033
you met the dean
over your daughter's grades.

249
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,661
I went to see her as a parent
of a student at Hankuk Law School

250
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:24,705
over the nonsense of how they let someone

251
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,626
who got arrested for murder charges
write the midterm test questions.

252
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:33,631
On top of that, you're indicted
and removed from your office.

253
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:35,716
I was removed
as an administrative measure.

254
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,301
It's as good as a punishment.

255
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:40,262
If you'll be tried for murder charges,
doesn't it disqualify you

256
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,723
as a professor at a law school?

257
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,559
Before you say that,
let's discuss your daughter's paper.

258
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,813
It wasn't just plagiarism,
but copyright infringement.

259
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,565
Since her grand prize
played a part in her admission,

260
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:53,400
so it could be revoked too.

261
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,986
Remember?
I was fluent in English by middle school,

262
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,822
getting full marks in TOEFL and TEPS.

263
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:02,034
As you can see, she also participated
in global mock trials, mock UN committee,

264
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,912
and was awarded
in various debate competitions.

265
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,790
Weren't you jealous
when I won the Best Reporter Award

266
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:09,416
at the Constitutional Court

267
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,794
over high school and university students?

268
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,171
But this paper, in middle school?

269
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:16,173
Sol helped him write that paper,

270
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:17,466
but he only listed

271
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,177
his name on the byline
when he turned it into Harvard Law.

272
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,555
Are you saying
Prof. Seo took advantage of her?

273
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:24,598
He said he can't finish that dissertation,

274
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:25,933
so we thought that was it.

275
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:28,853
We didn't know he published the paper
without her knowledge.

276
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,897
He completely disregarded
that middle school girl.

277
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,067
So your daughter had no idea
he published the paper?

278
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,778
I just wrote my paper
with the material I researched.

279
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:40,656
-And she submitted it in the contest.
-In conclusion,

280
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,324
this is a middle schooler's paper?

281
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:43,993
All of her father's side is in law.

282
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:46,203
Her home was filled with law books.

283
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:48,205
She played with those since kindergarten,

284
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,166
and knew the Constitution
better than the National Anthem.

285
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,627
She's capable of doing this
with her born legal mind.

286
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:55,671
That's for me to decide as a professor.

287
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,089
I don't care if you buy it.

288
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:01,385
You must be disappointed.

289
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,554
You wanted me gone like Joon-hwi.

290
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:05,431
No way.

291
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,017
He was so happy
that he even dried my hair.

292
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:10,561
I'm glad, then.

293
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:13,188
You wrote a paper in middle school?

294
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,611
With what you can do, I believe that.

295
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,699
I apologize for how my uncle
treated you with disdain.

296
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,168
Fabricating the cause of death?

297
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,920
I thought it happened only on TV.

298
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:38,839
I knew you didn't do it.

299
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,008
You even announced
how suspicious Joon-hwi was.

300
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,343
That's because…

301
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,348
my grades were already very awful,

302
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:49,808
so I couldn't risk
getting on Yangcrates' bad side.

303
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,398
How much do you want
to forget how I offended you?

304
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,776
I'll pay up over 24 months!

305
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,914
I wanted your side of the story.

306
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:16,001
Prof. Seo prepared his paper with you

307
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:19,046
while you were in middle school,
then published it as his own?

308
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:21,924
Yes.

309
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,468
If I had known he published that paper,

310
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:27,054
I wouldn't have turned it in
for the contest.

311
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,057
I heard you'd met with Prof. Seo.

312
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,477
KANG SOL

313
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:37,690
KANG SOL

314
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:43,404
Come in.

315
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:52,830
Take a seat.

316
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:03,674
With my mom.

317
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,012
She was very angry

318
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,640
that my paper was mistaken as plagiarized.

319
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,020
According to your mother,

320
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:18,564
Prof. Seo apologized to you, right?

321
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:26,447
Is it me this time?

322
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,283
So what if he doesn't believe it?

323
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:32,911
We told him that's our case.

324
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,166
How is he going to cross-check this
with a dead man?

325
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,627
Enough is enough!

326
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:42,671
Your daughter and I are perfectly sane.

327
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:43,881
It's all your fault!

328
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:52,765
I had a question.

329
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:11,742
Dad.

330
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:24,630
If only you passed the judicial exam
and became a judge.

331
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:36,141
You were with me at the time

332
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:38,519
when Prof. Seo was murdered?

333
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:40,979
Do you think the reason she took it has

334
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:43,065
a connection to Professor Seo's death?

335
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,155
No, it wasn't her. She was with me
when the case broke out.

336
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,406
She was with you?

337
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,076
She insisted on using her laptop in class,

338
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:56,537
so I called her and had a talk with her.

339
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,996
You weren't.

340
00:22:58,497 --> 00:23:00,249
You didn't say that to the police.

341
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:11,343
Then why

342
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:13,595
didn't you say anything?

343
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:15,806
You said you saw this.

344
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,233
What about you?

345
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,111
Why didn't you say anything?

346
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:34,283
I have a sweet tooth.

347
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:35,576
You needed Prof. Yang

348
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,911
-to become the suspect--
-Enough.

349
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:43,208
We'll talk at home.

350
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,963
What if Prof. Yang sees this?

351
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,716
Don't bring this to school.

352
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:53,135
Make his suspicion solid.

353
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:58,765
Did you get rid of his laptop?

354
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,073
Are you okay?

355
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:18,535
How can I be okay?
I can't even give a lecture.

356
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:20,662
Should I nitpick over this
with the president?

357
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:25,208
This one is a criminal case.

358
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:29,296
Since I gave birth, it's too much
to be the chief of the Legal Clinic.

359
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,509
Hey, what's this? "Kang Sol B"?

360
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:36,553
My goodness.

361
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:39,264
I knew she was smart,
but she's this smart?

362
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:43,769
My gosh, in middle school?
Gosh, my son is nothing compared to her.

363
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:45,312
I'll take this case.

364
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:47,481
You should manage your own problem first.

365
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:49,107
What about the president?

366
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:51,401
She wrote that herself,
so compare those two.

367
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:55,447
Prof. Seo's paper.

368
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,490
What?

369
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:58,325
What is this?

370
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:05,374
HAN JOON-HWI

371
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:06,792
HAN JOON-HWI INVITED KANG SOL

372
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:09,503
SETTINGS

373
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:10,462
EXIT

374
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:12,047
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO EXIT?

375
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,098
HAN JOON-HWI

376
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:25,477
So you're leaving us?

377
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:28,689
-What will you do instead?
-Get a tutor.

378
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:46,164
When you search
for Hankuk University on the Internet,

379
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:49,626
all you get is "the Law School murderer."

380
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,212
Hankuk University
is now equal to a murderer!

381
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,297
In the National Assembly,

382
00:25:55,048 --> 00:25:57,467
our alumni are hanging our heads in shame!

383
00:25:57,551 --> 00:26:00,929
We already put him off duty,
so we'll punish him later--

384
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,473
Later, my ass. Dismiss him this instant!

385
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:05,851
A professor of a law school

386
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:07,853
is involved in a crime
none other than murder.

387
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,021
He murdered him!

388
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:11,773
He hasn't been tried,
so his charges aren't confirmed.

389
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:13,775
So you're going to sit here

390
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:15,444
and take the shame until then?

391
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,238
People are
only presumed innocent on paper.

392
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:20,490
Don't you know everyone
is presumed as guilty?

393
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,784
The fact that he's indicted
means he's guilty!

394
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,872
Before the alumni
stop donating to the school--

395
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:30,333
President, Prof. Yang Jong-hoon
of the Law School wishes to see you.

396
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,544
I'll call him.

397
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,256
Don't let him resign.

398
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:37,674
He should be fired

399
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:41,470
so that he can't show up here ever again.

400
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:03,617
The Law School murderer.

401
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:05,952
How arrogant.

402
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:09,289
You won't even greet me.

403
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,711
Did you want to be greeted by the murderer
of your closest friend?

404
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,671
You're right.

405
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:22,135
I never got to say one last goodbye
to my closest friend.

406
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:28,266
You may have avoided detention
even though you murdered somebody,

407
00:27:28,892 --> 00:27:31,978
but you better not dream
of sticking around at the Law School.

408
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:34,106
I will

409
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:37,609
make sure I cut your throat.

410
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,738
If that's why you came,
you came here in vain.

411
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:44,407
I'll accept my removal
according to our rules,

412
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:45,909
but nothing more than that.

413
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,411
I'll do whatever it takes
within the scope of law

414
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:50,288
to fight and struggle.

415
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,623
What?

416
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:56,837
I get how you've gone crazy.

417
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:58,672
You've been indicted.

418
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:00,841
Assemblyman Ko.

419
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,677
When your close friend
indicted you for bribery,

420
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,595
you asserted very confidently

421
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,974
indictment doesn't equal guilt,
that you won't be caught in this frame.

422
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,060
It made me almost gag.

423
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:16,940
How long will you continue to be so sassy?

424
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:19,317
We'll see about that.

425
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:21,445
On the day he died,

426
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,906
why do you think
I tried to get on a flight?

427
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:30,662
I've been looking for Kang Dan.
I'll leave you at that.

428
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:44,050
What? Professor Yang?

429
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,012
Yes, okay.

430
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:54,436
BAD FAMA

431
00:28:57,564 --> 00:28:59,483
What did your kids do to deserve this?

432
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,861
Their real names, occupations,
and photos of their faces.

433
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:04,571
That's too much personal info.

434
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,406
Are you worried about these people?

435
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,741
I'm worried about you.

436
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:09,326
You got papers and studies to do.

437
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:12,746
Stop talking to me.
I have to be Prof. Yang's assistant.

438
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:15,290
Prof. Kim said
he's coming in for the consultation--

439
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,417
-I'm doing this.
-What?

440
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,127
Prof. Yang asked me for help.

441
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:21,463
Be a good assistant.

442
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:29,304
How can the defendant
summon the prosecutor in charge?

443
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,350
After you're indicted, you'll be in court.

444
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,435
We didn't have to take this to court,

445
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,771
so you needed a chance
to drop the indictment.

446
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:41,775
First, release you, then drop this?

447
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,862
You're telling me to lose my face and job.

448
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:47,197
Go ahead.

449
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:51,243
There's nothing more dangerous
as wasting time as a prosecutor.

450
00:29:57,332 --> 00:30:00,293
"A prosecutor who wastes time
brings shame to that scale."

451
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:03,505
You remembered that?

452
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:05,632
The dead victim used to say that often.

453
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:08,426
And also something
you should've remembered, Prosecutor Jin.

454
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,846
I see. I'm guessing that you remembered.

455
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:16,393
It turns out
that Prosecutor Seo wasted his time,

456
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:20,522
so I can see why you got mad
with a sense of betrayal.

457
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:26,903
I need to go put all of my efforts
into keeping this indictment going.

458
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:29,823
See you in court.

459
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:33,577
Right.

460
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:36,663
After you quit your job as a prosecutor,

461
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,374
Prosecutor Seo got completely wasted
and said this.

462
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:44,129
"If I end up dying,

463
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:47,549
I'll die in the hands
of Yang Jong-hoon, that jerk."

464
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,065
His children were
about to starve to death,

465
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:05,483
but he threw a feast

466
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:09,696
at a hotel restaurant on his birthday,
costing at least 100,000 won per person,

467
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,449
and got a luxury-brand bag
for his mistress.

468
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:15,869
Eight out of ten people
never receive child support.

469
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:19,956
I believe Child Support Agency exists
under the MOGEF.

470
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,708
Even with the request,

471
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:25,086
it takes a year and a half to two years
until a decision is made.

472
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:28,632
The livelihood is breaking down,

473
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:29,924
and the child…

474
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,554
Even when the court orders them
to pay the support,

475
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:36,181
many of them don't do it.

476
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,392
If they don't,
the worst punishment is detention.

477
00:31:39,476 --> 00:31:41,728
But if they use a false address
or go off the grid

478
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,563
for six months, they get off.

479
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:47,901
And there are numbers of them
who'd rather be detained than pay up.

480
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:50,779
So did you want to punish them personally?

481
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:54,199
By putting them to shame?

482
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:57,410
That's not it.

483
00:31:57,494 --> 00:32:00,497
The purpose of this website is
to shame them and make them pay.

484
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:01,956
Isn't that it?

485
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:09,673
Anyone with a child
would understand how I feel.

486
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:11,299
Even so, nothing will change.

487
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:14,386
All these people's information got out
because they had kids.

488
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:19,683
You came here as a defendant,
not a victim.

489
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:21,851
Joon-hwi.

490
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:25,689
I shouldn't have come.

491
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:30,068
Wait. You can't leave like this.

492
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:31,778
I grew up with a single mother,

493
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,363
so I understand how you feel.

494
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:37,075
Thank you.

495
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:39,994
I…

496
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:45,333
Don't you think you're too harsh?

497
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,876
She's a defendant?

498
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,795
She was a victim before she got accused!

499
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:50,380
She's in question for libel.

500
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:52,966
And she got sued over that,
so she is the defendant.

501
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:54,509
Professor, she was desperate--

502
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,761
You're giving legal,
not psychological advice.

503
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:58,847
Instead of getting emotional
and worked up,

504
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,640
you're to provide a solution calmly.

505
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:04,477
Present how you'll counter this.

506
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:06,688
Me?

507
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:10,442
You made him innocent
after he was sued for defamation.

508
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,530
Good luck.

509
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:23,121
Professor.

510
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:25,331
This is ripped up,

511
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:27,834
but is this the same sugar packet
from the crime?

512
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:38,386
CODE OF LAW, CRIMINAL CODE,
HANDS-ON CIVIL CASES

513
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:57,572
J2008B4 DECISION

514
00:33:58,448 --> 00:33:59,491
J2008B4 DECISION

515
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,664
LEGAL ARTICLES: CHILD SUPPORT

516
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,500
IF CHILD SUPPORT IS 12 MONTHS OVERDUE…

517
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:29,604
Do you understand this concept?

518
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:32,690
Let's take a look at this explanation.

519
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:35,443
For example, even if
the debtor owes 10 million won,

520
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:37,487
if the trustee is insolvent,

521
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,782
if they have zero funds,
the actual value can be zero won.

522
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:41,866
In that case…

523
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:44,494
HAN JOON-HWI: YOU'LL REALLY GET A TUTOR?

524
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:50,416
MOM: DINNER IS READY

525
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,931
YOU HAVE 2 FINGERPRINT IDS

526
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,434
What is this?

527
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,312
Just a mom looking at her girl's phone.

528
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:13,523
What? Are you hiding something?

529
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:20,405
-What is this?
-I can't stay home.

530
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:24,534
Go to your room.

531
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:27,912
-Your tutor will be here.
-I can't stay here.

532
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,625
Is it that jerk, Han Joon-hwi?

533
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:39,173
You have no time to fool around
with jerks like him.

534
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:45,513
Go back to your room.

535
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:48,600
I went through much trouble
trying to get this tutor

536
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:51,394
who never does one-on-one lessons--

537
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:52,687
I don't need a tutor.

538
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:55,106
I wrote a paper in middle school.

539
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:58,735
What?

540
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:01,863
-You--
-I'm that good.

541
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:03,698
So why do I need help?

542
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:05,283
What's with you?

543
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:07,410
Is something wrong with you?

544
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:10,246
Go ahead and leave

545
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,206
if you can.

546
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:57,001
Don't spit it out.

547
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:04,425
Swallow it.

548
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,680
Gulp it down.

549
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:10,848
Swallow it.

550
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:18,606
You can't even swallow that.

551
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:22,568
Enough is enough.

552
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:25,655
Mom.

553
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,327
Whoever dies,

554
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,122
I'm not scared of that.

555
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:46,884
I'm going back to my dorm.

556
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:17,749
The law is there, but it's useless.

557
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:20,043
If someone doesn't want
to pay child support,

558
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,711
there are loopholes everywhere.

559
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,839
Gosh, this darned rhinitis.

560
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,428
Hey, Joon-hwi.
Go back to your room and sleep.

561
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:34,390
Whoa.

562
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:36,976
Why?

563
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,979
I mean, think of how the children are
suffering from this.

564
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:43,608
Children are the victims
of unpaid child supports.

565
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:49,363
Darn it. We should give them
criminal punishment like other countries.

566
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:53,951
It was for the public's good
to protect children's survival.

567
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:57,038
I need to make this argument
and have it accepted.

568
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:59,791
This is justified
since it's in the public interest?

569
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,125
That's your specialty.

570
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,795
But this one won't be easy.

571
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,923
Unlike Lee Man-ho's time,
it was done on a website run by a mother

572
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:09,717
who got no child support,
not a governmental institution.

573
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:12,804
Exactly. She didn't just expose
her ex-husband's information.

574
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:15,973
She had a verifying process
through checking decisions

575
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:17,183
to upload other people--

576
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,852
That means creditors can make a website

577
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:21,938
and upload information of their debtors?

578
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:23,481
-That's not right.
-Why not?

579
00:39:24,357 --> 00:39:26,484
Both cases want to shame people for money.

580
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:28,903
Fine. I get that you're a big shot.

581
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:32,073
This is my limit.

582
00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:37,203
Hey, if we don't make her innocent,

583
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:40,331
those shameless parents
who refuse to pay child support will

584
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,792
get confident
and feel justified for their actions.

585
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,628
Then what about the kids?
Their lives will be tormented.

586
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:48,047
I can't let that happen.

587
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:50,716
Should the big shot help?

588
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,176
You said it's my specialty.

589
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:08,192
That day,

590
00:40:10,236 --> 00:40:13,364
I wanted Professor Seo
to disappear from before my eyes.

591
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,288
Hye-gyeong, your daughter…

592
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:22,290
I left you for that man,

593
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:26,002
yet he failed the judicial exam
and gave up,

594
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:30,047
and he became the ugly duckling
in his family of judges.

595
00:40:30,715 --> 00:40:31,632
So I decided

596
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:37,054
to lay my life down
to turn her into a judge.

597
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:41,392
I told her to copy your paper.

598
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:43,811
-Hye-gyeong.
-Don't make an issue.

599
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,272
If you do, her life

600
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,816
and my life will both end.

601
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:52,945
You don't

602
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:57,783
want me to die and disappear, do you?

603
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:01,829
Does your husband know?

604
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:06,000
How did you end up like this?

605
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:10,046
It's all my fault.

606
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:14,634
If I turned out
the way she wanted me to be,

607
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:18,554
she wouldn't have been
this obsessed with you.

608
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:21,015
The milk is split.

609
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,310
We can't put it back,

610
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:26,437
but we can wipe it away.

611
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:33,653
Nothing happened to us.

612
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:37,865
Did you lose the laptop?

613
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,785
What will you do with your made-up alibi?

614
00:41:41,577 --> 00:41:43,496
Prof. Yang will see the police record.

615
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,209
Let's not do this.

616
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:51,921
-Let's turn--
-No, not that.

617
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:54,715
-I don't want my life to end here.
-Sol.

618
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,259
You said it was your fault.

619
00:41:58,052 --> 00:41:59,512
Then just do as I say.

620
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,098
Nothing happened to us.

621
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:11,482
I'll get a taxi.

622
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:28,749
Do you think I left Byung-ju

623
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,627
just to put up a photo like this
in my living room?

624
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,631
Will one of us have to die
before you stop saying that?

625
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:44,015
The public interest.

626
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,893
How am I going to prove
she did it in the public interest?

627
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,983
Hey, are you back?

628
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:57,695
I'm glad you're back.

629
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,238
It was too empty without you.

630
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,828
Are you coming back
to the study group too?

631
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:41,614
It's the same kind.

632
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:43,449
Where did you find it?

633
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:13,687
I found a single-serve sugar packet here,

634
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:15,064
not an ordinary packaging.

635
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:18,901
At first, the sugar packet
was found on the floor.

636
00:44:20,486 --> 00:44:21,403
After he used it,

637
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:25,825
the packaging was left on the table.

638
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:38,546
That sugar packet.

639
00:44:39,797 --> 00:44:42,508
Who dropped it and why?

640
00:44:44,343 --> 00:44:45,553
COLOR PRINTER: 100 WON

641
00:44:52,977 --> 00:44:55,312
Gollum will kill us if he catches us.

642
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:56,564
He won't do it if we ask.

643
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:58,315
And why are you such a coward?

644
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:00,693
We can just copy, pay up, and leave.

645
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:11,871
-My gosh.
-What was that?

646
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:15,082
Future prosecutors and judges.

647
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,169
You're in an empty store all alone
making copies

648
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:20,629
of someone's copyrighted work to study?

649
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:22,756
I won't let that happen.

650
00:45:23,716 --> 00:45:26,218
-Get lost!
-Everyone else does this anyway.

651
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:28,053
Why are you the only one who won't?

652
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:29,930
I can't do it. Do you see this?

653
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:31,473
It's illegal to copy books.

654
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:33,475
But our textbooks are too expensive.

655
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:36,770
Please save the poor law students
and let us copy these.

656
00:45:36,854 --> 00:45:38,647
No matter how expensive it is,

657
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:41,901
you violated the Copyright Act
of a Copyright Law textbook.

658
00:45:41,984 --> 00:45:43,611
Must I let go of this irony?

659
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:46,197
It's not our main textbook,
and we just need an excerpt.

660
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,324
Paying 50,000 won for that is
like tyranny.

661
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,075
Am I the tyrant here?

662
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,244
If you want a portion,
just copy that part.

663
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:55,289
They don't tell us what that portion is
to make us buy the book.

664
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:56,874
What?

665
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,627
That's just completely unfair.

666
00:46:01,587 --> 00:46:02,963
Go complain to your professor.

667
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:04,924
-Go complain to them!
-My gosh!

668
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:07,301
-Okay? Go complain to them!
-Move, move!

669
00:46:07,384 --> 00:46:09,511
-Go! Go away! Go!
-What's going on--

670
00:46:13,265 --> 00:46:14,558
Do you have a death wish?

671
00:46:15,643 --> 00:46:19,730
Jung Dae-hyeon, that jerk.
Wasn't taking Yangcrates' class enough?

672
00:46:19,855 --> 00:46:22,691
He pulled a cheap trick
to make them buy his wife's book.

673
00:46:22,775 --> 00:46:24,235
NO ILLEGAL COPYING ALLOWED!

674
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,695
He shouldn't take advantage of them.

675
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:29,031
He could just make copies
to use in his class.

676
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:34,495
Hand it back.

677
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:39,041
I heard you'll be studying
the Copyright Act in Criminal Code.

678
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:40,209
-Yes.
-Okay.

679
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,545
Compensation is an important aspect
of copyright suits,

680
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:45,464
so we'll take a look at it too.

681
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:48,968
And Prof. Jung will do his class
only on that portion,

682
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:50,678
so you won't have to buy a book.

683
00:46:52,304 --> 00:46:54,098
-All right!
-I knew it, Prof. Kim.

684
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,474
She took one for the team.

685
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:59,019
She truly loves her students.
Professor Kim! I love you deeply.

686
00:46:59,103 --> 00:47:00,813
-I love you!
-I love you!

687
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:02,273
-I love you!
-I love you!

688
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:05,567
Why don't you show some true love
for the Civil Code too?

689
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,653
Why are your grades the lowest

690
00:47:07,736 --> 00:47:10,114
for the Civil Code
despite my awesome lectures?

691
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,156
It kills my pride.

692
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,366
-It's hard.
-It's tough.

693
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,994
It's not fun if it's too easy.

694
00:47:15,077 --> 00:47:17,538
The best law firms
will look at your Civil Code grades

695
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:19,498
before they hire you, so what now?

696
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:23,002
Now, let's make sure we do this right! Go!

697
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:24,795
-Okay!
-Yes, ma'am.

698
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:27,506
What do you think of
when you hear copyright infringement?

699
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:28,465
Plagiarism.

700
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,717
Paper plagiarism.

701
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,386
Paper plagiarism. That's a hot potato.

702
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:36,974
Let's say I plagiarized the paper
of Kang Sol B, who's sitting here.

703
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:38,183
Is that an infringement?

704
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:40,227
If it's plagiarized, it is, right?

705
00:47:40,311 --> 00:47:42,229
Plagiarism doesn't equal infringement.

706
00:47:42,313 --> 00:47:43,814
A valid copyright infringement

707
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:46,984
must include grounds
that are both subjective and objective.

708
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:49,278
Plagiarism is usually an ethical issue,

709
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:52,823
but it's not a copyright violation
that involves punishment and compensation.

710
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:55,576
Yes, the line between plagiarism

711
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:58,078
and copyright infringement is very vague.

712
00:47:58,162 --> 00:48:01,040
You have perfect examples
of copyright infringement before you.

713
00:48:01,123 --> 00:48:03,250
They got
at least one illegal textbook copy.

714
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:10,716
You're giving a lecture before criminals
who have infringed copyright.

715
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:12,593
And of course, I've never done that.

716
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:15,637
She always does that.

717
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:19,516
Right, what about the Bad FaMa case?

718
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,143
The opinion is under way.

719
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,355
Make sure you do a good job and win.

720
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:25,898
I'm not doing it.

721
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:28,817
Then who? Sol A?

722
00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:32,237
It's going to be tough for her.

723
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,073
Only someone like you has a chance.

724
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:43,082
I'm very sorry.

725
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:47,169
It's important, so I need to do better,
but I can't seem to do it.

726
00:48:48,337 --> 00:48:49,546
This won't work.

727
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,759
I'm sorry. You trusted me with this.

728
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:55,761
You don't have my trust, so try again.

729
00:48:56,136 --> 00:48:58,055
What? Goodness.

730
00:48:58,138 --> 00:49:00,182
I have no idea how to argue she did this

731
00:49:00,265 --> 00:49:03,060
in the public interest,
not for personal revenge.

732
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:04,520
It's on her personal website.

733
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:07,272
The problem is that
she was already sued for libel before

734
00:49:07,356 --> 00:49:09,775
by other parents
who failed to pay child support

735
00:49:09,858 --> 00:49:11,652
and were exposed on her website,

736
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:12,861
then she was fined.

737
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:14,405
Is that a problem?

738
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:15,948
That means

739
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,660
there's a high chance
she'll be fined again…

740
00:49:22,704 --> 00:49:23,539
Wait.

741
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:27,418
This client was
already sued by many people

742
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:30,671
who refused to pay child support,
not just by her husband!

743
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,341
It proves she didn't upload their info
just for personal gain

744
00:49:34,425 --> 00:49:36,301
to make him pay the money.

745
00:49:39,138 --> 00:49:41,014
She also got together with informants

746
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:44,017
to go to the MOGEF
to publicize this problem,

747
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:46,270
then protested
before the National Assembly.

748
00:49:48,147 --> 00:49:49,523
Go eat something first.

749
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:53,193
Have you eaten already?

750
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:55,279
If you buy me jjajangmyeon, I'll--

751
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:57,489
My rule is never to eat with any students.

752
00:50:01,326 --> 00:50:04,204
I shouldn't have asked.
That was so embarrassing.

753
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:09,001
Hey, Ye-seul. Where are you?

754
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:12,754
Why? She still won't pick up?

755
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:13,797
She's on the phone.

756
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,883
Is something going on with Ye-seul?

757
00:50:18,135 --> 00:50:20,262
CLASS CANCELED

758
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:21,930
What? This is awesome.

759
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:25,267
That's odd. I thought
Prof. Kang never cancels his classes.

760
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:27,394
All right!

761
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:30,522
CLASS CANCELED

762
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,071
Excuse me.

763
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:40,032
Why was it canceled?

764
00:50:40,115 --> 00:50:42,910
Prof. Kang didn't come today.
I think he's sick.

765
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:47,247
Right, did you get your laptop
from the professor?

766
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:50,584
Yes, the security guard gave it to me.

767
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,669
I was told to give this to you.

768
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:54,463
Okay, thank you.

769
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:57,424
The security guard?
Well, I'm glad you got it back.

770
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:01,261
He kept asking me over and over again
if I'm sure it was yours.

771
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:06,975
One second.

772
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:10,646
I have something to ask you.

773
00:51:14,149 --> 00:51:16,276
I already paid everything I got on credit.

774
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,111
Stop asking me to buy food for you.

775
00:51:18,195 --> 00:51:21,156
You had to see Prof. Yang
to prepare for the trial anyway.

776
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,408
I have to eat, so start copying.

777
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:24,493
Why should I?

778
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:28,914
Can I tell your wife about that girl
you practically stalked?

779
00:51:28,997 --> 00:51:30,290
Do it.

780
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:32,709
-Should I?
-Do it. I'll do it. I will.

781
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,253
I'll do this.

782
00:51:35,754 --> 00:51:37,673
You never did this saying it's illegal.

783
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:39,466
You should take down that motto.

784
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,634
It's not illegal.

785
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:42,219
The copyright holder asked

786
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:44,388
to give it to students for free.

787
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:45,556
The copyright holder?

788
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:50,644
You're off duty, so the books are no use.

789
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:52,563
Yes, you can't have classes. So why?

790
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:54,773
I'll use those as soon as I win the trial.

791
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:56,817
You'll use those as soon as you win?

792
00:51:57,234 --> 00:51:59,611
He's telling you to do a great job
on his trial.

793
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:01,405
-Did you meet him?
-Who?

794
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:04,741
Yes, I did. But even if he had someone
behind him, he won't speak up.

795
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:07,744
He'll talk only after his case
ends as bodily harm.

796
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:10,205
The crazy man who stabbed Prof. Yang?

797
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:12,958
He's very skeptical,
and he's as sly as a fox.

798
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:16,253
I pleaded in his favor. Show him,

799
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:18,255
-then tell him I'll come see him.
-Okay.

800
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:23,385
He paid my fee in cash right away.

801
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:26,221
I wonder if he'll do well
on Prof. Yang's pro bono case.

802
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:29,141
I came to do that.
Let's get ready for the trial.

803
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:33,312
I have the arraignment
and a list of prosecution evidence,

804
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:37,566
then I went to the Prosecutors' Office
and copied the investigation record.

805
00:52:39,818 --> 00:52:40,944
Hand it out.

806
00:52:49,244 --> 00:52:50,454
What are you thinking?

807
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:51,788
PREPARATORY PROCEEDINGS

808
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:53,624
List of evidence from the prosecution.

809
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:55,834
These are real documents. So cool.

810
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:57,878
There is lots of evidence.

811
00:52:57,961 --> 00:52:58,837
Is that so?

812
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,632
Then I'll be done for good

813
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:02,924
thanks to this evidence.

814
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:09,056
Article 318.1, Criminal Procedure Act.

815
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:12,184
"Documents or articles the prosecutor
and the defendant agree on are

816
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:14,519
admissible as evidence if genuine."

817
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:17,481
The prosecutor
can't use everything as evidence.

818
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:18,857
The defendant must agree.

819
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,775
Right.

820
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:22,569
Then Prof. Yang can disagree
with everything against…

821
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,113
If he disagrees with everything,

822
00:53:25,197 --> 00:53:26,698
are we left with zero evidence?

823
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:28,033
Why would there be no…

824
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:34,539
Well, I have no time to explain that, so…

825
00:53:34,623 --> 00:53:36,667
We do. A minute and 30 seconds.

826
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:38,293
Come on.

827
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:42,464
Disapproving evidence
usually denies its validity,

828
00:53:42,547 --> 00:53:45,008
but what can the defendant do
by denying the weapon?

829
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,385
Will someone say,

830
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:48,887
"This knife isn't a knife!
This mace is lying"?

831
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,472
Then why do we do this?

832
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,891
Evidence admissibility
is useful with papers.

833
00:53:52,974 --> 00:53:54,601
Our testimonies to the prosecutor,

834
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:56,645
the medical examiner's report,

835
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:58,021
and my uncle's notes.

836
00:53:58,105 --> 00:54:01,066
With those, we have a chance
of making an argument saying,

837
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:02,359
"That person is lying."

838
00:54:02,442 --> 00:54:04,528
Right. And now--

839
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:05,821
If we dismiss documents?

840
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:13,328
We summon the testifier

841
00:54:13,412 --> 00:54:15,205
or the writer to court to have them

842
00:54:15,288 --> 00:54:16,498
take the stand.

843
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:19,876
And we judge the authenticity
of the said document.

844
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,837
Why are you getting mad at me?

845
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:25,632
Then let's decide which evidence
I should approve or disapprove.

846
00:54:25,716 --> 00:54:28,844
Wait, they're your key evidence.

847
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:31,054
You're asking your evidence
for their opinion?

848
00:54:31,138 --> 00:54:34,015
I got some investigation records.

849
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:36,351
Wait, we're showing all these to them?

850
00:54:36,435 --> 00:54:37,811
He's as crazy as you.

851
00:54:37,894 --> 00:54:39,730
He's off duty, so he's using his case

852
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:41,148
to hold a hands-on class.

853
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:43,900
But I'm saying
they are a part of this case.

854
00:54:43,984 --> 00:54:46,153
I've never seen the real record before.

855
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:49,030
This is huge.
We'll need at least 100 thimbles.

856
00:54:49,114 --> 00:54:51,241
Bad students always complain
about their gear.

857
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:53,285
Pass your bar exam first.

858
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:54,369
NFS AUTOPSY REPORT

859
00:54:54,453 --> 00:54:55,412
SEO BYUNG-JU

860
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,122
The autopsy report is dismissed.

861
00:54:57,205 --> 00:54:59,624
The examiner went AWOL,
so he can't be summoned either.

862
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:00,959
It'll be easy to dismiss.

863
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:03,170
Then isn't it good for Prof. Yang?

864
00:55:03,253 --> 00:55:05,297
We have no way of summoning the examiner?

865
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,507
I asked the embassy
and the Korean association

866
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:10,218
to look for him everywhere,
but he can't be located.

867
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,389
Since the examiner lives abroad

868
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:15,891
and can't be located,

869
00:55:15,974 --> 00:55:19,269
-so Article 314, Exception…
-Article 314, Criminal Procedure Act.

870
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:21,104
"If a person who's to make a statement

871
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:24,107
is unable to do so due to death, illness,
residence abroad,

872
00:55:24,191 --> 00:55:26,777
or any other similar cause,
the relevant report

873
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,613
and other documents
shall be admissible as evidence."

874
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:31,448
You're right. I was happy for nothing.

875
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:33,992
Approve his handwritten memo
to claim suicide.

876
00:55:34,075 --> 00:55:36,119
What about testifier statements?

877
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:38,455
All of them are your testifiers!

878
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:41,666
You're right. All the suspects are here.

879
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,752
-You should disapprove.
-If it wasn't him,

880
00:55:43,835 --> 00:55:46,338
that means one of you is lying.

881
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:49,174
-You should disapprove everything.
-Disapprove everything?

882
00:55:49,257 --> 00:55:52,093
Then how many witnesses should I summon?

883
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,264
Him. And him.

884
00:55:56,848 --> 00:55:58,016
Him, her, her, and him.

885
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:00,227
-They all testified.
-I did too.

886
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,021
Exactly. There are dozens of people.

887
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,816
You know how it is.
The trial will be too long.

888
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:08,652
-The judge won't summon all of them.
-I want to be a witness.

889
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:12,614
Prof. Yang may never eat with a student,
but he would never kill a man.

890
00:56:13,865 --> 00:56:14,908
Please approve mine.

891
00:56:14,991 --> 00:56:16,743
I don't want to take the stand.

892
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:19,079
And mine. I need that time to study.

893
00:56:19,496 --> 00:56:21,832
Seung-jae and I weren't even at the scene.

894
00:56:22,457 --> 00:56:25,043
If you look at my statement,
I barely said anything.

895
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:27,921
All right, now.
Take a good look at their statements,

896
00:56:28,004 --> 00:56:31,383
talk to the prosecutor,
and summon the least amount of people.

897
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:33,051
Let's disapprove his first.

898
00:56:34,135 --> 00:56:35,095
Whose statement?

899
00:56:35,804 --> 00:56:38,890
There's no reason to disapprove
Prof. Kang Ju-man's statement.

900
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,017
He didn't say much,

901
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:42,561
and he seems to hate you a lot.

902
00:56:42,644 --> 00:56:44,688
There's no reason
to have him as a witness.

903
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:46,481
Please have him as my first witness.

904
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:47,983
Why is the vice dean the first?

905
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:49,234
He changed his alibi.

906
00:56:56,283 --> 00:56:57,284
NEW MAIL

907
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:00,162
I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAPTOP, LET'S MEET

908
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:01,705
Let's call it a day.

909
00:57:01,788 --> 00:57:03,832
I need to find my laptop first.

910
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,187
CONTACTS: DAD

911
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,606
The phone is turned off.

912
00:57:27,689 --> 00:57:28,690
DAD

913
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:29,608
CONTACTS: MOM

914
00:57:31,693 --> 00:57:33,653
-What?
-Dad's phone is turned off.

915
00:57:33,737 --> 00:57:34,821
Put him on the phone.

916
00:57:34,905 --> 00:57:36,489
Come home if you want to talk.

917
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:39,284
Mom. Mom!

918
00:57:40,535 --> 00:57:41,745
Darn it.

919
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:07,395
Dad.

920
00:58:08,813 --> 00:58:09,731
Dad?

921
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:23,954
Vice Dean.

922
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:32,754
Aren't you leaving?

923
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:35,006
This is different from exposing debtors.

924
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,717
Unpaid child support isn't private debt,

925
00:58:37,801 --> 00:58:39,678
but a dereliction of a parent's duty.

926
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:43,223
The state must take responsibility
for the child's survival,

927
00:58:43,306 --> 00:58:45,100
thus making this a public issue.

928
00:59:22,178 --> 00:59:23,221
That day,

929
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:25,682
I brought the sugar packet.

930
00:59:28,268 --> 00:59:33,815
12:25 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

931
00:59:48,246 --> 00:59:49,456
Vice Dean.

932
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:52,375
It's your first class in the mock court.

933
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:53,501
How do you feel?

934
00:59:55,337 --> 00:59:56,921
Right. Yes.

935
00:59:58,256 --> 01:00:01,092
-Would you like some coffee?
-You stay. I'll make mine.

936
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:18,360
I have a sweet tooth.

937
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:21,821
If this is about her paper,

938
01:00:24,616 --> 01:00:26,618
I don't think I'll let this slide.

939
01:00:32,165 --> 01:00:34,167
You should've stopped the wrong decision

940
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,668
your wife and daughter made.

941
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:37,295
Your daughter copied my paper,

942
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:38,922
won an award in a contest,

943
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:42,050
then used it to get into the Law School.

944
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:45,929
Just as Prof. Yang said, I do not think
we should condone any illegal acts

945
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:48,640
in the admission process
of the Law School.

946
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,063
Just as Prof. Yang said,

947
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:59,317
you bribed the school,
called it a donation, then got to teach.

948
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:02,195
I don't think
that's something for you to say.

949
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:06,950
My daughter just did as her mother said.

950
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,751
I can see why
Hye-gyeong regretted marrying you.

951
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:21,005
Even if she made her do it,
your daughter could've stopped.

952
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:24,884
Vice Dean, as a renowned legal scholar,

953
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:27,804
you know this much better than I do.

954
01:01:28,471 --> 01:01:31,391
Your daughter doesn't qualify
to become a judicial officer.

955
01:01:38,148 --> 01:01:39,482
YANG JONG-HOON

956
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:43,027
Professor Yang.
I meant to call you, but I forgot.

957
01:01:44,279 --> 01:01:45,613
Yes, give me a second.

958
01:02:34,078 --> 01:02:35,246
I killed him.

959
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:39,250
Professor Seo Byung-ju.

960
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,347
You finally…

961
01:02:55,892 --> 01:02:57,227
found me.

962
01:03:32,136 --> 01:03:33,930
It was all me.

963
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:35,431
Can you prove it?

964
01:03:35,515 --> 01:03:37,475
Do you also think I'm a joke?

965
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:38,851
Why did you two meet up?

966
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:41,396
Tell him you couldn't tell
to hide our relationship.

967
01:03:41,479 --> 01:03:43,022
You can do that, right?

968
01:03:43,106 --> 01:03:44,315
You can't do this to me.

969
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:45,733
It's all your fault!

970
01:03:45,817 --> 01:03:48,194
Everyone has a thing
that triggers their trauma.

971
01:03:48,278 --> 01:03:50,071
I want to speak with you.

972
01:03:50,154 --> 01:03:51,447
Ye-seul's boyfriend.

973
01:03:51,531 --> 01:03:53,074
-Get in!
-I really don't like him.

974
01:03:53,157 --> 01:03:54,367
I'm the one who's shocked.

975
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,369
I had to come as my girl got scared.

976
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:58,997
Your boyfriend looks somewhat dangerous.

977
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,248
I'm worried.

978
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:02,500
So Professor Kang is your father?

979
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:04,586
Attend my trial tomorrow.

980
01:04:05,253 --> 01:04:06,504
Your dad's not at school.

981
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:08,256
Your dad will do something crazy.

982
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,052
