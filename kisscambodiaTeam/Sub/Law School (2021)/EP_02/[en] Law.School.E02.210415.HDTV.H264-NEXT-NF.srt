LAW SCHOOL

00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,728
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS, CASES
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

3
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:21,583
OCTOBER 2010

4
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:24,878
The victim will be hospitalized for weeks,
but you didn't apologize.

5
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:28,841
She should apologize to my sister first.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,634
"Victim"?

7
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:34,888
Kim Mi-ri bullied my twin sister.
She's the assailant.

8
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:38,434
The moment I saw her
setting my sister's hair on fire…

9
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:41,228
I lost it and punched her once.

10
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:43,314
-You punched her once?
-Correct.

11
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,482
There's no way she's that badly hurt.

12
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:48,068
-This is so unfair!
-Will you settle the case?

13
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:49,445
Are you kidding me?

14
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:53,032
Would you settle with a bully
who tortured your sister?

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,201
No, I'd just go to a juvie.

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,246
Juvie?

17
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,417
-What if I agree to settle the case?
-Probation.

18
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:09,298
Is she that kid?

19
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:13,719
The scumbag who has no remorse
for beating up someone?

20
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:17,598
Mister, who are you to call me a scumbag?

21
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:20,768
Kim Mi-ri is not showing any remorse
whatsoever.

22
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,686
Chief Prosecutor is her father.

23
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,026
If she apologizes for what she did
to my sister, I'll do the same.

24
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:34,073
But you shouldn't use your position
to help your daughter.

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,952
Send her to jail,
not the detention center.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,456
She needs to be convicted
to learn her lesson.

27
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,208
After beating up someone,

28
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,377
she won't settle the case,
let alone apologize.

29
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:50,714
Which is why, instead of probation,
she'll be sent to the detention center.

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,466
What?

31
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,385
We cannot force her to apologize.

32
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:58,555
-It's against the freedom of conscience--
-Hey! Prosecutor Yang!

33
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,307
If you'd like a sincere apology,

34
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,351
-tell your daughter to--
-What?

35
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,732
Come to my office!

36
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:15,155
Prosecutor Yang.

37
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:23,205
I'm hungry. Let's order food.

38
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,251
You should go to his office now.

39
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,378
Order some food for her.

40
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:35,175
You are the assailant in this case
because you hit her.

41
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,220
Right, so I should reflect on my actions.

42
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:41,807
I was going to,

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,060
but can I have some food first?

44
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:47,271
-Is this the Great Wall?
-Extra pickles for me.

45
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,732
Extra pickles, please.

46
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:13,380
TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY BY THE LAW

47
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:17,509
Don't push.

48
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,510
Step backward.

49
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,262
-Don't push.
-It's him.

50
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,639
-Did you admit to the charges?
-A comment, please!

51
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:24,641
-Did you kill him?
-Do you admit to it?

52
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,227
I thought he was asleep.

53
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,480
<i>I was so shocked.</i>

54
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:33,066
My heart still races
whenever I think about it.

55
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,527
When I went there,
Professor Seo was alone.

56
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:36,987
He had a headache, so I left.

57
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,115
-I can go now, right?
-Did you hear anything?

58
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,992
The door opening, for example.

59
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,286
Should I just say I did?

60
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:45,621
-Tell us!
-Did you kill him?

61
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:47,080
Do you admit to the charges?

62
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,290
Did you kill him?

63
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:49,291
Why did you do it?

64
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,504
Did you do it alone?

65
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:55,088
Because of a personal grudge?

66
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,298
Give us a comment!

67
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:00,636
<i>Why did you go there?</i>

68
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,556
My footprints mean nothing
if you've arrested Professor Yang.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,766
Right, but--

70
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,310
You should focus on proving
that he is indeed guilty.

71
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:11,813
Just a comment, please!

72
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:13,148
Was it planned?

73
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:14,775
-Over here!
-Did you do it alone?

74
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,568
-Did you do it?
-Over grudges?

75
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:17,861
Just a comment, please!

76
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:19,988
CITIZENS' POLICE
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 1

77
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:22,699
This.

78
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:24,409
This.

79
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:26,620
And this too.

80
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:29,456
We lifted your prints off these,

81
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:35,295
which proves that you opened the lid,
put methamphetamine into the coffee,

82
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,967
and offered it to Seo Byung-ju.

83
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,762
If I killed him,
you wouldn't find my prints anywhere.

84
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:48,559
Prints are often left at the scene
if it occurred on the spur of the moment.

85
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:52,646
You two were very close
during your prosecutor days

86
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,982
but had a falling-out
due to the bribery case.

87
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,068
<i>You quit being a prosecutor</i>
<i>because of him.</i>

88
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,695
Clearly, you had a motive.

89
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:02,114
Then I would've killed him
a long time ago.

90
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,327
Pro-running AF, 270mm.

91
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:10,664
You wore the exact same running shoes
on the day of the incident.

92
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:14,251
But we couldn't find them anywhere
in your home or your office.

93
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:19,589
You threw them out to conceal the fact
that this impression is yours.

94
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:20,757
You destroyed evidence.

95
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:22,217
And your laptop?

96
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:26,388
Your TA said you use your laptop
to prepare for your classes.

97
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,056
<i>It's not at school or at your home.</i>

98
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:31,059
I lost it.

99
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,146
You lost it?

100
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:37,649
You just happened to lose your laptop

101
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,944
right after the incident?

102
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,948
If you think it can be used as evidence,
please find it.

103
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,533
You'll weasel out like this?

104
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,828
As for the running shoes,
ask Mr. Sung Dong-il in the copy room.

105
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:53,123
Detective Oh, ask him now.

106
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,626
I heard you used to work with him.

107
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,546
-Yes.
-Are you all right?

108
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:01,882
We had to arrest him.

109
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:03,925
We were afraid he'd flee.

110
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:08,805
You see, we'd never cuff
a Hankuk University law professor

111
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,267
in front of his students
without sufficient evidence.

112
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,438
You would've left the country
had we not arrested you.

113
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,274
The night of the incident,

114
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,569
you booked a flight to Boston for today.

115
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:24,863
A one-way flight, not a round trip.

116
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,490
E-TICKET ITINERARY

117
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,867
PASSPORT

118
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,455
E-TICKET ITINERARY

119
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,086
A one-way flight? Why?

120
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,421
To never come back?

121
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:43,674
But why?

122
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:52,683
The copy room is closed.

123
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,686
I can't reach Sung Dong-il.

124
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,146
What? You mean, he's gone AWOL?

125
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:03,276
Don't tell me you killed him too.

126
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,490
Instead of your missing laptop,

127
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,743
we'll have to look through this.

128
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:13,537
Unlock it for us.

129
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:17,958
Using my fingerprint this way
is considered coercion.

130
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,710
"Coercion"?

131
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,297
What does your fingerprint
have to do with--

132
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,133
If you use my fingerprint this way

133
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:29,344
to coerce a confession,
it'll be considered unlawful.

134
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,310
What's in this thing?

135
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,148
As of this moment, I plead the Fifth.

136
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:47,946
Request a warrant
and send this to Digital Forensics.

137
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:49,364
Yes, sir.

138
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:57,414
You have to watch out for jerks
who know the law well.

139
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:59,124
I heard there were injection marks.

140
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:01,752
<i>From insulin injections.</i>
<i>The victim was diabetic.</i>

141
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,671
<i>The methamphetamine was administered</i>
<i>in powder form.</i>

142
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,299
<i>None of the suspects</i>
<i>has handled a syringe before.</i>

143
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:11,052
If personal grudge was the motive,
ask Oh to be a character witness.

144
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:14,014
He must've witnessed them
having a falling-out.

145
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:41,792
Just unlock it.

146
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,045
If you don't,
the police will suspect you more.

147
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:52,010
Are the DNA results out?

148
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,390
Okay.

149
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,688
The hair found in Seo Byung-ju's hand
is also yours.

150
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,984
You should hire an attorney.

151
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,955
What's going on? Why did they arrest you?

152
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:20,872
For murder?

153
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,207
Please uncuff him.

154
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,876
Do you have an attorney?
Have you hired one yet?

155
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,461
What is going on?

156
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:31,424
Oh, my TA has the flash drive
with all the exam questions.

157
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:39,724
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

158
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:40,642
Hey, Seo Ji-ho.

159
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,645
Professor Yang got arrested
in front of us.

160
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:46,648
Does finishing the mock trial
even matter in this situation?

161
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:49,860
I don't want to make time for this again,
with midterms coming up.

162
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:52,821
-Even so--
-Study like your life depends on it.

163
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,031
This time, it's do well or die.

164
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,742
-Don't even say that word.
-My gosh!

165
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:00,245
There's a video of Yangcrates' arrest
on the Internet.

166
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:01,288
What?

167
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:02,998
-Here.
-Many people have watched it.

168
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,082
Who posted this?

169
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:05,000
SUSPECT ARRESTED

170
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,544
What? You can see his face in this video!

171
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,296
Who did this? This is defamation--

172
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,797
It's what a murderer deserves.

173
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,299
Who is a murderer?

174
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,676
He might be evil in class

175
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,969
but can't be a killer.

176
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,556
-Something's gone terribly wrong.
-What's your point?

177
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:21,683
Why did you ask us to stay?

178
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:25,145
What I'm trying to say is…

179
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,148
Why don't we submit a petition
to the police?

180
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,150
Let's tell them he'd never do
such a thing.

181
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,610
Can you be sure?

182
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,863
-What?
-Are we sure he'd never do that?

183
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:42,037
Yes. The Professor Yang I know
would never kill anyone.

184
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,038
No.

185
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,082
On what grounds?

186
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,044
They may release him in 48 hours.

187
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,712
He's innocent until proven guilty.

188
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,255
The presumption of innocence.

189
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:55,258
"Innocence"?

190
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:57,761
He was deemed guilty
the moment they cuffed him.

191
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:58,845
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

192
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:02,807
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

193
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,895
If you're going to the police station,
ask Professor Yang

194
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,938
about our Criminal Code exam.

195
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,153
What? Ask him about the exam?

196
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,696
For real?

197
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,697
-Yes.
-Yes.

198
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,570
<i>-Nothing's been confirmed yet.</i>
<i>-We know nothing.</i>

199
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,406
<i>-"Law school murderer"?</i>
<i>-We have no way</i>

200
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,740
of knowing what the police…

201
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:02,617
-The police are on it.
-We want to know.

202
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,619
-It's not true.
-Someone else will do it?

203
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:05,537
It's not that.

204
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,956
Professor Yang already wrote
all the exam questions.

205
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,708
-We know nothing.
-They're useless.

206
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,210
He can't even mark the exams now.

207
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,795
The police may release him.

208
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:16,965
The police arrested
a Hankuk University law professor

209
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,718
in front of his students
without a warrant.

210
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,386
They wouldn't do it for no reason.

211
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,888
Look, the phone's ringing off the hook!

212
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:26,683
-That's--
-Everyone is in panic mode now.

213
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:30,270
The dean's been meeting
with the president every day,

214
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:32,522
and the alumni have been complaining.

215
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:34,858
The president is worried
they'd halt funding.

216
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:37,277
Professor Yang has done so much harm
to the school.

217
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,903
What if they release him?

218
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:41,906
If the police fail to get
an arrest warrant within 48 hours--

219
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,075
The warrant has been issued.

220
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:49,247
We can't revise our academic calendar
because of Professor Yang.

221
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,590
I'm telling you.
These running shoes are mine.

222
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:01,342
That day,
I had to attend a funeral unexpectedly.

223
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,887
Clothes-wise, I was okay,
but I only had these runners,

224
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,847
so Professor Yang lent me his shoes.

225
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,558
And it's not like
I intentionally avoided your calls.

226
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,852
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

227
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,106
My leg got trapped by a subway train,
so I was in the hospital.

228
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,234
Here, look at this.

229
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,320
You were hospitalized?

230
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,322
I dropped my phone and broke the screen.

231
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,073
And Professor Yang got arrested.

232
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,743
My goodness, talk about bad timing.

233
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:30,205
Anyway, I swear
I didn't purposely avoid your calls…

234
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,249
I swear. Please believe me.

235
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,584
You can look into it.

236
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,920
Check my hospital bill and track my phone.

237
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:39,172
Sure. You're done talking, right?

238
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,090
What?

239
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,050
What about the shoes?

240
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,178
Right, where are the shoes?

241
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:49,140
The doctor ran all kinds of tests,
so they kept moving me around.

242
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:51,059
-From a two-person room--
-You lost them?

243
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:52,477
Yes, for real.

244
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,229
No worries. It's tainted evidence.

245
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:57,774
I can go?

246
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:00,985
I'd like to see him since I'm here anyway.

247
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,570
Go to the detention center.

248
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:04,781
We've handed him over.

00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,116
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 1

250
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,537
ARRESTED AS PRIME SUSPECT

251
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,122
No wonder he got arrested.

252
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,456
What was he thinking?

253
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,041
Why didn't he hire an attorney?

254
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,045
Didn't he have one for the warrant review?

255
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:21,965
He refused to hire one,
so the court got him a public defender.

256
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,426
He's a Hankuk Law graduate,
but a total nutcase.

257
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,345
Him being a public defender is comedy.

258
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:28,847
Don't blame him.

259
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:31,891
I heard Professor Yang shut him up
and said nothing

260
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,518
in front of the judge.

261
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:35,228
Jeez.

262
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:38,064
He should be vehemently protesting
his innocence.

263
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:41,693
This punk should keep his mouth shut
to help him.

264
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,199
But what if Professor Yang
had nothing to prove or explain?

265
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:51,703
Maybe he really killed him.

266
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,668
Got a death wish?

267
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:03,756

Oh, boy.

271
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:19,022
My gosh.

272
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,274
The trial ran late.

273
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:24,152
The judge went on
about gender sensitivity.

274
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:26,988
Hello.

275
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:29,657
Where were we?

276
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:37,582
You got a warrant

277
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,001
to get his phone unlocked?

278
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:44,964
Looks like you have no choice.

"Jurae-dong hit-and-run case"?

283
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,248
Wait, stop.

285
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:23,503
Is this the car?

286
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:29,342
We found this near the crime scene.

287
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,886
The hit-and-run happened
when you were headed home

288
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,137
after committing the act.

289
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:38,184
You passed by the scene on your way home,
so try to remember.

290
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,062
Did you see the driver
who hit the kid and fled?

291
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:44,941
He says he was too drunk
to even remember raping the girl.

292
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:47,443
Even if he saw the car,
he wouldn't remember.

293
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,946
-Right?
-If you're playing dumb

294
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,948
to use feeble-mindedness as an excuse--

295
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:54,492
If that's what you're doing,
don't even try.

296
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:57,954
I never fall for that bullshit.

297
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,456
A life sentence, right?

298
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,458
He'll rot in jail
for the rest of his life.

299
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,461
He could get beaten to death in there,
if he's unlucky.

300
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,841
If you saw it, just say so.

301
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,932
Well, I'm just curious.

302
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:20,727
If I say that I saw the license plate,

303
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:23,688
what will you do for me?

304
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,482
-You saw it?
-You saw it?

307
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,198
Wait.

Don't tell me Prosecutor Seo is…

311
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:49,213
He definitely saw the car.

312
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:52,258
He's insisting he doesn't remember
to be deemed feeble-minded.

313
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:54,844
Tell him he won't get his way.

314
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,680
Then I'll persuade him to give us a lead…

315
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,061
Feeble-mindedness due to alcoholism…

316
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:05,646
is right.

317
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:21,037
Prosecutor, how did it…

318
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:25,333
What's wrong?

319
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,878
How could Prosecutor Seo…

320
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,554
LAW SCHOOL

321
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:41,265
Guys!

322
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:44,477
Prof. Jung's writing our exam questions
instead of Prof. Yang.

323
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,895
He hasn't been indicted yet.

324
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:49,232
He was taken into custody
and got arrested right away,

325
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,859
so I bet they think
he'll be indicted for sure.

326
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,489
Do you have his old exams?

327
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:00,660
He hates students talking about
his exam questions,

328
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:02,203
so he takes the question sheets.

329
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,038
I bet there's nothing.

330
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,208
Who took Professor Jung's class?

331
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:12,630
The batch right before us
couldn't take his class

332
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:14,549
because he was on sabbatical.

333
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,301
Can you get his old exams?

334
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:18,386
Me?

335
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:21,681
You got an A+ on all your finals.
What's your secret?

336
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:23,766
That's…

337
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:27,562
Professor Jung Dae-hyeon's old exams.
Join me in the study room.

338
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:33,901
-Hey, come on.
-What?

339
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:34,819
What is it?

340
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,029
Seung-jae, are you coming?

341
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:38,489
Yes.

342
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:48,166
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

343
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:51,711
I have no idea why you pleaded the Fifth
and got a public defender.

344
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,254
Stop this.

345
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:55,590
Can my exam take place
before the Civil Code exam?

346
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,634
Why can't law professors
practice law on the side?

347
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:01,888
If the Legal Clinic professors
were allowed to do it,

348
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,015
-I'd be your attorney.
-The exam schedule--

349
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:06,184
Who cares about that?
You've been arrested!

350
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,311
What the heck are you thinking?

351
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,063
The questions that you wrote…

352
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:14,567
They'll be useless.

353
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,781
Professor Jung will rewrite them
instead of you.

354
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:22,825
That won't happen.

355
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:24,911
Don't you see what's going on?

356
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:27,205
If you get indicted, you'll lose your job.

357
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:31,083
Tell the vice dean
I must speak to him in person.

358
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:34,504
So what if he comes here?
Will it change anything?

359
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:37,548
Professor Yang!

360
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,093
Gosh, that stubborn man.

361
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:48,768
Please begin.

362
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:56,150
CRIMINAL CODE MIDTERM EXAM
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

363
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:05,660
<i>Student A, who is against</i>

364
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:08,955
<i>the faculty appointment of Lawyer B,</i>
<i>a former chief prosecutor,</i>

365
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,791
<i>put up this notice</i>
<i>on the school bulletin board.</i>

366
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,628
<i>You can access the petition below</i>
<i>by scanning the QR code on it.</i>

367
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:18,965
MARCH 2020

368
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:20,299
What is this?

369
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:21,467
-This is weird.
-Hey.

370
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:23,302
Hey.

371
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:30,935
What's this?

372
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,144
What?

373
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:33,354
A petition?

374
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:34,897
What a way to trick people.

375
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:36,941
We have to sign it to join him?

376
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,820
Studying with the second-round passer.
It is very enticing.

377
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:43,072
You'll do this?
You have your own study group.

378
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:45,157
He passed the second-round judicial exam.

379
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:47,618
But should I sign this or not?

380
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,328
Do it and piss the school off?

381
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:50,413
Sign what?

382
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,879
"Compensation for unlawful acts."

383
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:02,300
If I were to choose the worst one,
I'd pick defamation.

384
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,635
This one is the biggest headache.

385
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,929
What did you learn
in your Criminal Code class?

386
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:08,514
What constitutes as defamation?

387
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:11,100
Publicly alleging detailed facts
that devalue

388
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:12,727
or harm someone's reputation.

389
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,312
Oh, okay.

390
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:15,938
But the thing is,

391
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:19,275
we also need to look at
whether it's likely to spread

392
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,901
and whether it's a true fact.

393
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:24,530
There's a fine line
between criticism and slander.

394
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:27,283
COMPENSATION FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS

395
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:33,831
SIGN THE PETITION!

396
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:36,834
Who's seen this petition
on the bulletin board?

397
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:42,048
Okay.

398
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:46,177
I heard the student who put it up
is also here.

399
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,266
Go take it down at once.

400
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,978
Then I wouldn't even have bothered
getting it approved.

401
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:57,897
You refuse to take it down?

402
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:00,358
-Yes.
-What?

403
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,275
Please.

404
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,279
What's your name?

405
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:07,031
I'm Han Joon-hwi.

406
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:10,576
The school will take legal action
against you based on

407
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:13,788
Article 307 of the Criminal Code
and Article 750 of the Civil Code.

408
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:16,707
You'll be held liable for all damages
caused by your statement.

409
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:19,919
Hire an attorney.

410
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,883
-My gosh.
-What is going on?

411
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,551
-What will happen now?
-No idea.

412
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:28,719
That was scary.

413
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:34,225
<i>The school warned A</i>
<i>that they would take legal action</i>

414
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:38,604
<i>if he did not take down the notice</i>
<i>and stopped petitioning at once,</i>

415
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:39,939
<i>but A refused.</i>

416
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:43,192
<i>Can A be legally punished for his action?</i>

417
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:45,986
<i>What conditions must be met</i>
<i>for him to be punished?</i>

418
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:50,324
<i>It's a false defamatory statement.</i>

419
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:51,742
<i>It's just my opinion.</i>

420
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:54,954
Studying law with the donation
that caused a bribery scandal…

421
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,205
It's humiliating.

422
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,500
Defamation is a false statement of fact,
not opinion.

423
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,920
But you wrote that the school hired Seo
as a professor

424
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:06,674
because of his donation as if it's a fact
and questioned their "real motive."

425
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:09,343
You wrote this without checking the facts.

426
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,053
You're spreading false information.

427
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:14,473
I just wanted them to clear the suspicion.

428
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,059
I guess it can be seen that way.

429
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,353
So you admit it's false info?

430
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:20,438
CHECK, "REAL MOTIVE"

431
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:24,108
He'll be subject to a criminal punishment
even if it's a fact.

432
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:26,861
Wordings such as "bribery scandal"
and "real motive"

433
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:29,113
-defame the school and Seo Byung-ju--
-Why?

434
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:31,740
If it was in the public interest,
he won't be.

435
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:33,117
Justification.

436
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,370
<i>It's not like he did it</i>
<i>for his own selfish gain.</i>

437
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:39,290
<i>As Hankuk Law students,</i>
<i>we have the right to know.</i>

438
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:42,126
<i>Let's be honest.</i>
<i>The timing is very suspicious.</i>

439
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:44,462
Getting hired
right after making the donation.

440
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:47,465
<i>Just because it seems suspicious</i>
<i>doesn't mean it's a fact.</i>

441
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:51,469
SIGN THE PETITION!
WITHDRAW B'S APPOINTMENT!

442
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:00,644
FALSE INFORMATION

443
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:02,563
FACT

444
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:27,546
Prosecutor Yang, what are you doing here?

445
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:31,091
At first,

446
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,637
the detectives suspected me.

447
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,098
When I proved my alibi,

448
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,394
they didn't even hide
their disappointment.

449
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:48,484
Gosh, I'm his attorney.
Why do I have to wait outside?

450
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:52,488
Do you guys have a microwave here?

451
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:53,906
Hey, seriously.

452
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,450
I thought this would shackle me down.

453
00:25:57,535 --> 00:25:58,702
Who knew it'd help me?

454
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:03,165
Thanks to this, I could prove
that I wasn't at the murder scene.

455
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,544
Now, do you remember?

456
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:33,250
Damn it.

457
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:35,961
Hey! Wait!

458
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,296
Stop for a second.

459
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,423
Wait! Stop!

460
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,109
07P 4295

461
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,281
This is what I saw.

462
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,992
07P 4295

463
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:08,994
Lawyer Seo Byung-ju…

464
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,622
Oh, right.
He was a prosecutor at the time.

465
00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:17,044
Prosecutor Seo told me
that I must take it to my grave,

466
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:20,673
so I had no choice.

467
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:24,760
Is that why you went to Seo Byung-ju
and got a job as his driver?

468
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,347
I had nothing else going on,
so I asked him just in case.

469
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:29,848
And he hired me.

470
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:31,809
Jeez.

471
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:34,019
Just to cover up his hit-and-run accident,

472
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:37,856
he accepted my argument that
I was feeble-minded and let me out.

473
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,275
I guess he wanted to keep me close

474
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,236
for his peace of mind.

475
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,320
That bastard…

476
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:47,950
God…

477
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,036
KANG SOL A

478
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,496
Time's up.

479
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,207
Put your pens down. Hands in your laps.

480
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,125
Gosh.

481
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,132
Time's up. She can't keep writing.

482
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,174
Hey, you!

483
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:05,092
Put your pen down.

484
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,678
I'll tell your professor.

485
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:09,471
-Wait.
-Hand it in.

486
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,973
-Just a second.
-Hand it in now.

487
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,391
-Come on.
-Just a second!

488
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:13,309
No!

489
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,772
His attempt to cover up the hit-and-run…

490
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:20,607
<i>CODE OF LAW</i>

491
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:22,234
…cost him his life.

492
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:24,903
When you found out

493
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,825
that he was the culprit
behind your only cold case,

494
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,370
you must've been awfully shocked.

495
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:38,167
I, too, would've felt so betrayed
and wanted to kill him.

496
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,670
Okay, we have a motive.

497
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:42,671
We sure do.

498
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:51,263
-Hand him over to the prosecution.
-Okay.

499
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:55,351
Wait, but…

500
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,810
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

501
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:02,733
A is Han Joon-hwi, and B is Seo Byung-ju.

502
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,361
Gosh, how could Yangcrates give us
a question like this?

503
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,071
Especially given the situation.

504
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:10,282
He's a sociopath. Would Joon-hwi
want to solve this question?

505
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:11,367
Yeah, he seemed fine.

506
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:14,078
I grieved as I solved this.

507
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:16,163
I couldn't stop thinking of Professor Seo.

508
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,874
If Yangcrates killed him…
I'm getting shivers.

509
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,168
What's going to happen to Sol now?

510
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:23,045
She should get a zero.

511
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,880
She only handed it in 30 seconds late.

512
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,341
That's a lot.
We all could've used extra time.

513
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,885
Won't you benefit the most
if she gets a zero?

514
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,388
-You two are at the bottom.
-Hey, watch what you say!

515
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,472
I did well this time.

516
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,517
Isn't the answer,
"False information, defamation"?

517
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,851
Yeah, obviously.

518
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:39,395
Ms. Oh proved it.

519
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,897
PROVING THE ALLEGATION WRONG

520
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,317
Everything about the alleged deal
is not true.

521
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,236
See it for yourself.

522
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,654
-For real?
-Is that true?

523
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:49,988
-Look at that.
-My gosh.

524
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,244
This proves
that there was nothing unlawful

525
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,745
about his appointment.

526
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,666
Do not expect any leniency.

527
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,669
We'll hold a disciplinary hearing
and decide

528
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:06,338
whether to expel you
or cancel your admission altogether.

529
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:16,432
I didn't know it was a false allegation.

530
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:21,895
Article 307-2 of the Criminal Code
states that

531
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:24,189
the alleged fact must be false

532
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:26,316
and the one making the allegation

533
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,319
must be aware of it
in order for it to qualify as defamation.

534
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:31,447
If the person believed that it was true,

535
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,449
it can't be considered an illegal act.

536
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,869
You believed such a deal
actually took place?

537
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:41,373
That means
you don't trust the school at all.

538
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:44,918
It means he doesn't trust me at all.

539
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,798
I always said any freebies
are considered bribes,

540
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,593
yet I accepted free land as a gift.

541
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,763
I understand why he doesn't trust me.

542
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,103
<i>You quit the judicial exam</i>

543
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,606
and even got yourself in trouble here.

544
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:09,193
What are you doing?

545
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,322
Whose fault is it that I gave up?

546
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,074
Make a donation and leave.

547
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,243
I don't want you to come here.

548
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:19,870
Must you do this?

549
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,126
Yes.

550
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:30,172
I came here
so I wouldn't turn out like you.

551
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,673
I refuse to learn from you.

552
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,178
Don't you know that you're not qualified
to teach at a law school?

553
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,181
As for the bribe, I was found not guilty--

554
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,934
You got away with it
because they couldn't prove it.

555
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,313
Stop toying with the law
and deceiving people.

556
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,026
Joon-hwi.

557
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,529
I'm sick of asking you
how you ended up in this mess.

558
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,659
I don't care what you do, Uncle.

559
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:00,827
Just stay out of my sight.

560
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,752
Must you make such a fuss? Oh, dear.

561
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,964
Think about how much money
he's given them.

562
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:14,967
What's the big deal
about getting hired as a professor?

563
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,818
Jeez.

564
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:38,699
What's going on?

565
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:40,409
What's with you and Professor Seo?

566
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,785
I know there's something.

567
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:44,204
Hey, what's going on?

568
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:46,957
-You need ointment.
-No.

569
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,626
Tell me, or I'll drag you.

570
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:54,881
He's my uncle.

571
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,717
What?

572
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:02,347
Hey, Joon-hwi!

573
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:06,059
So you have it out for your own uncle?

574
00:33:07,144 --> 00:33:10,355
You want to ruin your own future
because he betrayed your trust?

575
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,941
If you get expelled,
what about my studies?

576
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,861
Darn it! I signed the petition, you know.

577
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,280
KANG SOL A

578
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:22,075
Look, this dot here.

579
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,328
This is my signature.

580
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:25,996
It's tiny, but…

581
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,373
Gosh, fine.

582
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:31,376
I wanted to study with you
but didn't want the school to hate me.

583
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,794
So I used this trick.

584
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,257
Do you think you can win against Ms. Oh?

585
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,678
Enough, okay?

586
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,638
Yes, enough.

587
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,307
Ms. Oh was a Supreme Court justice.

588
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,100
-Don't regret this.
-My point exactly.

589
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:49,227
Don't regret it later. Just take it down.

590
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:52,064
Ms. Oh is clearly out to get you.

591
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:53,440
-Am I?
-What?

592
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,490
You think I'm out to get Joon-hwi?

593
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,533
Oh, you heard that?

594
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:07,204
Just before that, I said
he should listen to you and take it down.

595
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:08,372
Right?

596
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,749
I said that.

597
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:13,877
I hear the police interviewed you?

598
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,755
Ms. Oh, please give me a chance.

599
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,924
-I promise you I'll persuade him--
-No.

600
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,178
I'll never take it down of my own accord.

601
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,055
Then I'll do it.

602
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:26,390
If you give me a chance,

603
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:30,185
I'll show you that
you're indeed out to get me.

604
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,984
-Did you finish photocopying it?
-Yes, here.

606
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,406

What's going on?

608
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:47,452
Read this and refer to it
while writing my defense argument.

609
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:48,829
No, I don't want to.

610
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,330
Stop talking nonsense.

611
00:34:50,414 --> 00:34:51,915
I can't defend you.

612
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:54,876
I agree. It makes no sense.

613
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:58,380
How will you trust that girl
with such an unfit legal mind?

614
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,757
These are all recent. Do more research.

615
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:01,967
No, I can't do this.

616
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,760
I can't. Your future depends on this.

617
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,930
Why me?
There are so many smart people here.

618
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:10,475
Hey, there are many people
who'd happily defend you.

619
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,810
You really think so?

620
00:35:12,853 --> 00:35:15,814
Who will side with me,
knowing I'm fighting against the school?

621
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:21,361
Come on. You can still do better than her.

622
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:24,239
She said "self-comfort"
instead of "self-help."

623
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:29,536
Why glare at me?
I just deeply empathize with you.

624
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,079
What if I do it?

625
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,165
I know you can't do it.

626
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,876
I can! What will you do if I pull it off?

627
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,127
You can't.

628
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:40,839
Hire me if I pull it off.

629
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:41,923
Deal!

630
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,761
So just study this first, right?

631
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:49,556
I studied the defamation law so much.

632
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,853
Gosh, I should've just handed it in
on time.

633

634
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:59,608
Didn't it say you must allocate
enough time for each question?

635
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,278
Gosh, why did I change my answer?

636
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:07,616
I won't actually get a zero, right?

637
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,080
Go beg him if you're that worried.

638
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:16,666
I can't do that.

639
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:19,252
-You'll visit him.
-That's…

00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:49,337
SEO BYUNG-JU, HAN JOON-HWI

707
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:12,402
MY UNCLE CAME AS SOON AS I CALLED

708
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:43,058
I know you're wondering why I came
all the way here

709
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,769
when I didn't even let you
attend his funeral.

710
00:40:53,193 --> 00:40:54,944
RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE

711
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:57,197
It's not like I wanted to come here.

712
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:01,076
I have no idea why your name
is in your uncle's will,

713
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:03,953
which he had written before he died.

714
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,916
This is for you
to disclaim your inheritance.

715
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:10,960
So, it's about money.

716
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:16,424
We don't even know who killed him yet.

717
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:20,512
The police will catch
and punish the killer.

718
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:25,016
Even if Professor Yang
actually killed him,

719
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:26,976
I hate you more than him.

720
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:31,356
I want to stop hating you,

721
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,819
so sign it before I leave Korea.

722
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:43,993
RENUNCIATION OF INHERITANCE
HAN JOON-HWI, SEO BYUNG-JU

723
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:13,273
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

724
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:22,991
JIN HYEONG-U

725
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:26,870
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

726
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:37,714
Can you go pick up an iced Americano?

727
00:42:39,174 --> 00:42:40,049
Pardon me?

728
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,474
I really didn't want to see him again
like this.

729
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,898
We had no choice but to arrest him but…

730
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:56,065
Hand over the keys.

731
00:42:57,984 --> 00:43:00,236
We should treat him politely,

732
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:04,282
-with respect.
-Yes, sir.

733
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,827
My gosh! I'm sorry.

734
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:12,290
Gosh, the traffic was so bad.

735
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:13,499
My apologies.

736
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:16,878
Oh, right. I'm Park Geun-tae,
his attorney.

737
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:17,921
Catch your breath.

738
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:19,797
No, just sit over there.

739
00:43:20,673 --> 00:43:22,634
-Shall I?
-There's no time to waste.

740
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,428
Oh, right.

741
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,223
Do you want to be cordial
to your ex-colleague?

742
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:32,227
Right, yes.

743
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:39,150
Then let me work on this.

744
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,528
Do it at once.

745
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:45,448
Fire Yang Jong-hoon.

746
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,451
But we don't have
the court's decision yet.

747
00:43:48,534 --> 00:43:49,452
Don't you know

748
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,331
people don't care about that?

749
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:55,458
They're enraged by the suspicion.

750
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:58,211
We can't let the court of public opinion
sway us.

751
00:43:58,294 --> 00:44:01,172
According to our rules,
he needs to be indicted for us to--

752
00:44:01,256 --> 00:44:03,174
Then change the rules and get him fired!

753
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:07,053
Calm down. He's been handed over
to the prosecution, so let's wait--

754
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:08,596
Who do you have to thank

755
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:11,224
for your mock courtroom?

756
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:16,646
If you don't do as I say,
you'll regret it later on.

757
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:20,441
The people who can make large donations
to the school

758
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:23,820
care a great deal about public opinion.

759
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:30,034
I'll go.

760
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:32,412
Sir.

761
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:37,333
I get he's in the Committee,
but he's overstepping the bounds.

762
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,627
You're frustrating me here.

763
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:43,589
If we piss him off,
we'll see a massive drop in donations.

764
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:47,427
You shouldn't say that,
knowing your law school spends the most.

765
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,553
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

766
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:56,227
ANSWER SHEET

767
00:44:57,979 --> 00:44:59,355
Just confess to the crime.

768
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,568
I'm letting you mark your exams
and even bought you coffee.

769
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:09,157
He wishes to take the Fifth all the way.

770
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,746
Since there's plenty of evidence,
we can indict you

771
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,956
right away even without your confession.

772
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,128
That means marking these

773
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:24,505
is pointless, right?

774
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,638
If you get indicted,
you'll lose your job right away.

775
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:34,474
Isn't this a complete waste of time?

776
00:45:37,894 --> 00:45:40,980
If you say you'll confess to the crime,
I'll let you finish…

777
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,859
I'll be done soon. Just talk to him.

778
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:51,240
He doesn't want to explain himself here.
He'll do it in the courtroom.

779
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:15,056
I let the kids use this room so they could
study, but they made such a mess.

780
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,063
Why do you seem so down?

781
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:24,774
Because of Professor Yang.

782
00:46:28,528 --> 00:46:29,862
This will lift your spirits.

783
00:46:29,946 --> 00:46:30,863
<i>DEFAMATION CASES</i>

784
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,826
MARCH 2020

785
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:38,037
Mr. Sung turned all the cases we found
into a book for us.

786
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:39,122
For free.

787
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:41,582
It was so much work
to find all those cases.

788
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,459
It's rewarding though.

789
00:46:44,252 --> 00:46:46,420
We found every single precedent
on defamation.

790
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,172
Counsel, you may make your argument.

791
00:46:48,256 --> 00:46:49,173
THE ACCUSED

792
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:51,509
PROSECUTION

793
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:55,972
Han Joon-hwi did not know
that what he wrote in the petition

794
00:46:56,055 --> 00:46:58,224
was based on false information.

795
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:01,811
<i>Since Mr. Seo Byung-ju was appointed</i>
<i>as a professor</i>

796
00:47:01,894 --> 00:47:03,563
<i>right after making the donation,</i>

797
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:05,648
<i>the suspicion was reasonable.</i>

798
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:09,652
He approached Mr. Seo directly
to verify the suspicion,

799
00:47:09,735 --> 00:47:13,656
and Mr. Seo told him to think
however he wanted

800
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,658
instead of denying it.

801
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:20,955
That was because his question
wasn't worth answering.

802
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,541
He's smart enough to have understood
what Mr. Seo meant.

803
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:26,460
And also because Mr. Seo

804
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:29,213
is his uncle.

805
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:37,471
He was not able to submit any evidence

806
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,974
to prove that his allegation
was founded on facts.

807
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:44,604
You think that smart guy actually
believed such an unfounded suspicion?

808
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,231
If he knew it wasn't true,
why did he put up--

809
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:49,984
He laid down a smoke screen
because he was afraid

810
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,237
that his admission might seem to be
related to the donation.

811
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:56,657
I could've used such help,
but he didn't need to go that route

812
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:59,035
as he passed the second round
of the judicial exam.

813
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,539
If I were the dean,
I'd want to pay him to join the school.

814
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,543
Had he known that it wasn't true,

815
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:11,130
he wouldn't have put up a petition
attacking his dear uncle.

816
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:13,382
Even urging people to sign it.

817
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,386
He did it even though it pained him
because he believed it was true.

818
00:48:18,012 --> 00:48:19,931
For the sake of justice
and for his uncle--

819
00:48:20,014 --> 00:48:21,224
Thank you.

820
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:24,352
-I still--
-Now, from the prosecutor's perspective.

821
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,355
-Pardon? Professor, I--
-Ji-ho, you be the defense attorney.

822
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,693
He's putting his specialty to use.

823
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,993
Why on earth did Joon-hwi

824
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:44,538
put up such a petition
that attacks his dear uncle?

825
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,123
Goodness.

826
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:49,210
Seeing his uncle trying to
evade responsibility made him believe

827
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,712
-his suspicion was true.
-He was attacking him.

828
00:48:52,338 --> 00:48:53,923
He's dissing himself now.

829
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:56,217
Even though it pained him,

830
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:58,970
for the sake of justice and for his uncle,

831
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:01,222
he made that decision.

832
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:02,640
Unbelievable.

833
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:04,558
He's reversing his own argument.

834
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:05,935
He can't be trusted.

835
00:49:09,021 --> 00:49:09,855
THE ACCUSED

836
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:11,023
Prosecution.

837
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,192
I think…

838
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,321
Joon-hwi…

839
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,074
Even though he knew it was not true,

840
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,161
because of his personal grudge
against Mr. Seo…

841
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,043
I'm sorry.

842
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:34,964
You can do it.

843
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:37,967
No, I can't.

844
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,348
The prosecution gave up,

845
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,851
so Joon-hwi won.

846
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:50,313
The school will drop the case then.

847
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:52,356
-What?
-Seriously?

848
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:53,899
For real?

849
00:49:53,983 --> 00:49:54,859
What the…

850
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:56,402
What's going on?

851
00:49:58,112 --> 00:49:59,530
<i>Was her name Kang Sol?</i>

852
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:06,287
When I saw her sitting there
looking dazed and confused…

853
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,623
She's like you in your younger days?

854
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:11,459
You cried, saying you couldn't do it.

855
00:50:14,503 --> 00:50:16,714
When I was told to attack my own argument…

856
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:19,550
Gosh, I hated it so much.

857
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,054
So, I became a judge instead of a lawyer.

858
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:25,931
Anyway, I'm sure the kids in their 1L year

859
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:29,226
now fully understand defamation
thanks to your little show.

860
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:34,106
Without it, the president
wouldn't have let him go unpunished.

861
00:50:35,524 --> 00:50:37,526
Our plan totally worked.

862
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,903
"Our plan"?

863
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:42,990
At the entrance ceremony,

864
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:46,160
you said you'd do anything
for the students.

865
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,371
Yes, I did.

866
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:51,290
Did you see the petition on the board?

867
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:52,917
"Petition"?

868
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,296
How about we put on
a little show together for the students?

869
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:04,303
Let's visit him together.

00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,306
Professor.

882
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,434
-Are you okay?
-The verdict?

883
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:52,935
Pardon me?

884
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:54,895
Guilty of the murder?

885
00:51:55,563 --> 00:51:57,189
What do you mean?

886
00:51:58,941 --> 00:51:59,942
I've been acquitted.

887
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:03,988
They couldn't prove it
beyond a reasonable doubt.

888
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,366
Oh, the mock trial.

889
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:10,202
I wanted to pronounce him guilty,

890
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:11,954
but because of the reasonable doubt…

891
00:52:12,037 --> 00:52:13,372
So, he was found not guilty.

892
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:15,708
So, you didn't kill her.

893
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:16,876
I did.

894
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:17,793
What?

895
00:52:19,378 --> 00:52:21,005
The lack of evidence saved me.

896
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:24,008
What? So my hunch was right?

897
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,093
You said you didn't kill the victim.

898
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:28,554
I was the judge. I let a murderer go?

899
00:52:28,637 --> 00:52:29,889
I can't believe this.

900
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:31,682
Darn it.

901
00:52:32,975 --> 00:52:33,851
What about you?

902
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,190
Did you kill him?

903
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:45,070
My gosh, please have a look.

904
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:45,988
Thank you.

905
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:48,115
Please have a look. Hello!

906
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,366
We just opened.

907
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,284

Will you cooperate
with the on-site inspection?

930
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:03,015
Seo struck a deal with Lee Man-ho
to cover up the hit-and-run.

931
00:54:03,098 --> 00:54:04,516
Was that your motive?

932

DO NOT ENTER

939
00:54:56,985 --> 00:55:00,405
Hey. How come they're considered
witnesses and we aren't?

940
00:55:00,489 --> 00:55:02,824
Seung-jae wasn't here
at the time of the murder,

941
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:04,660
and I was nowhere near that room.

942
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:06,328
You want to be there?

943
00:55:07,162 --> 00:55:08,997
-Yeah.
-You could be seen as a suspect.

944
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:12,668
Isn't Joon-hwi there
as the victim's family?

945
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:14,836
Oh, maybe.

946
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,754
You can't do that!

947
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:16,880
-What?
-Just a moment.

948
00:55:16,964 --> 00:55:17,881
-Get out.
-Wait.

949
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:19,508
Get out. You cannot come in here.

950
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:23,178
Let's start in the media room.
This way, please.

951
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:39,736
Mr. Seo wanted to take an early break
on the day of the incident

952
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,655
because of a headache?

953
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:43,699
Correct.

954
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:47,202
2P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE MURDER

955
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:48,662
Let's take a 30-minute break.

956
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:02,342
Are you all right?

957
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,178
If you're tired, we can just wrap up here.

958
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:08,557
I took headache pills, so I'll be fine.

959
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,684
Okay.

960
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,853
Professor Kim.

961
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:16,690
I know you're holding back

962
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,485
many things you want to say to me.

963
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,948
You do? What a shame.

964
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,410
I kept quiet assuming you didn't know.

965
00:56:32,497 --> 00:56:34,666
When you were a prosecutor,

966
00:56:35,584 --> 00:56:38,003
you made Jong-hoon
leave the Prosecution Service

967
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:40,672
and made me quit being a judge as well.

968
00:56:47,262 --> 00:56:49,181
<i>Seo walked out of the room,</i>

969
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:54,019
<i>sat on the stairs,</i>
<i>and put methamphetamine into his coffee.</i>

970
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:56,980
Right at that moment,

971
00:56:57,564 --> 00:57:01,026
Yang walked down the stairs…

972
00:57:06,782 --> 00:57:08,575
and said this to Seo.

973
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:10,494
What are you doing?

974
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:19,753
A former chief prosecutor doing drugs?

975
00:57:22,297 --> 00:57:25,467
Right, you must've been high
when you sent the video.

976
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:32,349
<i>I was confessing to you.</i>

977
00:57:37,562 --> 00:57:38,480
WAITING ROOM

978
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:42,943
Turn yourself in…

979
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:45,278
to the police.

980
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,160
I'm confessing to you.

981
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,788
Don't you get it?

982
00:57:57,499 --> 00:57:59,126
If you forgive me…

983
00:58:00,585 --> 00:58:01,628
Forgive you?

984
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:04,464
You want to be forgiven?

985
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:07,008
Yes.

986
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:14,057
I've suffered enough.

987
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:20,147
Then,

988
00:58:22,023 --> 00:58:23,817
I should forgive you.

989
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,404
<i>Feeling the urge to kill Seo</i>
<i>in that moment,</i>

990
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:30,323
<i>Yang poured the entire sachet</i>
<i>of meth into the coffee.</i>

991
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,075
It was sugar, not meth.

992
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:36,371
Stop writing a novel.

993
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,421
<i>After I dumped his methamphetamine</i>

994
00:58:44,504 --> 00:58:45,964
<i>-in the sink,</i>
-No!

995
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:50,260
<i>he went into hypoglycemic shock.</i>

996
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:53,847
He passed out from hypoglycemia,

997
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,474
so I gave him coffee with sugar.

998
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:14,451
It fell out of the glasses?

999
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:17,579
He rolled down the stairs?

1000
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,333
Detective Oh.

1001
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:23,043
Check the glasses Seo was wearing.

1002
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:24,878
Yes, sir.

1003
00:59:54,866 --> 00:59:57,744
Did you kill him?

1004
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:02,040
No.

1005
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:06,294
You didn't do it, right?

1006
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:07,921
I knew it.

1007
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:10,048
Then who…

1008
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,342
Who did it?

1009
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,320
It was you?

1010
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:40,745
