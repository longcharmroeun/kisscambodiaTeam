OCTOBER 2020, PRESENT

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,178
Prosecution, continue your questioning.

11
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,348
-Witness.
-Yes.

12
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,267
Do you regret obtaining pentobarbital,
a euthanasia drug,

13
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,685
per the defendant's request?

14
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:11,603
I do.

15
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,105
I wouldn't have obtained it

16
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:18,652
if I knew he wanted to kill a person
instead of a terminally ill dog.

17
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,695
That's all.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,782
Counsel, cross-examine.

00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:27,786
YEONJU-DONG DRUG POISONING MURDER CASE

20
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,378
Witness,
you're the defendant's university friend,

21
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:37,963
who's running an animal clinic.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,715
We're alumni, but he changed his major--

23
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,133
Please answer yes or no.

24
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,053
Yes.

25
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,765
The defendant changed his major
and is in Dental School.

26
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:52,519
Can't he easily get his hands on drugs
such as ketamine or propofol?

27
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:55,188
Objection. It's a leading question.

28
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:57,941
Didn't you know
it's allowed in cross-examination?

29
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,077
Please answer yes or no.

30
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,537
He can obtain it, can't he?

31
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,873
Yes.

32
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,709
If he was going to kill a person,

33
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,545
why would he have asked the witness,
who's a veterinarian,

34
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,255
to obtain the euthanasia drug?

35
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:21,673
-I think--
-That's unnecessary

36
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,175
from a man
who was jealous of the defendant.

37
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,761
-Objection!
-The witness cannot make an objection.

38
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:31,266
The defendant only wanted to euthanize
his terminally ill pet dog.

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,936
<i>And the witness was well aware of that.</i>

40
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,354
Objection.

41
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:38,606
The counsel is humiliating the witness.

42
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,108
-Sustain--
-I admit.

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,195
Stating the witness had a crush

44
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,239
and was jealous of the defendant

45
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,950
could lead to an impression
his testimony is false,

46
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,535
so I withdraw the statement.

47
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:53,079
-Objection.
-That's all.

49

A MONUMENT
FOR ALUMNUS SEO BYUNG-JU'S DEDICATION

52
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:34,788
You shouldn't lead him on that much.

53
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,623
Do you know why the counsel is allowed

54
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:39,125
to lead the witness
during the cross-examination?

55
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,627
It's saying we can go all out.

56
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,297
To destroy the prosecutor's argument.

57
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,133
I shouldn't do that much? My ass.

58
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,178
Sorry.

59
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:52,639
I got summoned as a witness
for the prosecution,

60
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:54,682
but I only did her good.

61
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,437
I really hate you.

62
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:01,898
Not me, right?

63
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:04,651
What can I do?
I was only allowed to answer yes or no.

64
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,654
Should I have pleaded the Fifth?

65
00:05:07,737 --> 00:05:08,988
The Fifth is there

66
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:12,867
for the defendant to use, not the witness.

67
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:15,036
What? Why were you there?

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,247
If the witness wants to refuse to testify…

69
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,792
use the right to refuse to testify.

70
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,586
How dare a defendant jump on the bench.

71
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,298
It's not for a judge who's wearing pajamas
under the bench to say.

72
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,469
How dare you say that to the judge.
I'll punish you for insulting the--

73
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,804
Not insulting. Contempt.

74
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:36,224
-Criminal Code?
-Article 138?

75
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,435
Precisely.

76
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,436
Darn it.

77
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:43,773
Anyway, if we're told to answer
only yes or no, do we have to?

78
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:45,900
No, you don't have to.

79
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,361
What? I didn't have to answer yes or no?

80
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,487
I said yes for nothing.

81
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,572
Exactly.

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,169
The break is getting too long.

83
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,795
Did Professor Seo fall asleep?

84
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:08,923
Shouldn't we go find him?

85
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:10,884
Please do that, guard.

86
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:13,261
Yes, Your Honor.

Professor Seo?

90
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,695
Professor Seo, the break is over.

91
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,410
Professor, are you asleep?

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,831
Professor?

YEONJU-DONG DRUG POISONING MURDER CASE

94
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,090
Hello.

95
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,805
We had no idea.

96
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,848
-We were all here.
-Everyone was here.

97
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:00,618
Prosecutor Yang.

98
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,142
KCSI

99
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:29,564
50 TEST STRIPS, 1 BOTTLE

100
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:00,720
GREEN TEA

101
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,601
I found this in the victim's inner pocket.

102
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:50,144
It must be suicide.

103
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:52,021
I'M SICK OF LIVING THIS LIFE

104
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,606
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

105
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,819
Someone who wanted to take his life today
won't need

106
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,737
those blood sugar test strips delivered.

107
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,741
Yes, you're right.

108
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,661
MR. SEO, 50 TEST STRIPS, 1 BOTTLE

109
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,134
He's a prosecutor I used to work with,

110
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:22,677
a professor at this law school.

111
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:25,304
Professor Yang Jong-hoon.

112
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,477
MARCH 2020

113
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:33,312
Yang Jong-hoon, the Criminal Code.

114
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,735
Case number 2017D4114.

115
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:42,488
Kim Cheol-su and Lee Yeong-hui made
a sex tape under consent in an affair.

116
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:43,906
When Lee wanted to leave,

117
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,075
Kim filmed the said video on his phone

118
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,494
then sent the recorded video
to Lee's husband.

119
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,621
The first and second trials
found him guilty,

120
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,457
but the Supreme Court acquitted him.

121
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,041
What's the key issue here?

122
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:05,928
The high bun.

123
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:19,150
I don't think anyone in here
has a high bun.

124
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:24,405
The main issue was Article 14
of the Act on Punishment of Sexual Crimes.

125
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:27,575
It punishes those who use cameras
to film other people's body

126
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:30,119
or distribute the photograph or video.

127
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:33,122
The key issue was if the word "body"
should be taken literally.

128
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,043
The first and second trials
pronounced him as guilty,

129
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,545
interpreting the image of a body
as a person's body.

130
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,255
But the Supreme Court disagreed

131
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,548
and found him innocent.

132
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:48,596
If you film someone's body directly,
you're guilty.

133
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,100
But it's not a crime
to take a photo of this.

134
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:58,481
-If you were the judge?
-I'm with the Supreme Court.

135
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,900
Criminal punishment
abides by principle of legality.

136
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,568
We must stay away from inference.

137
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:03,528
That's not right.

138
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:09,617
When we extend the interpretation
of a body to photos and videos of someone,

139
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,786
kissing this fellow student on the lips

140
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:14,205
would be considered the same
as kissing her photo.

141
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:15,665
That's not right.

142
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,001
So it wasn't a narrow interpretation?

143
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,296
When it comes to the misapplication
or people's emotional acceptance,

144
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,924
the law has been amended
to include a person's body

145
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,635
as well as the re-recording
of someone's photo

146
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:28,594
in the year 2018.

147
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:31,472
The law was the issue,
not the interpretation.

148
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:32,849
Legislation is the solution.

149
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:35,977
Second-round judicial exam?

150
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:38,729
Second-round judicial exam?

151
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,606
I heard one of the freshmen passed it.

152
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:42,400
That's amazing.

153
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:44,527
Yes, I'm Han Joon-hwi.

154
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,404
If you want me to remember you,

155
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:49,532
you better not take away
other students' chance to answer anymore.

156
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,871
Choi Mi-yeong, a drug offender, sued

157
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,747
Kim Min-su, the prosecutor, for rape.

158
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,750
After the investigation,
he wasn't indicted for rape but bribery

159
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:02,086
and the Supreme Court found him guilty.

160
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:05,590
The high bun from two minutes
and ten seconds ago, what's the issue?

161
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,759
Sorry? Right. It's…

162
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:13,389
He was indicted for bribery
and not rape because…

163
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,187
-I tried to come prepared--
-The issue?

164
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:21,939
The issue is, well…

165
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,316
So the issue is?

166
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,817
We don't know if he raped her.

167
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,861
We don't know, or was it not rape?

168
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,906
-Sorry? Right, it doesn't look like rape.
-Doesn't look like rape?

169
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,075
Will your decision say, "He seems guilty"?

170
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,578
You'd answer that if you came prepared.

171
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,165
It wasn't rape.

172
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,000
If it was bribery, what about Choi?

173
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,293
Choi Mi-yeong was…

174
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,296
I'm not sure what you're asking.

175
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:46,339
Kang Sol B.

176
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:49,258
If it's a rape case,
Choi Mi-yeong would be a victim.

177
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:51,469
But if it's bribery,
she'd be accused, too.

178
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:55,056
Choi became a suspect
because sex was considered as a bribe.

179
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,098
And the key issue?

180
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,767
Is sex considered as a bribe?

181
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,268
Why did the court say yes?

182
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:01,771
-The essence of the bribe--
-Kang Sol A.

183
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,064
Me?

184
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,899
Well, it's…

185
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,401
Since some people pay money
to have intercourse,

186
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,904
she bribed him with sex, not money--

187
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,073
So sex can be turned into monetary value,

188
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:14,158
acknowledging commercialization of sex?

189
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:16,160
-No, that's not what I meant.
-Then what?

190
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:18,204
It's not that
the court commercialized sex.

191
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,538
Then what?

192
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:23,250
-I'm sorry. My mind went blank--
-Kang Sol B.

193
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,378
The court considered
the benefit of bribery

194
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,463
not only as monetary or property gain

195
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:29,465
but anything tangible and intangible

196
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:32,134
that can satisfy
the demand and desire of a human.

197
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,595
It considered
sexual benefit through intercourse

198
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,930
as an intangible benefit.

199
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:37,014
Kang Sol A.

200
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,351
Why did the court acknowledge sex
as a bribe?

201
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:43,354
Kang Sol B just told you--

202
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:46,190
Kang Sol A,
I'm waiting to hear an answer from you!

203
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:50,987
Then what's bribery?

204
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,907
Bribery is
when civil servants receive money--

205
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:56,158
Only money?

206
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:59,370
And sexual acts.
Intangible benefit such as sexual acts--

207
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,621
And the elements are?

208
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:03,541
Relations to duty and--

209
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:12,341
Tell me now.

210
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:14,844
What's bribery?

211
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,349
-Professor.
-What is it?

212
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,853
Is there any kind of answer you can give?

213
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:24,770
I feel suffocated.

214
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,355
She might get a cardiac arrest.

215
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,027
What I can answer confidently is…

216
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,155
the circumstances precluding

217
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:35,406
-wrongfulness--
-The five.

218
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:36,490
JUSTIFICATION

219
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:38,784
Justifiable act, self-defense,

220
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:41,245
emergency evacuation, victim's consent,

221
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,872
and self-comfort.

222
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:45,416
"Self-comfort"?

223
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,377
When did it get into the Criminal Code?

224
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,254
Silence!

225
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm sorry. It wasn't self-comfort.
I meant self-help.

226
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,594
-Then what's self-help?
-I don't…

227
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,472
-I can't do it.
-You give up on the class?

228
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:01,891
No, sir.
I wish to take part in this class.

229
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:03,642
But answering this--

230
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:06,729
If you give up on answering this,
you give up on this lecture.

231
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,403
Self-help can be claimed
when the legal procedure

232
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:18,157
prevents you from preserving
your right to file a claim…

233
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,450
You can't even read?

234
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,078
to turn the right of claim infeasible…

235
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,460
or to avoid difficulty
in carrying out the…

236
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,213
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,429
Let's take ten.

238
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,571
I thought you wanted an apology.

239
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,245
You said you wanted to learn from me.

240
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,414
<i>Number 8003, Kang Sol.</i>

241
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,168
Yes, I'm number 8003, Kang Sol.

242
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:12,837
Why did you come to law school?

243
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,963
To receive an apology.

244
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:16,090
An apology?

245
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:19,844
The law owes me a bit of,
no, a huge apology.

246
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,304
You want the law to apologize?

247
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:26,684
I got sued for assault
while trying to save someone.

248
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:28,227
It was very unfair.

249
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,147
I tried to get a lawyer
to claim self-defense,

250
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,731
but that cost three million won.

251
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,443
I tried to fight it alone,
but the fine was two million won.

252
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,696
I choked down my tears
and settled the case.

253
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,907
Because a million won of settlement
was my cheapest way out.

254
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:43,826
And that money

255
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,871
was my entire fortune that
I worked hard for and saved for years.

256
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,541
The law shouldn't have done this to me.

257
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:56,046
Becoming a lawyer was the only way
a poor kid like me could have justice.

258
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,215
And this special admission

259
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,759
was the only way
a poor kid could become a lawyer.

260
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,428
That's why I applied.

261
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:06,432
Okay. How do you expect
to have the law apologize to you?

262
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:10,436
That's for you to teach me, professor.

263
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:20,988
Will you still give up?

264
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,826
I didn't think it through. I'm sorry.

265
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,244
I don't want your apology.

266
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,997
Don't do anything to be sorry for.

267
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:33,417
We don't have much time left.

268
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,675
LECTURE HALL

269
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,178
Are you all right?

270
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:46,180
I deleted the photos--

271
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,390
Second-round judicial exam, save my life.

272
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,475
What?

273
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:59,944
Do you think Socrates knew

274
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:01,654
that in the future,

275
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:05,157
his teaching method would throw us
into this state of terror?

276
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:09,245
Han Joon-hwi and Kang Sol B
didn't look scared.

277
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:10,537
They seemed to enjoy this.

278
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:13,040
If Joon-hwi passed the second round,
why is he here?

279
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:15,000
No one gets dropped out at the interview.

280
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,293
Jealousy equals defeat,

281
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:19,171
but I'm jealous of LLB students
and judicial exam examinees.

282
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:21,757
You passed the first round,
and you went to med school.

283
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,635
I'm a complete newbie. This is so wrong.

284
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,805
Newbies like us
have a totally different starting line.

285
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:29,556
How can we race with you?

286
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,059
But we all pee in our pants
during the Criminal Code.

287
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm too scared to take a dump.

288
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:35,062
Hey, what are you doing?

289
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:38,899
You know, that girl. Kang Sol A?
I'm jealous of her resiliency.

290
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,359
How does she survive that?

291
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,237
"When did self-comfort
get into the Criminal Code?"

292
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,530
I'm about to puke.

293
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:45,531
"Answer me."

294
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,951
"You give up on answering,
you give up on this lecture."

295
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:55,624
-Again, I bet another student got scared…
<i>-Seo was indicted for bribery for the land</i>

<i>and said they'll have a donation ceremony.</i>

306
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:21,400
You had to step down as a prosecutor

307
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:22,693
If it were a bribe--

308
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,486
Instead, I got another goal.

309
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:27,656
Even if I don't make
any great judicial officers,

310
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,284
I'm not going to turn anyone
into a delinquent.

00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:23,939
isn't just rape but an attempted murder.

352
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:27,234
He's a heinous criminal
as evil as a serial murderer.

353
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,612
He committed a crime
on a girl young enough to be his own

354
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,197
but didn't regret his acts.

355
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:35,367
Considering the long-term effects
the victim must live with,

356
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,203
I believe Lee Man-ho
should never be released.

BRIBERY OF CHIEF PROESECUTOR SEO

366
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:18,285
Case number 2017D2531.

367
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:19,620
A bribery case.

368
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,372
Chief Prosecutor Seo
was indicted for bribery

369
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:25,042
for receiving land worth 370 million
from Assemblyman Ko.

370
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,711
First trial, not guilty.
Second trial, guilty.

371
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:33,967
The Supreme Court sent the case back
and found him innocent,

372
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,802
and the case was finalized.

373
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,638
What's the issue here?

374
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:40,474
Should the free land Seo received…

375
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,769
be considered as a bribe

376
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:46,104
or a gift?

377
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,529
You're teaching my case during class.

378
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:56,406
What an honor.

379
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:03,080
The Supreme Court said it wasn't a bribe.

380
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,706
What's the reason?

381
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:09,044
Because the relations to my duty
and the quid pro quo wasn't proven.

382
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:13,173
Are you claiming the land that became
5.6 billion from 370 million won

383
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:15,384
was a gift, not a bribe?

384
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:18,554
It was a gift
that could be mistaken as a bribe.

385
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:19,555
KO, ASSEMBLYMAN

386
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,057
It was a gift I probably…

SEO BYUNG-JU, CHIEF PROSECUTOR

388
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,143
shouldn't have taken.

389
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:27,145
A gift?

390
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:29,481
It was 370 million won.

391
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,733
A gift of such a high value isn't normal.

392
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,235
They were close friends.

393
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:35,320
"Close friends"?

394
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:42,035
As the written judgment stated,
Seo was a close friend to Ko,

395
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,454
so close that they knew
everything about each other.

396
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,165
If you knew everything about each other,

397
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,627
I'm sure you knew what Ko Hyeong-su wanted
when he gave you that land.

398
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,673
His ulterior motive of wanting your help
as the chief prosecutor

399
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:55,841
if he got in trouble.

400
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:02,180
If you accepted this land
knowing his ulterior motive,

401
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:04,975
we can't say it wasn't a quid pro quo
he gave as insurance.

402
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,144
It's a violation of the ban

403
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,228
on bribing officials…

404
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:10,647
To carry out his or her duty
for personal gain.

405
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:15,861
So he bribed me as insurance?

406
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:17,696
You're right.

407
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:22,451
You didn't read the decision right.

408
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:26,079
You should've read it thoroughly
for my sake

409
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,664
since I left over this case.

410
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,460
Seo Ji-ho.

411
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,503
Will you tell us?

412
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,465
It looks like
you read the decision thoroughly.

413
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:40,761
An expectation of help in the future
isn't a quid pro quo.

414
00:25:41,303 --> 00:25:43,805
Bribing someone as insurance
isn't considered bribery.

415
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:46,725
And the non-bribery
will be used for your benefit.

416
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:50,020
What a relief.

417
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,365
What an interesting class.

418
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:22,511
I heard you're called
the Yangcrates of Terror.

419
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:32,521
Professor Yang Jong-hoon
is pretty memorable.

420
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:36,525
But still, you belong in the prosecution.

421
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:39,069
Go back.

422
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:41,905
Yang Jong-hoon

423
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:44,282
is a born prosecutor.

424
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:46,618
I would've been so,

425
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:50,831
if only I didn't let Chief Prosecutor Seo
get the best of me.

426
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:56,586
Are you saying you're here now

427
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,131
because of me?

428
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:05,387
We'll say it's thanks to you.

429
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:26,074
RESTRICTED NUMBER

430
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,160
RESTRICTED NUMBER

431
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:36,251
If he really was murdered,

432
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:38,253
the culprit would've used that door.

433
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,465
So there are no CCTVs.

434
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:43,759
That's an entrance only for professors,

435
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,469
opened by fingerprint recognition.

436
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:48,430
So they walked through the court
and got there.

437
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:49,890
This screen is also missing

438
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:52,768
the hallway into the waiting room
from the court.

439
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:57,355
That means we cannot confirm
who came in and out of that room.

440
00:27:57,439 --> 00:28:00,233
You'll get an idea
once you take the footprints.

441
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:08,283
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

442
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:10,285
Out of batteries?

443
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:12,037
I'll charge it now.

444
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:18,168
He's trying it out for his class.

445
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,799
If he was murdered,
do you have any suspects?

446
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:26,051
Me.

447
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:37,479
There is one more person
I'm suspicious of.

448
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:41,483
-Did it really happen?
-Say something!

449
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,567
Is it true?

450
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,110
-Wait!
-Over here!

451
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:45,028
Excuse me!

452
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:46,279
-Let me in!
-Stay back.

453
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:47,906
Was this really a murder case?

454
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:49,115
-Over here!
-Wait!

455
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,623
REPORTER JANG NAM-CHEOL

456
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:07,509
A murder case on our campus?

457
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:10,428
The donation was already controversial,

458
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:13,098
and this happened at the mock court
made with that money.

459
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:14,975
What did the police say?

460
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,436
They can't say he was murdered yet.

461
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,272
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:24,818
They're waiting for the autopsy result
to see if he was murdered.

463
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:26,778
I hope it's not a murder case.

464
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:29,906
"Law School Murder Case"
is already trending online.

465
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,535
I doubt it's a suicide.

466
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:35,704
He has been after

467
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:38,331
the directorship of the Legal Clinic
until few days ago.

468
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:40,792
A video of the crime scene
went viral, too.

469
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:46,006
How did Hankuk University Law School
end up in this situation?

470
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:50,802
The school will not make any statements
regarding this case.

471
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:55,098
Please stay away from the media,
and tell your students to keep quiet.

472
00:29:56,975 --> 00:30:00,562
To help them be less stressed or confused
and stay away from this case,

473
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:02,647
can we move up the midterm--

474
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:03,607
There's no need.

475
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:13,366
This meeting is stressful and confusing.

476
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,786
I'm sure the library is completely fine.

477
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,732
How can we go on
as if nothing had happened?

478
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:48,193
Didn't something awful
happen to Professor Seo?

479
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,128
-Come on.
-My gosh.

480
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:16,846
<i>Former chief prosecutor Seo died</i>

How can we be fine
while people out there are in a ruckus?

488
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:34,239
Everyone just sits and studies.

489
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:36,574
What will you do if you don't study?

490
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:39,285
If you don't pass the Bar exam,
it'll ruin your life.

491
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:42,455
Only half of you will pass the exam.
This is war.

492
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,623
"You die, I live."

493
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:45,417
But it's not like he's a stranger.

494
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,585
He was there a second ago.

495
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:50,338
How can everyone be so cold?

496
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,341
Those psychopaths. Cold-blooded jerks.

497
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,554
You should be a psychopath
if that'll help you pass.

<i>The police believe he could've been killed</i>

499

<i>-to find the cause of death.</i>
-Murder?

501
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,106
Forget it even if it's a serial murder,
not just a regular murder.

502
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:09,315
One more probation

503
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,861
and you'll have to pay them,
the poor people scholarship you got.

504
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:15,697
You have enough trouble.

505
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:18,491

But still, this is a murder case.

508
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:25,707
Go get murdered by your books.
Run along. Go. Go!

509
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:30,795
If he was murdered,
then who on earth is the culprit?

510
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,766
"You'll end up like me."
Hang it on your wall.

00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,688
<i>Former chief prosecutor Seo</i>
<i>died at Hankuk University</i>

527
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:37,774
<i>where he taught as an adjunct professor.</i>

528
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:40,235
<i>The police believe he could've been killed</i>

529
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:43,613
<i>and will do an autopsy</i>
<i>to find the cause of death.</i>

530
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:46,866
<i>We confirmed that Seo,</i>
<i>the former chief prosecutor,</i>

531
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,869
<i>was teaching a mock trial</i>
<i>at the time of his death.</i>

532
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:54,165
<i>Ironically, the new mock court</i>
<i>where Seo was found dead</i>

533
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:58,670
<i>was established with the donation</i>
<i>he made to the university,</i>

534
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:00,255
<i>making more people feel sorry.</i>

535
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,842
<i>Seo's body was first found</i>
<i>by one of the law school students.</i>

536
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,303
<i>The police will do an autopsy to find…</i>

537
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:08,221
Is anyone home?

538
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:09,597
<i>the cause of his death.</i>

539
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,400
Mr. Lee Man-ho?

540
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,795
The people became highly interested
as Lee got released.

541
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:43,715
The top three percent
who are most likely to relapse

542
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,675
are kept under special control.

543
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:47,635
And Lee Man-ho is one of them, right?

544
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,263
Yes. Take a look at his location.

545
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,807
Look. Do you see that?

546
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,811
EUNPYEONG-GU, SEODAEMUN-GU

547
00:36:56,894 --> 00:36:58,062
GANGNAM-GU

548
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:08,323
MARCH, 2020

549
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,542
Where's the lecture hall
for the Civil Code class?

550
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:24,630
I'd like to thank all of you
who took your precious time out

551
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:28,301
to come and take this Civil Code class
I, Kim Eun-suk, teach.

552
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:33,014
I really dread the Civil Code.

553
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:37,268
I'm disgusted and appalled
by the Civil Code.

554
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:40,980
If anyone asks, "Will you read
the Civil Code or be pregnant?"

555
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:42,231
I'd rather get pregnant.

556
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,526
Then why do you--

557
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,528
Why do I teach the Civil Code, Min Bok-gi?

558
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:49,072
How do you know my name?

559
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:52,575
THE CIVIL CODE

560
00:37:53,368 --> 00:37:55,453
Chae-eun, Hyo-i, I-han, Dong-seong,

561
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:57,580
Chae-yeong, Mun-cheol,
Jeong-cheol, Yeong-jun.

562
00:37:57,663 --> 00:37:58,623
-No chart.
-Gyu-cheol,

563
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:00,124
U-ri, Ga-yeong, Tae-jun,

564
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,251
Yeong-nam, Ye-beom, Bok-gi, Seung-jae,

565
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:04,337
Hye-jin, Jin-hyeok, Seong-a, A-yeong,

566
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,838
Ye-seul, Sol A, Joon-hwi,

567
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:08,091
Ji-ho, Sol B, Su-a, Wan-jun, Jong-hyeon,

568
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:10,259
Gwang-hui, Ju-hyeon, Min-jeong, Gyun-hong,

569
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:12,929
In-hyeon, Su-bin, A-hyeon, Hye-jin,

570
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:15,098
Gyeong-won, Hong-mo, A-reum.

571
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:19,435
And stop Photoshopping, Ju-a.

572
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,436
You're pretty.

573
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,113
I wanted to make sure you become students

574
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:32,657
who don't despise the Civil Code
as much as I did.

575
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,452
That means my class will be
more interesting than anything,

576
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:38,621
and you'll get so much out of it.

577
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:44,419
That Socratic method can go kill itself!

578
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:50,633
Then let us begin this fun class.

579
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:51,551
Now,

580
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,302
party A

581
00:38:53,386 --> 00:38:57,598
sold a land worth 100 million won
to his close friend, party B.

582
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:03,980
I mean, if they're so close,
why couldn't he just give it as a gift?

583
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,816
Why did he take money
only to give us so much headache?

584
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:08,401
It's insane to give it away.

585
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:10,486
Yes, he's a nutcase.

586
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,905
My gosh. Goodness, sorry.

587
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,240
Forget I said "nutcase."

588
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:19,454
Now, party A received 95 million won
until the due date

589
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:21,747
and never got
the balance of 5 million won.

590
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:23,666
He claimed the contract is canceled,

591
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:26,794
and that he won't give back
the 95 million won he got.

592
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,421
He sounds more like a thief.

593
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:30,715
"He sounds more like a thief"?
Who said that?

594
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,136
I did.

595
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,056
-Sorry, I couldn't help it.
-It's the core issue.

596
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,268
Article Two, Trust and Good Faith, is made

597
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:44,353
so people's rights
must be exercised humanely

598
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:45,855
with trust and good faith,

599
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:47,565
within people's common sense.

600
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:50,067
It means we shouldn't be like a thief.

601
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,199
That just made so much sense!

602
00:39:57,283 --> 00:39:58,826
Kang Sol A and Han Joon-hwi,

603
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,162
come hand-in-hand to my office
within this week.

604
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:06,000
I'll give you a chance to hit it off
while you clean every corner of my office.

605
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:11,214
Then let's discuss
this thief-like attitude a little more.

606
00:40:11,297 --> 00:40:13,049
Do you think I'm like a thief, too?

607
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,200
Defendant, I'll give you one last chance.

608
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:42,578
While you committed

609
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:46,874
a heinous act of crime
against this young victim,

610
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,128
you received a phone call
from your young son.

611
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,215
I do not remember.

612
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:59,512
When your son asked what you were up to,

613
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:03,849
you should've stopped
your atrocious action then and there.

614
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,728
I was too drunk back then,

615
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:09,564
so I don't remember a thing.

616
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:10,481
Man.

617
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,442
This is driving me crazy.

618
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,070
It's the booze.

619
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:19,031
If it hadn't been for the booze.
Darn it, booze.

620
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:24,662
Well, I guess I regret that I got drunk.

621
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:26,622
You regret it, yet you lodged an appeal?

622
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:29,375
How can you laugh right now?

623
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:36,173
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

624
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,383
DEFENDANT: LEE MAN-HO

625
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,676
PROSECUTOR: SEO BYUNG-JU

626
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:44,056
The prosecution made no appeal.

627
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,727
It's deplorable that I cannot go above
the original sentencing.

628
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,895
As a judge, I am devastated

629
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:53,024
that I have no choice
but to reduce his sentencing

630
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,152
according to Article 10-2
of the Criminal Code.

631
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,490
Sentencing.

632
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:05,620
Article 10-2 of the Criminal Code.

633
00:42:06,495 --> 00:42:08,080
"For the conduct of a person

634
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:11,709
who is unable to make discriminations
or to control one's will,

635
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:15,796
the punishment is mitigated."

636
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:19,550
This clause

637
00:42:20,426 --> 00:42:23,638
will always torment my heart.

638
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:27,224
You asshole!

639
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:35,441
Article 10-2 of the Criminal Code,
the Lee Man-ho Act.

640
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:41,030
Thanks to me, instead of forcefully
mitigating the punishment,

641
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:44,367
it was amended
so the judge may or may not do that.

642
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,827
The Act was even amended.

643
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:50,373
Why did you quit working as a judge?

644
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,795
What are you doing here?

645
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:04,929
Eleven years ago,
you called me an asshole, judge.

646
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:06,263
You must be relieved that

647
00:43:06,347 --> 00:43:09,308
the criminal statutory limitations
and civil statute of limitations

648
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:10,518
have expired.

649
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,064
But I'll make sure these people
who are within the statutory limitations

650
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:17,233
will be punished.

651
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:18,818
I'll file for compensation, too.

652
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:21,529
Look, that's not an attitude of a thief,
is it?

653
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:24,156
The bitterness of the law.

654
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,786
I heard the Legal Clinic here

655
00:43:29,412 --> 00:43:31,706
provides free legal consultations.

656
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:34,875
Please help me out, Professor Kim Eun-suk.

657
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:41,298
-What's he saying?
-He'll sue people who wrote hate comments?

658
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:45,386
This is

659
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:48,055
a sacred classroom.

660
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:54,520
These malicious comments are very evil.

661
00:43:56,439 --> 00:44:00,192
Let's say I get 500,000 won per person
as compensation.

662
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:03,112
I'd be sitting on a pile of money.

663
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:04,113
If you help me out,

664
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,616
I'll consider making a donation here.

665
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,704
If they wish, I'll also give
some compensation for my victim.

666
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,294
What? Compensation?

667
00:44:19,587 --> 00:44:21,881
I guess she might not need that.

668
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:22,923
Figures.

669
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:27,720
I already paid for my crime
according to the state's sentencing.

670
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:29,972
Hey.

671
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:34,935
Why the heck
should I be treated like this?

672
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,773
It's not like I'm a serial killer.

673
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:41,650
I was drunk! I don't remember a thing.

674
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:44,820
But 11 years.
I rot in prison for 11 years.

675
00:44:44,904 --> 00:44:47,531
Do you think I have nothing to say?
This is unfair.

676
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,159
This is unfair for me!

677
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,081
Unfair? Did you say it's unfair?

678
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,959
Are you going to kill him?

679
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,637
Depending on your intention,
it'll be either homicide or manslaughter.

680
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:15,434
If you wished to kill him,
it's attempted murder if you let go.

681
00:45:21,524 --> 00:45:22,441
Professor Kim.

682
00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:28,781
-Goodness.
-Professor Kim!

683
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:31,867
-Professor Kim!
-My gosh.

684
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:34,912
Professor Kim.

685
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:42,795
Call 911.

686
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:54,473
AMBULANCE

687
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:57,393
-How many weeks?
-At 22 weeks, 3 days.

688
00:45:57,476 --> 00:45:58,727
-Bleeding?
-15 minutes.

689
00:45:58,811 --> 00:45:59,645
Get Dr. Lee now.

690
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:00,688
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:08,320
Professor, are you okay?

692
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:09,238
I'm fine, right?

693
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:13,909
She's still bleeding.

694
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:16,245
What should I do?
Dr. Lee's surgery is delayed.

695
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:18,455
If you're in a hurry…

696
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:25,921
Professor, may I take a look?

697
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,637
All right.

698
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,312
I didn't know you came here, too,
prosecutor.

699
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:46,859
Gosh, that kid from before.

700
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:49,612
I'll get him locked up
for attempted murder.

701
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,076
Everyone there had a look
as if I deserved to die,

702
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,870
so they aren't going to help.

703
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,042
Could you be my witness?

704
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:06,462
You know, everything you saw. Please?

705
00:47:11,258 --> 00:47:14,345
Oh, so you didn't see anything?

706
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:17,848
Well, figures.
I also said I never saw anything.

707
00:47:19,224 --> 00:47:20,392
Still remember nothing?

708
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:30,110
I wonder if Judge Kim's kid is okay.

709
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:33,989
Blood.

710
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:37,076
If she lost blood, it can't be any good.

711
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:41,163
September 10th, 2008. The license plate
of the hit-and-run driver at Jurae-dong.

712
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:44,625
The accident for that kid
who witnessed your rape.

713
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:48,295
If I remembered anything,

714
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,298
what I said about
getting too drunk to remember

715
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,509
turns into a total lie.

716
00:47:57,012 --> 00:47:58,222
Why are you so obsessed?

717
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:00,766
You aren't a prosecutor anymore.

718
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:07,147
Because that hit-and-run case
is my only cold case.

719
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:10,401
I see. What a shame.

720
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:12,861
Goodness, what a shame.

721
00:48:13,654 --> 00:48:16,073
If I hadn't been so drunk,

722
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:18,200
I would've remembered that number.

723
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:21,370
I hope you'd remember it soon.

724
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:23,872
The statutory limitation expires soon.

725
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:27,001
Right, the statutory limitation.

726
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:34,383
Tell Professor Kim…

727
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:38,637
that I hope she gets better soon

728
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:40,806
and delivers her baby safely.

729
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:41,724
You can…

730
00:48:44,685 --> 00:48:46,520
remember that number now.

731
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,454
I might remember something
once I take this off.

732
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,833
Darn it.

733
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:24,266
OCTOBER 2020, PRESENT

734
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,241
Did you look into it?

735
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:42,701
<i>Yes, I did, prosecutor.</i>

736
00:49:44,578 --> 00:49:48,290
<i>As you said, professor, Lee Man-ho</i>
<i>was at Hankuk University yesterday</i>

737
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:50,084
<i>but left in the morning.</i>

738
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,795
<i>He remained outside</i>
<i>until the time of the incident.</i>

739
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:55,339
<i>I can't tell you anything else.</i>

740
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,258
<i>Detective Jang got mad at me</i>

741
00:49:58,342 --> 00:50:00,677
<i>for letting you into the crime scene</i>
<i>yesterday.</i>

742
00:50:01,303 --> 00:50:02,971
We never talked on the phone.

743
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:04,556
<i>Yes, goodbye.</i>

744
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:24,618
07P 4295

745
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:29,331
HANKUK ESTABLISHED

DEFAMATION CASES

747
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,001
GO SEE A DOCTOR FOR SNORING

748
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:34,336
I snore when I sleep?

749
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:35,254
PHONE ON SILENT

750
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:36,296
Do I snore?

751
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,090
-Do you? I'm not sure.
-You do.

752
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:40,884
And very loudly.

753
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,178
Was this you?

754
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,726
I saw Professor Seo in my dream last night
just as he looked when he died.

755
00:50:50,853 --> 00:50:52,855
I'm not studying in my right mind.

756
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,108
How many are those?

757
00:50:57,276 --> 00:50:58,735
He got as many as I did.

758
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:02,281
You picked up
every single defamation case in Korea.

759
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:06,326
I went through so much trouble
to find this one because of Joon-hwi.

760
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,037
This one and this one. I found those.

761
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:11,415
Did you bring everything?

762
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:13,458
We'll pick cases we might see on a test.

763
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:16,628
Let's pass cases that stated facts
since it's to be discarded.

764
00:51:16,712 --> 00:51:17,546
No.

765
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:22,342
Professors love questioning us
on reasons why it should be discarded.

766
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:23,802
I'll pick out a few for you.

767
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:24,720
-Wait.
-Look.

768
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:26,013
One second.

769
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:30,601
First, Article 310 of the Criminal Code--

770
00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:32,186
Wait, she's not here.

771
00:51:32,895 --> 00:51:35,105
We aren't losing time
for someone who's late.

772
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:36,940
Shocking news!

773
00:51:37,816 --> 00:51:39,234
I WON'T BE SAD FOR A DRUGGIE

774
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:40,903
I heard Professor Seo did drugs.

775
00:51:40,986 --> 00:51:42,279
-What?
-What?

776
00:51:44,323 --> 00:51:46,825
They found meth
in his office and in his car.

777
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:49,620
That makes no sense.

778
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:51,663
MY HUBBY

779
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:53,874
Leave it on silent.

780
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:56,335
This was you?

781
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:58,045
PHONE ON SILENT

782
00:51:58,128 --> 00:51:59,254
Look at this.

783
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:02,341
"I won't be sad for a druggie."

784
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:04,426
In the study group?

785
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:05,344
I'M NOT SURE

786
00:52:05,427 --> 00:52:07,221
-When will it end?
-Druggie.

787
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:08,305
That makes no sense.

788
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:09,806
Drugs?

789
00:52:15,187 --> 00:52:18,106
SEO BYUNG-JU OF HANKUK UNIVERSITY
HAD BEEN A DRUG ABUSER

790
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:28,158
COPY ROOM

791
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:34,289
If he was an addict,

792
00:52:34,373 --> 00:52:37,000
he more likely died in an accident
or killed himself.

793
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:39,628
Maybe they killed him
wanting us to think like that.

794
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:41,171
Then the culprit is…

795
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:44,007
The room where Professor Seo died

796
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:46,635
is only accessible
through the courtroom we were in

797
00:52:46,718 --> 00:52:48,428
and the door only professors can use.

798
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:51,974
-Give me a hand.
-But only we were there during the break.

799
00:52:52,057 --> 00:52:55,102
I don't recall seeing any outsiders
other than that deliveryman.

800
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,396
Where can I find Mr. Seo Byung-ju?

801
00:52:57,479 --> 00:52:58,563
Go through this door.

802
00:52:58,647 --> 00:52:59,773
Thank you.

803
00:53:00,482 --> 00:53:03,694
And the deliveryman came right out
after he went to drop it off.

804
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:09,533
So there might be a tragedy where
one of us gets arrested as a murderer…

805
00:53:19,793 --> 00:53:21,378
Can you tell him I'm in the shower?

806
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:26,383
You've reached Jeon Ye-seul's phone.

807
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:29,344
Hello.

808
00:53:29,428 --> 00:53:31,138
Ye-seul is in the shower--

809
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:32,931
Hey, Yeong-chang.

810
00:53:33,473 --> 00:53:34,433
No, it's okay.

811
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:36,518
No.

812
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:39,354
All right. Okay.

813
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:41,231
I should go take a shower instead.

814
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:50,490
Gosh, Yangcrates is taking over
Professor Seo's mock trial class!

815
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:08,633
On the day of her death,

816
00:54:08,717 --> 00:54:10,761
what did she say
as she drank at your place?

817
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,888
She wanted to break up.

818
00:54:13,472 --> 00:54:14,473
And what did you say?

819
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:15,640
That I didn't want to.

820
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:19,478
Things weren't great for Ro-na
after becoming a solo artist.

821
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,314
She got depressed
and often said she wanted to die.

822
00:54:23,023 --> 00:54:25,192
It's not that she didn't like me.

823
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,944
Everything was tormenting for her.

824
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,490
You wanted to keep the victim safe,

825
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:33,450
yet the victim

826
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:36,244
wanted to take her own life
and injected pentobarbital?

827
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,121
Yes.

828
00:54:39,206 --> 00:54:41,249
I got it to euthanize my dog,

829
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,126
but I never imagined she'd do that.

830
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,295
I should've managed it better.

831
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:46,505
MOCK TRIAL: CASE FILE

832
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:49,758
These are needle marks on her right arm
from the day of the incident.

833
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:52,719
You said she's left-handed,
so she can inject the drug herself.

834
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:54,554
Yes.

835
00:54:56,098 --> 00:54:58,225
The victim had fear of needles,

836
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,394
so she never got an IV
in her girl group days.

837
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:03,605
If she refused to be put on IV
at a hospital,

838
00:55:03,688 --> 00:55:06,024
could she really have stabbed her body

839
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:08,151
not just once but many times?

840
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:09,611
If she wanted to kill herself…

841
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:16,493
she could've mixed it with a drink.

842
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:22,791
Defendant.
Did you know she was afraid of needles?

843
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:32,759
Everyone, attention.

844
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:35,929
The police are here

845
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:37,722
for Professor Seo's case.

846
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,809
Officer Jang Dong-su
of Jungang Police Station.

847
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:44,333
Officer Jang Dong-su
of Jungang Police Station.

848
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:47,086
I'm here to investigate
Professor Seo Byung-ju's death.

849
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,088
I ask for your momentary cooperation.

850
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:52,883
These are the footprints
found on the scene.

851
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:54,218
Owners of the footprints

852
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:57,262
may become suspects
depending on their whereabouts.

853
00:55:57,972 --> 00:55:58,806
First off,

854
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:02,101
tailor-made dress shoes for men,
size 270mm.

855
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,358
Sneakers, size 275mm,

856
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:11,443
Air-sweep NB 384.

857
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:19,576
Sneakers, size 270mm, Pro-running AF.

858
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:26,125
Women's high heels, size 235mm.

859
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,209
Those are mine.

860
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:30,921
<i>I'm the initial witness,</i>
<i>so of course I'm there.</i>

861
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:32,798
Am I one of the suspects?

862
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:33,841
No exceptions.

863
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:37,511
Next, Airmax 507-J,

864
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:38,971
sneakers, size 275mm.

865
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,604
Maison Pature, limited edition sneakers
for 2020 fall-winter,

866
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:48,814
size 240mm.

867
00:56:54,028 --> 00:56:56,363
Those cost millions of won.

868
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,490
The autopsy result showed

869
00:56:58,574 --> 00:57:02,494
Professor Seo was murdered
by drug overdose.

870
00:57:04,246 --> 00:57:05,456
The drug, methamphetamine.

871
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:07,332
-What?
-What?

872
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:09,585
It's meth mixed with sugar.

873
00:57:11,754 --> 00:57:13,630
You're right. It was a trick.

874
00:57:14,715 --> 00:57:18,218
It looked like
someone forced Professor Seo to drink

875
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,554
a dangerous amount of meth
mixed into his coffee.

876
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:28,812
This is the disposable coffee cup
used by the campus cafe.

877
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,066
And the plastic bag
found on the day of the incident

878
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,650
in the trash can of the scene.

879
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:36,695
The same fingerprints
were found on both evidence,

880
00:57:36,779 --> 00:57:39,031
and it's getting identified.

881
00:57:41,075 --> 00:57:43,619
Arresting the culprit
is only a matter of time.

882
00:57:43,702 --> 00:57:46,330
We came here today to give you a chance--

883
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:49,249
I thought you came to get help,
but you came to threaten them.

884
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,834
I'm not threatening--

885
00:57:50,918 --> 00:57:52,419
Who thinks this is a threat?

886
00:57:53,462 --> 00:57:55,547
When a threat
causes fear in the other party

887
00:57:55,631 --> 00:57:57,132
and meddles with their decision,

888
00:57:57,216 --> 00:57:58,258
it can be punishable.

889
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,095
Who got scared
when he said he's giving a chance?

890
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,931
It almost made my high bun stand.

891
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,390
I didn't even do anything.

892
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:11,605
Please leave.

893
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,066
-I'm wrapping up Seo's class.
-Professor Yang.

894
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:17,653
Even if the culprit is here,
they can't leave during class.

895
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:20,531
Continue the trial.

896
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:25,369
Prosecution, continue your questioning.

897
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:28,747
EVIDENCE FROM THE SCENE

898
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,967
Did you know she was afraid of needles?

899
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:41,885
Of course you didn't.

900
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:42,970
If you had known,

901
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:46,807
you wouldn't have scripted a story
that the victim injected the drug herself.

902
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,684
Objection. That's a made-up story.

903
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:49,810
The defendant did.

904
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:53,522
You two,
stop talking about made-up stories.

905
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:55,232
Only state the facts--

906
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:12,958
Professor Yang Jong-hoon.

907
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,669
You're under emergency arrest
for Seo Byung-ju's murder.

908
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,474
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

909
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,935
You have the right to talk to a lawyer.

910
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:35,105
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

911
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,329
WAITING ROOM

912
01:00:07,012 --> 01:00:09,056
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE,
UNDER INVESTIGATION

913
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,967
Subtitle translation by Eun Sook Youn

914
01:01:37,978 --> 01:01:38,895
Did you do it alone?

915
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:40,897
<i>You would've left the country</i>

916
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:42,441
<i>had we not arrested you.</i>

917
01:01:42,524 --> 01:01:44,651
<i>He was deemed guilty</i>
<i>the moment they cuffed him.</i>

918
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,028
<i>Just confess to the crime.</i>

919
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,322
<i>I'll be done soon. Just talk to him.</i>

920
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:49,406
<i>Fire Yang Jong-hoon.</i>

921
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,658
Then change the rules and get him fired!

922
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:53,785
<i>If the Ministry allows,</i>
<i>I want to defend Yang.</i>

923
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:55,787
Then quit your job and defend him.

924
01:01:55,871 --> 01:01:58,165
<i>What's with you and Seo?</i>
<i>I know there's something.</i>

925
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:00,584
<i>Because Mr. Seo is his uncle.</i>

926
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,170
<i>I have no idea why your name is</i>
<i>in your uncle's will</i>

927
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,880
<i>he had written before he died.</i>

928
01:02:04,963 --> 01:02:06,965
<i>Even if Professor Yang</i>
<i>actually killed him,</i>

929
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:09,468
<i>I hate you more than him.</i>

930
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:11,303
<i>The Jurae-dong hit-and-run.</i>

931
01:02:11,386 --> 01:02:13,847
-Now, do you remember?
<i>-This is what I saw.</i>

932
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,265
<i>Don't tell me Seo is…</i>

933
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:16,892
<i>What about you?</i>

934
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:18,935
Did you kill him?

935
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:21,980
From this moment on,
I refuse to give any testimony.

936
