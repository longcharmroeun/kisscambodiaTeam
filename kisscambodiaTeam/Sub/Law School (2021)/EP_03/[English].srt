1
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:19,973
AUGUST 2017

2
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,394
I only get 30,000 won?

3
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:27,773
I paid over 300,000 won for all these.

4
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:31,818
Your sign shouldn't say, "We buy books,"
but "We only take your books for free."

5
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,570
-They're in awful shape.
-Next story.

6
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,531
-All useless. These are like trash.
-The trial for Seo,

7
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:37,949
a former chief prosecutor.

8
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,160
-The main issue
-No, no.

9
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:42,913
-is if the acquittal will be sustained.
-Don't you know?

10
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:45,499
-Reporter Choi is at the court.
-Take a good look.

11
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,375
-These look bad for a reason.
-Choi?

12
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:48,793
-Quiet, please.
-I am here

13
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:50,337
at Seo Byung-ju's final trial

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,048
-Whoever buys this hits a jackpot.
-in Seoul High Court.

15
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:54,466
-Here.
-Was the ruling made?

16
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,385
-And here. The notes look so perfect.
-Not yet.

17
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,597
-Will it be overturned?
-Study with this, and that's it.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,557
-Anyone will make it.
-We can't tell.

19
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,142
But Yang Jong-hoon, the prosecutor,

20
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:06,561
stepped down as a prosecutor
to be a witness--

21
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,730
Give me 50,000 won, then.

22
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:12,359
-So? Did you get into Hankuk Law School?
-What?

23
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,486
Don't talk big if you didn't.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,738
Yes, of course, I did.

25
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:18,114
So 50,000 won. Deal?

26
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:21,576
I was already offering much more
with 30,000 won, but I'll add 5,000 won

27
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,120
since you got into Hankuk University,
so 35,000 won.

28
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:26,081
-No, 50,000 won.
-I'll pay

29
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:28,250
the 50,000 won, so let me watch the news.

30
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,419
-But these are for law school--
-And I'm going there.

31
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:34,631
The ruling of the final appeal

32
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:37,384
of former chief prosecutor Seo Byung-ju
has just been made.

33
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:40,095
-These will get you in at once.
-The judges overturned

34
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:41,805
-the initial ruling
-You can do it.

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,932
and found him guilty of taking bribery.

36
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:48,854
Many are waiting to see if Seo will lodge
an appeal to the Supreme Court,

37
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:51,940
-waiting for the verdict.
-May I have the money now?

38
00:01:58,113 --> 00:02:01,366
Are you sure I'll get in at once,
Ms. Senior?

39
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:03,118
"Ms. Senior"?

40
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,870
I plan on going to Hankuk Law too.

41
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:07,247
I'd get in without these,

42
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,416
but it seems like you need the money.

43
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:17,299
Hey, my sister
isn't going to sell those books to--

44
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,009
Goodbye.

45
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:20,051
Hey, wait.

46
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,140
BALANCE: 994,350 WON

47
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,850
It's about time. Finally.

48
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:30,270
I'll have six zeroes in my account!

49
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,898
Are you that happy
for making that money by fraud?

50
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,066
Fraud?

51
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,069
Right, about Hankuk Law School?

52
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:40,739
You're too young to know what fraud is.

53
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:43,700
"A crime when someone defrauds another

54
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,410
and takes property from someone."

55
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,704
Article 347 of the Criminal Code.

56
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:52,250
I mean, I wasn't trying to deceive him--

57
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,461
You didn't do anything
knowing he was fooled

58
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,087
to take his money.

59
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,548
So? I'm a fraud now?

60
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:01,009
If you don't want to be one,
you should get in.

61
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,135
Get in? To where?

62
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:03,637
To Hankuk Law School.

63
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:05,430
Me?

64
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,349
Hey, Byeol.

65
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:10,310
Do you think a law school
is like a community center?

66
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,062
And Hankuk Law School?

67
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,773
It's not for everyone.

68
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:18,234
-You're good at English.
-I'm just all right.

69
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:19,945
Millions of people are better.

70
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:21,613
But your college grades are good.

71
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:24,491
That's because Dan practically helped out
with everything…

72
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,409
Why do you do this to me?

73
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:28,954
You can get Dan's books back
and study again.

74
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:31,039
You said you can get accepted at once.

75
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,624
Hey, at once? My foot.

76
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:36,127
I made up a total lie
to get him to pay me more.

77
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:41,633
Then, you must feel sorry
for that guy, right?

78
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:43,259
Did he make me feel any sorrier?

79
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:44,552
He claims he's a big shot.

80
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,304
He said he'd get in without those.

81
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,139
But still.

82
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:51,017
And he offered the money first.

83
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,186
I should've made him pay twice as much.

84
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,314
How much more do you want?

85
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:00,735
And it wasn't just a claim. I'm that good.

86
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:04,364
How much more should I give you
to make you feel ashamed

87
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,699
for playing a law student?

88
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:10,787
There's nothing you can do
to make her feel ashamed.

89
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,998
She'd rather get into Hankuk Law School.

90
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,083
I'll get going then.

91
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,003
Byeol. Hey, Byeol!

92
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,090
YOUR GUIDE TO LEET

93
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:35,520
FRIDAY 7:40 P.M., MUST SWITCH
THE TIME OF DEPARTURE TO THE VICTIM'S…

94
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,398
You even quit to have him punished.
How do you feel now?

95
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:39,983
I feel crappy.

96
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:43,278
You testified Seo made you a request
back when you were on duty.

97
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,031
It was accepted
and the case was overturned on appeal.

98
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:48,533
But we still have the Supreme Court
to go to.

99
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:51,911
Do you believe the Supreme Court
could overturn the decision again?

100
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,788
If my testimony isn't found reliable.

101
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:56,666
I heard you and Seo
were very close as colleagues.

102
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,042
What happened to you two?

103
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:12,265
TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY BY THE LAW

104
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,017
Inmate 2023, it's your court day.

105
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,827
DONGBU DETENTION CENTER WAITING ROOM

106
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:49,761
Based on that, the police identified
Yang Jong-hoon as the prime suspect.

107
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:51,971
The on-site inspection Yang requested

108
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,681
will be conducted today.

109
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:57,352
The request was made unprecedentedly
by Yang, the suspect,

110
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,687
right before his indictment.

111
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:02,816
Yang has been pleading the Fifth
until this day.

112
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,359
The change in his attitude is…

113
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,278
Hey, Kim.

114
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,240
Postponing the indictment?

115
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,117
He said he'd admit
if we do a spot inspection.

116
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,328
A former prosecutor
killed his former chief.

117
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,288
It's a huge shame on the prosecution.

118
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:18,706
A formal briefing? No way.

119
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:24,379
I didn't say that just to Choi.

120
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,673
It's just something I said over a meal.

121
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:28,675
If you can't trust me,
come out for a meal.

122
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,677
Are you telling him about suspected crime?

123
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,304
Let's talk later.

124
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:36,224
You said I killed him
over his deal with Lee Man-ho

125
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:37,767
to cover up his hit-and-run.

126
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:39,894
It's not a bad story for you.

127
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:42,397
The more the media talk,

128
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,899
the more people will become furious
at Seo Byung-ju.

129
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:46,401
If the people feel that way,

130
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:48,111
it'll help reduce your sentence.

131
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:52,782
I know you're like this,
but you're still my senior.

132
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:55,451
I have everything set up for you.

133
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,705
-Article 126 of the Criminal Code.
-Publicizing suspected crime?

134
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,374
There's no use for that law anyway.

135
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,126
LAW AGAINST PUBLICIZING A SUSPECT

136
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,004
There's no prosecutor
who was ever indicted for doing that.

137
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:09,716
The media kept going on
about how the former chief prosecutor

138
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,178
was in league with a heinous rapist,

139
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,721
so most people are saying

140
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:17,140
they hate the deceased
more than the killer.

141
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:20,727
Let's make it so that people can see
how anyone could become furious

142
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,437
and would want to kill someone

143
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,148
during the spot inspection.

144
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,152
Can you free him until we get there?

145
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:31,362
After all, he's my senior.

146
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:41,164
Feeling the urge to kill Seo
in that moment,

147
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,000
Yang poured the entire sachet of meth
into the coffee.

148
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,752
It was sugar, not meth.

149
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:49,756
Stop writing a novel.

150
00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:58,848
No, stop it!

151
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:02,435
After I dumped his methamphetamine
in the sink,

152
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:06,981
he went into hypoglycemic shock.

153
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,737
I found a single-serve sugar packet here,
not an ordinary packaging.

154
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,702
-You never said that before.
-He refused to testify.

155
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,205
He's about to talk now.

156
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,919
Let's just say there's sugar.

157
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:29,837
Well, excuse me.

158
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:33,383
You can use this.

159
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:35,927
It's edible collagen, for your skin.

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,596
Fine.

161
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:14,549
He passed out from hypoglycemia,

162
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,342
so I gave him coffee with sugar.

163
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:21,931
But it wasn't there at the scene.

164
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,141
The sugar packet.

165
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:30,148
We didn't find a sugar packet,
and it's not on the evidence list.

166
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,943
Stop trying to pull this trick on us.
It was never…

167
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,237
It was never here to--

168
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:37,739
It was here to begin with.

169
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,449
You need to cut your crap.

170
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:41,117
What is he yapping about?

171
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:42,827
Gosh.

172
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,583
Tell them to hear him out.

173
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,419
Please hear out my client--

174
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:54,047
Then, he'll need
to at least make some sense.

175
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,632
If it was here to begin with,
where would it go?

176
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:58,426
We already combed through the office.

177
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,064
It fell out of the glasses?

178
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,732
He rolled down the stairs?

179
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:13,649
Detective Oh.

180
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,027
-Check the glasses Seo was wearing.
-Yes, sir.

181
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:43,471
It was you?

182
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,102
Just kill me!

183
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,187
Turn yourself in now!

184
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:55,817
Han Joon-hwi.

185
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:06,160
11:10 A.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

186
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,472
YOU RECEIVED A NEW EMAIL

187
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,935
FROM SEO BYUNG-JU,
JURAE-DONG HIT-AND-RUN CASE

188
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:21,360
SEO BYUNG-JU

189
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:28,034
-Hello?
-This is Yang Jong-hoon.

190
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,118
Give me a second.

191
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,829
Let me call you back.

192
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,832
Now that Joon-hwi knows,

193
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,669
Jong-hoon will also find out soon.

194
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,814
WITNESS WANTED

195
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,069
HONGIM REAL ESTATE AGENCY

196
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,282
Yes, that's my real estate agency.

197
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,117
My husband used to run this place.

198
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:14,205
Someone else recently came by
to check too.

199
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,332
A middle-aged man in glasses?

200
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,835
No, he was a young man
without any glasses.

201
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,255
He was wearing a hoodie that day.

202
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,843
Was it him?

203
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:29,387
Yes, it was him.

204
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,433
HAN JOON-HWI

205
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,562
The video
for the Jurae-dong hit-and-run case?

206
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:42,733
Yes.

207
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:44,819
I sent it.

208
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,412
You were the prosecutor in charge.

209
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:58,124
DO NOT ENTER

210
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:00,167
Someone had to reveal the truth.

211
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:05,548
You met your uncle here on that day,
didn't you?

212
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,653
Did you have to be the one to reveal…

213
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,699
the truth?

214
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,123
Did you kill him?

215
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,336
Professor Yang Jong-hoon singled you out.

216
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:48,924
I asked, did you kill him?

217
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:52,637
You do have a good reason.

218
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,931
He left a huge inheritance to you,
a kid who isn't even his own.

219
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,358
Sign that in front of me…

220
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,068
DISCLAIMER OF INTEREST BY HEIR

221
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,446
unless you want to be suspected.

222
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,617
You betrayed your uncle.

223
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,913
He thought of you more dearly
than his own daughters,

224
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:21,540
yet you stabbed him in the back!

225
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:30,257
That's not for you to say.

226
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:32,468
What?

227
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,805
You used your kids
as an excuse to stay in the US,

228
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,390
you even took another lover.

229
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,355
I have every right to know
who killed my husband.

230
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:45,648
Asking if I killed him?

231
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:48,943
Think however you want.

232
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:52,196
There's only one answer
you want anyway, Aunt.

233
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,575
Sit!

234
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,332
You have no right to do this to me.

235
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,420
And don't come to see me
with something like this.

236
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,973
We can't prove that this belongs
to the deceased.

237
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:20,599
I request a second autopsy.

238
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:28,149
A second autopsy? Because of this?

239
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:32,027
He had a bad headache on the said day,
which hindered his mock trial class.

240
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:35,197
He could've fallen down
since his nose pad was found here.

241
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,532
That's just a possibility--

242
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,451
That's where the investigation begins.

243
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,496
Is this the reason for this inspection?

244
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,458
You're trying to postpone the indictment
by using the inspection

245
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,751
and a second autopsy?

246
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,838
The nose pad is intact
on the glasses he wore.

247
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:51,839
See?

248
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:54,341
Do you have anything else to say?

249
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:55,801
They were switched.

250
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:01,015
Mr. Seo was wearing rimless glasses
on that day.

251
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,934
Thanks.

252
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:07,855
But when I left after giving him coffee,

253
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:11,108
his glasses were changed
to those black ones for some reason.

254
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,151
He's right.

255
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:16,405
He was wearing rimless glasses
when we talked during the break.

256
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:23,370
Why didn't you keep your mouth shut
and continue to plead the Fifth?

257
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:24,872
Darn it!

258
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:27,625
The autopsy report didn't show
any brain damage--

259
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,670
And I wanted a photo proof,
but why is the attachment left out?

260
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:34,799
What?

261
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:36,383
It really isn't here.

262
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,344
They said the camera wasn't working.

263
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,428
Right at that moment?

264
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:42,181
You could've been suspicious.

265
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:45,017
Suspicious, my foot.
Stop insulting medical examiners.

266
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:46,936
We can't redo the autopsy.

267
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:48,813
Not only is your evidence weak,

268
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:51,273
but if we had to take out his body
from the ground,

269
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:52,942
his bereaved family will protest.

270
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:54,026
What if we don't?

271
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,703
I need to know clearly
who killed my husband.

272
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,374
Please do the second autopsy.

273
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:18,509
Prof. Yang wanted a second autopsy?

274
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,760
It's a sudden twist.

275
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:21,303
A second autopsy isn't easy.

276
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,848
If he was buried, he'd be decomposed too.

277
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:25,641
They buried him quite recently.

278
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,810
Professor Seo's wife
got here late from the US.

279
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,228
Really?

280
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,105
Well, if he was in the morgue, yes.

281
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:33,524
But still, he has to prove

282
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:35,818
there was a sugar packet
to prove his innocence.

283
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:36,861
You're right.

284
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:38,612
I don't really think I saw it.

285
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:41,198
The culprit took it?

286
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:42,575
To frame Professor Yang?

287
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:45,661
Am I sure of this?

288
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:48,372
Yes, we are.

289
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,418
If the real culprit took it,

290
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:56,505
he or she must've known Professor Yang
gave Professor Seo that coffee with sugar.

291
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:00,342
If he was going to frame Professor Yang,
knowing what happened,

292
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:02,803
isn't this premeditated homicide,
not manslaughter?

293
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:03,888
You're right.

294
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,264
And someone with a grudge.

295
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:07,558
A grudge? That means
it's most likely Professor Yang.

296
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:11,937
If it's not him, that means the culprit

297
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:14,815
is someone who was in there
among the testifiers here today.

298
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:16,066
She just found him first.

299
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,694
Professor Yang seems to be
suspicious of Joon-hwi.

300
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:19,945
-Joon-hwi?
-Han Joon-hwi?

301
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,280
He's suspecting Joon-hwi?

302
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,365
Does it make sense?

303
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,367
Why not? He even put up that petition.

304
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:26,952
That petition was--

305
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,287
He thought of him as a son,

306
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,831
but he still put that up,
refusing to accept his uncle.

307
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,458
Then, why not?

308
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:37,588
MY HUBBY

309
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,139
Hey, babe. I left it on silent
during the spot inspection.

310
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,059
-I mean it.
-But still, it can't be Joon-hwi.

311
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,769
I hope not.

312
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:53,896
It can't be him, right?

313
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:57,942
If Professor Yang is suspecting him,
he must have a reason.

314
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,736
If you're curious,
you can ask his public defender.

315
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:01,904
He's our senior.

316
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:03,364
He didn't seem enthusiastic.

317
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,991
Right? It looked
as if he was forced into this.

318
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,243
He didn't seem too trustworthy.

319
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,454
It'd be perfect
if Professor Kim Eun-suk took him.

320
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:12,164
-Mr. Yang.
-Did you admit to it?

321
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,958
-Did you confirm everything?
-Mr. Yang!

322
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,417
-What happened?
-Was it you?

323
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,585
Did you kill him?

324
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,128
-Say something!
-Did you do it?

325
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,255
-Did he break his silence?
-Mr. Yang!

326
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,840
-Did you do it?
-It's you, right?

327
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,884
-Say something!
-How did you kill him?

328
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:26,011
-Did you clarify it?
-What's your motive?

329
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,556
Professor Yang wanted a second autopsy?

330
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:35,604
A second autopsy?

331
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:38,649
Did he deny his charge
instead of admitting to what he did?

332
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:41,235
Was there a problem
in the initial investigation?

333
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,320
What problem? There wasn't a problem.

334
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:44,321
Do you admit to it?

335
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,823
-Do you?
-Did you do this?

336
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:46,865
Say something!

337
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,409
Why did he want the autopsy?

338
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:50,160
You can talk to him later!

339
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,872
You need to defend him
and tell them it's to prove his innocence!

340
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:54,873
What's with you?

341
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,250
Come here.

342
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,501
-Quick.
-Anything to say?

343
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,879
I know I can't be an attorney
as a law professor,

344
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:03,674
but at least,
let me be his public defender.

345
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,009
Ask the Minister of Education.

346
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:08,095
I believe the Min. of Justice stated
professors of the Legal Clinic

347
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:09,805
working as public defenders

348
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:12,307
is not a breach
of the Attorneys-at-Law Act.

349
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:14,643
If the Ministry allows,
I want to defend Yang.

350
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,855
Innocent or not,
this job isn't for our Legal Clinic.

351
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:21,108
People will end up criticizing and say
we're trying to protect our own.

352
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:23,235
We should protect him
if he's falsely accused.

353
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:25,487
Read this article.

354
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,281
The media arbitrarily reported on him

355
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:29,033
and turned him into a murderer

356
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:30,659
even before he got indicted!

357
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:33,037
When I say no,
I mean that you can't do it!

358
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,040
Then, quit your job and defend him!

359
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,791
-Vice Dean!
-Professor Kim!

360
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,879
I understand you two were very close
since the training institute--

361
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:43,505
It's not because we're close.

362
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,674
Well, I guess we are.

363
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:48,969
But I'd do the same for you
if you were falsely accused.

364
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:51,054
That won't happen, so get back to work.

365
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:52,973
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

366
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,519
There's no use
in visiting the dean over this.

367
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:00,606
We've decided to dismiss him
once he gets indicted.

368
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,235
You sound as if you want him to.

369
00:22:06,236 --> 00:22:08,405
Well, you're very close
to Professor Jung Dae-hyeon,

370
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,365
who has been
after Professor Yang's position.

371
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:17,122
If he's suspicious of Joon-hwi,

372
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,917
does this mean he also took
Professor Yang's laptop?

373
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:24,087
A laptop isn't easy to throw out,
so he probably hid it.

374
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:25,631
I'd hide it under my mattress.

375
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:27,591
The police will think like you,

376
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:29,426
so a locker for me.

377
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,929
Hiding it in my stuff
could be much better.

378
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,806
They'll find it during the search.

379
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,557
Stop talking behind a guy's back.

380
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:37,768
If you're dying to know, ask him.

381
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:42,606
He'd have to be around for us to ask.
Or you can ask him for us.

382
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,609
Don't you have a study group to go to?

383
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,862
What about our study group?
Joon-hwi won't be there.

384
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,032
Exactly. Where did he go?

I can't believe you wanted to see me.
Did you see the court?

407
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,750
It's probably the most fabulous mock court
in this world.

408
00:25:09,544 --> 00:25:12,923
Not only will you hold mock trials,
the court will do real ones too.

413
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,294
It was your car.

Joon-hwi.

415
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:54,423
Joon-hwi.

416
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,510
It was your car.

Car number 07P 4295.

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:02,264
Joon-hwi.

419
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:03,765
It was your car.

420
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,643
It was yours! It was your car!

421
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,193
Why?

422
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:18,280
Why did you do that?

423
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:28,206
Why?

424
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,126
Why did you do that?

425
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,504
They took the banner down.

426
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,550
Goodness.

427
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:45,599
Is it because of what I did?

428
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:48,143
It's not getting developed.

429
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:49,936
Lee Man-ho was the witness?

430
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,189
I think the deceased made a deal
with Lee Man-ho

431
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:55,942
and let him off with feeble mindedness
to cover up his hit-and-run case.

432
00:26:58,779 --> 00:26:59,863
He hit him here, bang.

433
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:01,198
Vroom.

434
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,709
How dare a guy like me

435
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,879
hold his weakness
and shake your uncle around.

436
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:19,591
Yes, I did that. I did.

437
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:23,970
That was the only way I could save myself.

438
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:29,017
Hey, I'm sad about this too.

439
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:32,729
Deal or whatever, he's my savior
who let me stand here today.

440
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:38,693
The only guy who took my side is gone.

441
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:47,077
Darn it.

442
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:51,748
My blood is valuable.

443
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:56,837
About your uncle…

444
00:27:58,213 --> 00:28:00,257
He kept a pair of spare glasses
in his car.

445
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:04,928
But on the day he died,
it disappeared from his car.

446
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,476
You're his bereaved family,

447
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,896
so find out if they're on the list
of evidence or his articles.

448
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,962
You won't redo the autopsy, right?

449
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:43,091
His family strongly insists, so…

450
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:44,426
Just have him indicted.

451
00:28:46,052 --> 00:28:47,262
I can't just indict him!

452
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:49,222
-What I meant was--
-Also,

453
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:51,558
why did you miss the nose pad
in the first search?

454
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:53,310
This is a high-profile case.

455
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:58,523
So this is our fault?

456
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,525
-Is it?
-Whoa, wait.

457
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:03,236
Open up!

458
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,988
Darn it.

459
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:06,990
He wanted the case transferred ASAP.

460
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:09,326
He's the one
who leaked the case to the media!

461
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,421
I heard Inmate 2023 made a big scene
at the inspection.

462
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:23,215
After all, he was a prosecutor.

463
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,091
He might end up leaving soon.

464
00:29:57,749 --> 00:29:59,876
Let's not contaminate the scene.
Step back.

465
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,086
-What?
-Is he dead?

466
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:02,170
Should we report this?

467
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:03,463
-Is he dead?
-He's down?

468
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:04,714
-What?
-What's going on?

469
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:29,489
MOM

470
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:42,127
The prosecution's decisive argument
will be Jamie's fear of needles.

471
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:44,504
Six months before the case,

472
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:47,674
the victim began to give insulin shots
to her diabetic mother.

473
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:50,343
So she can now inject shots herself?

474
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,262
That's pretty good.

475
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,146
But it seems more plausible
for the suspect to have killed her

476
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,232
out of a sense of betrayal
than her committing suicide.

477
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:06,610
How is murdering her in betrayal

478
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:08,778
more plausible than…

479
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:13,325
If he loved her,

480
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,577
it could happen, right?

YOU HAVE 8 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM

488
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:11,007
You think Joon-hwi is the real culprit,
don't you?

489
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,678
You believe he pushed my husband
down those stairs.

490
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:17,263
It's just a speculation.

491
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:19,641
We need to do a second autopsy
to know for sure.

492
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:23,395
I find Joon-hwi more suspicious than you,
Prosecutor Yang.

493
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:27,774
Once Byung-ju dies,
he'll inherit a huge amount of money.

494
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:31,403
Are you saying he wanted his inheritance?

495
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:34,197
I've lived for decades
as a prosecutor's wife.

496
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,615
And he has enough reasons

497
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,200
other than the inheritance.

498
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,913
He treated his uncle like vermin
ever since the bribery case broke out.

499
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:46,960
He's an ungrateful rascal
who repaid his uncle's kindness with evil.

500
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:54,259
It's too unfair
for you to be stuck in there.

501
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:58,430
We must reveal the truth
by conducting a second autopsy.

502
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:13,445
The medical examiner you mentioned before,

503
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:15,071
are you sure he's good?

504
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,619
What? I can't see him?

505
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:23,705
OK CIVIL AFFAIRS CENTER

506
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,333
I came a little too late.

507
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,002
Joon-hwi's aunt got here first.

508
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,129
-Professor Seo's wife?
-Yes.

509
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:32,964
What brings you here?

510
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,179
Can you let me in, too?

511
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:41,055
Someone else got in, so I couldn't.

512
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,142
-You can come tomorrow.
-Wait.

513
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:45,435
I have to talk to him.

514
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:47,145
Then be his attorney.

515
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:49,814
This visit is only for his attorney to--

516
00:33:49,898 --> 00:33:51,065
Tell him we're interns.

517
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,402
Exactly.

518
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:58,865
I thought about this all night.

519
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,911
Regardless of the autopsy result,
finding the culprit who fed meth--

520
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:04,245
The prosecutor should.

521
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:07,999
The prosecutor framed you as the murderer,
so to prove your innocence…

522
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:10,251
-Why should I prove my innocence?
-Sorry?

523
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,213
-Do I have to prove my innocence?
-No, sir.

524
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,298
What? He'll be found guilty.

525
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:16,716
The evidence of the crime.

526
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,719
All you have to do
is discredit or withdraw the reliability

527
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:21,596
-of the prosecution's evidence.
-What?

528
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,848
If the autopsy changes
the cause of his death,

529
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,559
it'll discredit
the prosecution's evidence.

530
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:31,356
Is that why you wore those glasses?

531
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:36,569
The sugar packet wasn't the only thing
that went missing.

532
00:34:58,216 --> 00:34:59,092
OCTOBER 5TH: 911

533
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:03,513
OCTOBER 5TH: 911

534
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:05,265
SEPTEMBER 23: PROFESSOR KIM EUN-SUK

535
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:08,017
Is this 911?

536
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:09,394
Please speak.

537
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:11,062
I'm at Hankuk Law's mock court.

538
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:13,731
My professor fell down the stairs
and fainted.

539
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:16,317
-Is he breathing?
-One second.

540
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:19,279
Hello?

541
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:20,363
Please speak.

542
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:23,074
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

543
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:42,051
How did you know he talked to 911?

544
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:44,804
I told him to check the call history
with 911 for that day.

545
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,222
Han Joon-hwi made a call.

546
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:47,724
And he fell down the stairs.

547
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:51,561
-Did you find out?
-Sorry?

548
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:53,855
Right, yes. The police are correct.

549
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:54,814
MONITORING CENTER

550
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:56,065
As I told the police,

551
00:35:56,149 --> 00:36:00,862
Lee Man-ho was at Hankuk University
that morning as Professor Seo's driver.

552
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:02,614
But he left right away.

553
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,490
PERSONAL DETAILS

554
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:07,619
Lee Man-ho was definitely away from school
at the time of his death.

555
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,704
They can trace his location
with his anklet.

556
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:11,998
Don't people cut that off and run away?

557
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:16,252
The police also thought
Lee Man-ho could've tampered with it,

558
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:19,589
so they checked every place he visited
before and after his death.

559
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:26,512
I checked everything myself, too.

560
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:28,556
Lee Man-ho has a solid alibi.

561
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,144
Did you want to get on his good side
by looking up everything?

562
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:36,522
I'm guessing
you didn't seem trustworthy enough

563
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:38,399
if he made me do that separately.

564
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:40,026
Does this mean

565
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:42,070
it was Joon-hwi?

566
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,409
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

567
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:51,871
We confirmed
how your uncle rolled down the stairs.

568
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:53,915
If he had brain damage,

569
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,709
that means he could've died
after some time has passed.

570
00:36:58,503 --> 00:36:59,671
The cause of death is…

571
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:02,423
Are you also suspicious
of the autopsy result?

572
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,972
-How did you find this?
-I just did.

573
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:10,056
I doubt it was easy.

574
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:11,516
But nothing's impossible.

575
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,727
So you went to the Police University?

576
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:17,313
But you dropped out
before half a year passed.

577
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:18,815
Because of your inheritance,

578
00:37:18,898 --> 00:37:21,651
your aunt suspects it was you
over Yang Jong-hoon.

579
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:23,987
Will you do the second autopsy?

580
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,072
What if we do? Will that be a problem?

581
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,200
You didn't kill him.

582
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:32,370
Did you kill him?

583
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:35,581
Did you push him down the stairs

584
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,419
and get rid of the sugar packet
Yang mentioned?

585
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:41,170
I thought I was a testifier.

586
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:43,172
Yes, so answer my question.

587
00:37:47,677 --> 00:37:49,429
If you didn't, say so.

588
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:52,557
Do you want to leave
as a suspect, not a testifier?

589
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,769
-You probably can't do that.
-What?

590
00:37:56,853 --> 00:38:00,606
If you have two suspects
who aren't accomplices for one case,

591
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,818
isn't it humiliating
for the detective and the prosecutor?

592
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:04,819
What did you say?

593
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:08,114
You'll have to let Professor Yang go
if I become the suspect.

594
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:12,493
I'm saying a second autopsy
won't do you any good, prosecutor.

595
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:17,999
Could I be excused?

596
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:19,709
I have to be in a class.

597
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,044
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

598
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:30,845
That little rascal. Darn it!

599
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:32,764
Let's do the second autopsy.

600
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:35,725
Of course I don't want to do it.

601
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,186
But we can't let him toy with us.

602
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,190
Find out everything on Han Joon-hwi.

603
00:38:43,941 --> 00:38:45,401
Get the warrant for the autopsy.

604
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:47,361
That's a great decision.

605
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:51,657
My gosh.

606
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:15,306
Excuse us.

607
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,941
Hey.

608
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,359
Hey, you!

609
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:29,403
What are you looking for?

610
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,948
What is it?

611
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,367
What are you looking for?

612
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,622
CONSTITUTION 1

613
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:46,420
Professor Kang said it's all my fault
if any of you get in there with a laptop.

614
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:49,966
Your grades are out.

615
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:53,177
Our grades? Goodness.

616
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,769
2ND SEMESTER MIDTERM GRADES
IN CONSTITUTION

617
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:05,106
What? Our average is in the 30s again?

618
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:07,692
Why does Professor Kang
never give out good grades?

619
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:10,403
The average for Civil Procedure Code
is five.

620
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:13,114
You get an A+ if you score over ten.
Unbelievable.

621
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:16,242
I'm sure everyone here never got
such a low grade before law school.

622
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:18,536
No way. I think I'll get an A+.

623
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:20,204
One second.

624
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,624
I'm awesome. I did better than Ji-ho?

625
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:26,669
How do you know my grade?

626
00:40:26,752 --> 00:40:29,881
I saw you write your nickname
in the start of the year. "Fewgoodmen."

627
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:32,842
Gosh, you and your sentimentalism.
Good for you.

628
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:34,677
Are you kidding? Don't look at mine.

629
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,138
I have to do a little recon
before the game begins.

630
00:40:37,221 --> 00:40:39,432
I need to know who's ahead of me.

631
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:42,476
Hey, but this time, I got ahead of you.

632
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,394
Good luck.

633
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:46,147
What?

634
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,317
Wait, what is this? 90-something?
"Newbeginning"?

635
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,318
Who's this?

636
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,195
Could it be…

637
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:54,697
You're right. He got 91 points.
It's Seung-jae.

638
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,283
HOLDOUTANDWIN: 29

639
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:59,785
My gosh, how is this grade possible?

640
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,204
No one got up to the 80s.

641
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:03,706
See? Even Joon-hwi got 71 points.

642
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:04,916
The one below him, 69.

643
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,879
Why couldn't he give me one more point?

644
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,506
You still did better than me.

645
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,766
I should do better on the finals.

646
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,101
NEWBEGINNING

647
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:25,102
Gosh.

648
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:28,147
No matter how well I'll do in the finals,
I'll never get A+.

649
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:30,399
Ji-ho, aren't you in danger?

650
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:32,610
I'll be fine if Joon-hwi leaves.

651
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,278
If he leaves?

652
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:38,824
Right. I heard he might be disciplined
by the Student Discipline Committee.

653
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:40,993
If he's the real culprit
of Professor Seo's case,

654
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:42,203
he'll naturally leave.

655
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:44,288
My gosh.
How can you think of such a thing?

656
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:45,748
It's just grades, not the bar.

657
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,334
Your grades are what will get you a job
at a law firm.

658
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,877
Grades stay for life, not exams.

659
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,629
Grades are more important.

660
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:54,298
Ji-ho, that's a bit harsh
as a fellow student.

661
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:58,010
Only half the people pass the bar now,
so one of you two won't make it.

662
00:41:58,094 --> 00:42:00,221
A fellow?
We aren't soldiers or undergraduates.

663
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:02,056
This is a training school.

664
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:06,143
Don't you secretly wish Sol gets a zero
for turning in her test late?

665
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:07,895
What?

666
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,483
I'm going to kill you.

667
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:13,526
CONSTITUTION 1

668
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:15,653
Excuse me.

669
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:18,489
Where's Professor Kang Ju-man's class?

670
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:19,657
Right here.

671
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,121
-He's here.
-Quiet.

672
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:31,669
I'm not going to accept any objections
regarding your grades.

673
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:34,005
Do not make a trip to my office in vain.

674
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:37,008
-Who's supposed to be there?
-Han Joon-hwi.

675
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,679
-Joon-hwi, where are you?
-Minus one point.

676
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:45,725
HAN JOON-HWI: 69

677
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:47,560
You lost your precious point.

678
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:49,478
Over there.

679
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,065
Well, I'm Yu Seung-jae.

680
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:56,319
You're late, but I'll let you off.

681
00:42:56,902 --> 00:42:59,989
Again, his answers were great
for this test,

682
00:43:00,072 --> 00:43:01,615
as if he was reading my mind.

683
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,995
Turn to page 115 of your textbook.

684
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,622
The dispute and clash of human rights.

685
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:14,170
Like teacher, like student.

686
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:15,671
Han Joon-hwi.

687
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:18,466
He's as unusual as you.

688
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,428
I'm in the mood for some coffee.

689
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,638
I guess you won't treat me
with respect today.

690
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:28,934
Hang in there. Once you get out--

691
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:30,644
We'll extend your stay,

692
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,813
regardless of the second autopsy.

693
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:35,775
Why? Wait.

694
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:38,069
If his cause of death changes
in the autopsy--

695
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:41,030
There's not a lot of chance
things will turn around.

696
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:44,742
And he can still destroy evidence,
just like the missing laptop.

697
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,786
-I didn't hide the laptop.
-But lost it?

698
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:48,537
I didn't lose it. It was stolen.

699
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,583
You're going to change your argument?

700
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:55,211
I had time to think
in the detention center.

701
00:43:56,754 --> 00:44:00,674
Come to think of it, I left my laptop
in my office on the day of the incident.

702
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,927
It was gone the next day.

703
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,139
It was obviously stolen.

704
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,600
Who'd steal that anyway?

705
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:10,976
You're right.

706
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,271
The one who stole it wanted it to look
as if you destroyed the evidence

707
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:15,773
to put you in a tight spot.

708
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,691
The sugar packet and the laptop.

709
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:20,611
Don't you think they're gone
for the same reason?

710
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:21,695
So you didn't do it?

711
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:24,281
It's Joon-hwi who destroyed the evidence.

712
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:27,493
He hid those glasses
with the missing nose pad.

713
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,662
We need to clarify the facts.

714
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:33,999
-We will.
-Of course we will, Prosecutor Jin.

715
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,877
Don't just look at what you want to see

716
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,296
and listen to what you want to hear.

717
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:55,479
Darn it.

718
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,065
Where's that case for his glasses?

719
00:44:58,149 --> 00:45:00,109
Why can't they find it?

720
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:03,279
Maybe Ji-ho forgot to put the case
where he found it.

721
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:06,991
You have no time to stretch your legs.

722
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:09,743
Look at what you got me into.
Han Joon-hwi, that kid--

723
00:45:09,827 --> 00:45:12,830
Don't I seem more suspicious
if you look at the hard evidence?

724
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,415
My goodness.

725
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,333
All evidence is fact.

726
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,671
Then just be the culprit.

727
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,633
Let's wait for the autopsy result.

728
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,305
That's all for today.

729
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:36,145
Excuse me.

730
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:38,564
I have questions on Han Joon-hwi
about the incident.

731
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:39,773
Please don't leave.

732
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:43,444
Cooperate unless you want to be summoned
as a testifier.

733
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:45,571
Why are you taking our time?

734
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,114
-Exactly.
-What is he doing?

735
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:49,408
That's a threat, not cooperation.

736
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:52,745
If you need us, summon us to the station.

737
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:56,624
Darn it.

738
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:12,348
When did we get this?

739
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:15,142
Why haven't I seen it?

740
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:18,062
It'd be perfect with rice,
but we're completely out right now.

741
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:23,275
Mom, I saw this man a few days ago at the…

742
00:46:24,693 --> 00:46:25,819
Mom, the address!

743
00:46:25,903 --> 00:46:27,655
What? What about the address?

Good for you, Inmate 2023.
They're redoing the autopsy.

748
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:48,676
If they're digging up a body
they buried already,

749
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:49,843
he'll get out soon.

750
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:53,681
The law school murderer sure is different.

751
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:58,185
Hey, share your secret with us
before you get out, okay?

752
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:47,484
Prosecutor Yang.

753
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:49,945
Long time no see.

754
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:52,489
I always told myself

755
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:55,242
I'll kill you first
once I get out of here,

756
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,620
but you came in here yourself.

757
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:02,750
Does it hurt?

758
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,878
It hurts, doesn't it?

759
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:10,090

If you need me in any way,
feel free to make use of me.

This is Kim Eun-suk.

Professor Yang? How bad is it?

777
00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:46,854
-Are you okay?
-You okay?

778
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:54,528
Make sure you keep the door locked.

LEE MAN-HO'S ADDRESS

781
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:01,261
What happened?

782
00:51:01,345 --> 00:51:03,555
How did he get stabbed with a knife?

783
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:06,975
Inmate 2023 was attacked
by a thug he arrested as a prosecutor.

784
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:09,019
So it was revenge?

785
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:11,647
Inmate 2023 came just as the attacker

786
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:13,774
was swearing to kill him.

787
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:16,026
Doctor, what happened?

788
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:19,071
We stopped all his bleeding,

789
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:21,907
but he lost lots of blood,
so his hemoglobin count is low.

790
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,991
He needs blood now.

791
00:51:23,075 --> 00:51:24,826
Are his vitals stable?

792
00:51:25,494 --> 00:51:28,163
We managed to stabilize him
by using dopamine and IV,

793
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:29,873
but we can't let our guard down.

794
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:32,084
We're in need of blood,

795
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:36,004
but the patient has a rare blood type,
so it's not easy to do.

796
00:51:36,088 --> 00:51:38,048
If you can't let your guard down,

797
00:51:38,674 --> 00:51:40,175
does that mean he could die?

798
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:42,719
Without blood,

799
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,888
you'll have to be prepared for the worst.

800
00:51:45,806 --> 00:51:47,808
The worst? How much time does he have?

801
00:51:48,934 --> 00:51:50,769
A few hours at most.

802
00:51:51,937 --> 00:51:53,272
Is he Rh negative?

803
00:51:53,355 --> 00:51:55,023
He's O Rh negative.

804
00:51:55,774 --> 00:51:58,527
We're putting the word out
for an emergency transfusion,

805
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,778

What's your blood type?

809
00:52:23,594 --> 00:52:25,596
He'll die due to lack of blood.

810
00:52:27,097 --> 00:52:28,265
Is that my fault?

811
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,517
He was attacked by a guy whom he arrested.

812
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:32,519
What the heck is your blood type?

813
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:38,025
Attention, please.
We're in dire need of O negative blood.

814
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:40,527
Please find a medical staff
if you can donate blood.

815
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:42,446
-No way.
-What does she mean?

00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,621

00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:55,334

Darn it.

822
00:53:13,935 --> 00:53:14,853
Yes?

823
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:17,898

We'll find the blood, right?

838
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:30,429
His blood pressure is dropping.
So is his pulse.

00:54:50,115 --> 00:54:51,575
He's showing V-fib, doctor.

848
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:52,951
-200 joules.
-What now?

849
00:54:53,034 --> 00:54:54,077
Cleared. Shock!

850
00:54:54,536 --> 00:54:55,704
-200 joules.
-Charged.

853
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:06,882
Why are you here?

854
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:08,592
I came because I was worried.

855
00:55:09,676 --> 00:55:12,387
You're moving right away.
You can't live here.

856
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:14,014
What if we don't?

857
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:16,933
You can't find cheaper housing
compared to this area.

858
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,187
I'll be more careful.

859
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,105
You can go back and study.

860
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:25,317
Don't get bad grades and kicked out.

since you saw him at the terminal?

864
00:55:34,993 --> 00:55:37,204
If you ever run into him,
you know what to do.

865
00:55:37,788 --> 00:55:39,080
Don't even look that way.

866
00:55:39,164 --> 00:55:40,540
Hey.

867
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:41,917
Don't look.

868
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,084
Okay.

869
00:55:45,504 --> 00:55:48,173
He deserves to be killed
by getting fried in feces.

870
00:55:48,757 --> 00:55:50,592
I can't move since poverty is my crime.

871
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:52,886
-Run along then.
-Okay.

872
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:53,804

875
00:56:27,963 --> 00:56:31,466
I can't believe we couldn't find
one person with O Rh negative blood type.

876
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,635
Those we know
are too far from the hospital.

877
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:35,262
What if the worst happens?

878
00:56:36,555 --> 00:56:37,764
Please excuse me then.

879
00:56:38,515 --> 00:56:39,558
Okay.

880
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:44,187
I doubt he's in his right mind.

881
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:46,731
The autopsy is probably underway.

882
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:50,944
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

883
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:14,217
-We still have no blood?
-Not yet.

884
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,556
What if he really changes places
with Professor Yang?

885
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,933
-He must've been after the inheritance.
-What?

886
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:23,018
What inheritance?

887
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:24,936
Money is a good reason for murder.

888
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:28,356
Inheritance lawsuits are the dirtiest,
you know.

889
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:35,572
Look at his scary eyes.

890
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:37,449
-Let's go.
-Okay.

891
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:40,994
Be careful not to be found dead.

892
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:55,300
I was a bit late.

893
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:58,136
I should've put it back
before the police came.

894
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,306
If I gave it to them,
the evidence wouldn't be admissible.

895
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:03,850
Even if you gave it to them,

896
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:05,352
it'd pass as solid evidence

897
00:58:05,435 --> 00:58:07,979
unless the police made you
steal this from me.

898
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:15,946
I'll wait and see what you'll do with it.

899
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:18,323
Right.

900
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:20,492
Is the autopsy over?

901
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,085
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

902
00:58:31,002 --> 00:58:32,545
No, that's not what I meant.

903
00:58:33,964 --> 00:58:34,965
I'll call you later.

904
00:58:35,882 --> 00:58:37,008
What happened?

905
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,176
To my office, please.

906
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,012
Was there damage in his brain?

907
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:04,995
Is Yang Jong-hoon in a bad state?

908
00:59:06,788 --> 00:59:07,622
Who's this?

909
00:59:07,706 --> 00:59:09,374
This is disappointing.

910
00:59:09,457 --> 00:59:11,876
You punched me
and made me lose valuable blood.

911
00:59:16,172 --> 00:59:19,009
I heard he's as good as dead
unless I give him my blood.

912
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:20,176
What should I do?

913
00:59:22,095 --> 00:59:23,513
Why are you asking me?

914
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:26,891
Who'd benefit the most
if Yang Jong-hoon dies

915
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:29,644
and shuts his mouth for good?

916
00:59:30,437 --> 00:59:32,981
If that's you, I won't give him my blood.

917
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:46,161
I already told you.
I'm here right now thanks to your uncle.

918
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,289
O RH NEGATIVE NEEDED NOW

919
00:59:49,372 --> 00:59:51,791
So? Should I give him my blood or not?

920
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:09,684
Don't do a thing, and stay still.

921
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,941
Don't give him your blood.

922
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:05,990
Professor Yang is in critical condition?

923
01:01:06,074 --> 01:01:08,868
He could actually die
without a transfusion!

924
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:10,161
He won't last.

925
01:01:10,245 --> 01:01:11,871
Did you push him on purpose?

926
01:01:11,955 --> 01:01:13,581
Will you let me go if I tell you?

927
01:01:13,665 --> 01:01:15,417
That punk scares me.

928
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,127
Any chance that it was manipulated?

929
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,255
Unless he was ordered to frame him
for drugging the victim to death.

930
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:23,258
All these circumstances and evidence
are pointing to Joon-hwi.

931
01:01:23,341 --> 01:01:24,759
I killed him.

932
01:01:24,843 --> 01:01:27,137
Something must've gone wrong.
This can't be.

933
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,972
What if we lose both of them?

934
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:32,684
Joon-hwi submitted his withdrawal letter
this morning.

935
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:33,685
I can't reach him.

936
01:01:33,768 --> 01:01:35,979
The prosecution delivered
some shocking news.

937
01:01:36,062 --> 01:01:39,858
