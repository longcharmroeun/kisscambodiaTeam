MARCH 2, 2020
HANKUK LAW SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:10,519
2020 HANKUK UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

3
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:24,492
<i>When I failed to overturn my conviction,</i>
<i>I thought the law could kill me.</i>

4
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,661
<i>However, the law did not betray my trust.</i>

5
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:31,290
<i>The donation I'm making</i>
<i>to Hankuk University, my alma mater,</i>

6
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:36,462
<i>is my way of apologizing to the law,</i>
<i>which I questioned for a moment.</i>

7
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,134
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,094
I'm sorry. My gosh!

9
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,138
You two again?

10
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,765
I sat between you at orientation.

11
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:53,729
Seo Ji-ho?

12
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:57,858
And Min Bok-gi, right?

13
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,444
From what I recall, I'm older than you.

14
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,948
Yeah, sis.

15
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,207
Sorry.

16
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,793
It can be tiring to sit next to me.

17
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:20,297
Those guys who are staring at me…
they're wasting their time.

18
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:23,884
I'm taken.

19
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:25,511
MY HUBBY

20
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,346
Babe, I'll call you when I'm done.

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,686
CONGRATULATIONS

22
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:34,854
What? 5.6 billion won?

23
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,815
You'll give that much to Hankuk Law?

24
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,734
-I'm donating it.
-Right, but why?

25
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:44,905
-Why would you donate to them?
-You should do it too.

26
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,242
Now that the judicial exam
has been abolished,

27
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,286
we should help law schools
cultivate talent.

28
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,206
Cultivate talent, my foot.

29
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,917
I know it's too late for me now…

30
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:02,882
but I decided to do it
when the Supreme Court acquitted me.

31
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:07,052
Also because of Jong-hoon,
who became a professor because of us.

32
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,221
Not because of your nephew?

33
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:13,517
What are you thinking?

34
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:18,480
Don't go all crazy
because your son didn't get in.

35
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,943
How could I not be upset?

36
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:27,823
I have to give a congratulatory speech
when my son won't even be there.

37
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:30,367
That idiot.

38
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,828
The girl he's seeing got in,

39
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,496
but he didn't.

40
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,296
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

41
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,341
Byeol, bring this. You can come with Mom.

42
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm late. See you!

43
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:47,218
Okay.

44
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:51,263
Is this really a law school?

45
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,098
Maybe she's fooling us.

46
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:56,018
It's such a mystery.

47
00:03:56,644 --> 00:04:00,648
How did that troublemaker
get into law school?

48
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,483
I'd believe Dan, but…

49
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,196
Sol can do it too.

50
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,451
Maybe she lucked out and got in.

51
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,328
But will she do well here?

52
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,998
I heard the smartest kids in the country
go to this school.

53
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,209
This is it.

54
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,882
Now, the 11th class
of Hankuk University Law School

55
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,177
will take the oath of admission.

56
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,474
Ms. Kang Sol will take the oath
on behalf of the newly admitted students.

57
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,643
Ms. Kang, please come to the podium.

58
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,861
<i>There is another newly admitted student</i>
<i>with the same name.</i>

59
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:49,697
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

60
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:06,046
Nice to see you here, Prosecutor Yang.

61
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,883
Oh, you're not a prosecutor anymore.

62
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:11,885
Right, Professor Yang?

63
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,310
You're in no position to say anything
to future judicial officers.

64
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:25,149
You still can't accept the fact
that it was a gift, not a bribe?

65
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:34,867
As a law professor
who teaches criminal law,

66
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:38,871
you shouldn't hold a grudge
against the Supreme Court's decision.

67
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:43,417
I wouldn't call it a grudge.

68
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:45,878
It's doubt.

69
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,719
Have you seen Kang Dan since then?

70
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:24,625
He won't last.

71
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,418
-What about the blood?
-Not yet.

72
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:35,302
-Prof. Yang is in critical condition?
-You didn't get the text?

73
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,773
My little sister is Rh negative, so I know

74
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,191
how rare it is.

75
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,194
He could actually die
without a transfusion!

76
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,870
Sir! Please let me out!

77
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,873
He could die.

78
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,750
-He won't die.
-Hold on.

79
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,502
-Wait! Let me go!
-Professor Yang

80
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:09,545
will be okay.

81
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,275
<i>Do not give it to him.</i>

82
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,154
<i>Don't give him your blood.</i>

83
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:39,283
<i>Okay, then will you give me</i>
<i>half of your inheritance?</i>

84
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,376
He'll really be okay, right?

85
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,588
<i>He's passed the critical stage,</i>
<i>so he'll recover soon.</i>

86
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,716
Thank goodness.

87
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,343
Okay.

88
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,931
They found a donor,
so he has received a transfusion.

89
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,106
You were right.

90
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:15,736
I told you he'd be okay.

91
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,409
Hey, you're drunk.

92
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:23,702
You should go to bed.

93
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:26,038
Come on.

94
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,386
INVESTIGATION AND TRIAL

95
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,305
I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE FACTS ARE TRUE

96
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:47,809
Ji-ho.

97
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:51,021
Would you write a complaint?

98
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,946

<i>Hey, Joon-hwi.</i>

I have to study. Hey!

00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,299
Get up. Hey, get up!

104
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,176
Get up.

105
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,720
Gosh, what's taking him so long?

106
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,056
4 ATTACHMENTS

107
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:27,766
Jeez.

AUTOPSY REPORT

109
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:37,776
What's up? I'm a busy guy.

110
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,571
<i>Luckily, you got a transfusion,</i>
<i>so you're okay now.</i>

111
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,325
It must've been hard
to find Rh-negative blood.

112
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,744
You were lucky.

113
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,371
We found a donor at the last minute.

114
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,874
I don't know who it is,
but we should thank the donor

115
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,083
for saving his life.

116
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,086
Recovering quickly is one way to do it.

117
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,839
We never disclose our blood donors.

118
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:43,050
Well, get some rest, then.

119
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,054
Whatever.

120
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,393
You lucked out and regained
your consciousness for a reason.

121
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:54,353
Can you see it?

122
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,189
Gosh, hold on a second.

123
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:03,862
It's rare to find a brain hematoma

124
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,031
in a second autopsy.

125
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:10,661
But Professor Seo Byung-ju's wife
hired a top medical examiner and--

126
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:14,581
So it's not that they missed it.
They deliberately left it out, right?

127
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:15,666
Bingo.

128
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,504
SECOND AUTOPSY REPORT

129
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:22,506
SUSPECTED TO HAVE DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSE

130
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,675
SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE CAUSED BY A FALL
CANNOT BE RULED OUT

131
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,678
Apparently, the first medical examiner
quit and left the country.

132
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,808
His son is in Canada,
so he went there to get cancer treatment,

133
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:33,934
but I can't reach him.

134
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,019
His family all left with him.

135
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:40,816
So we can't ask him
why the brain damage was left out?

136
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,025
That's right.

137
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:43,318
Gosh, this is nuts.

138
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,279
Now there are two likely causes of death.

139
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:49,658
Darn it.

140
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,213
PLEASE RECYCLE

141
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,716
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

142
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,683
How can you eat now?

143
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,942
Professor Yang nearly died because of you.
Professor Seo too.

144
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,071
You give me the creeps. Get out.

145
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,784
Do you think I'm the killer?

146
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:34,828
Yes.

147
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:40,250
Why not suggest that I turn myself in
as a good roommate should?

148
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,543
You'll turn yourself in?

149
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,753
Then do it before the final exams.

150
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,425
I can get an A plus
if you drop out before then.

151
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,302
Oh, because of your grades?

152
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,387
Like you said, as a good roommate should.

153
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,181
You said I creep you out.

154
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:57,017
If you do that for me,
I'll take back the comment.

155
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:03,315
Hey.

156
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,901
Why give me a case that won't even pay…

157
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,111
Darn it!

158
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:12,115
Because of it, I may even have to take on
the attempted murder case!

159
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,119
Is it him?

160
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:19,789
Can I talk to him?

161
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,170
Who ordered you to do it?

162
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,048
<i>Look at you, Professor Yang.</i>

163
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,425
<i>You still got it.</i>

164
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:36,139
<i>Do I look like a loser</i>
<i>who just carries out orders?</i>

165
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:38,808
Got an attorney yet?

166
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,480
Need a recommendation?

167
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:45,482
<i>What?</i>

168
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,109
My public defender.
He says my case won't pay much.

169
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,279
Spend the money you've made
from being a loan shark.

170
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,283
Pay him good money, and he'll get
your sentence drastically reduced.

171
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,326
When did I say that?

172
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,161
Bodily harm, not attempted murder.

173
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,248
What? For real?

174
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,374
<i>Bodily harm?</i>

175
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,379
You stabbed me due to a personal grudge
but weren't trying to kill me.

176
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:22,143

About my mark--

180
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,527
I said no disputes will be accepted.

181
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,404
May I check my answer sheet?

182
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:35,574
I need to know what I got wrong
to do better on the finals.

183
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,245
Just a minute.

00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,569
Let's go study.

193
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,201
I want to read it.

194
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,411
There's nothing to read.

195
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:22,871
Prof. Kang has one too.

196
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:25,457
I thought he hated you,

197
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,584
but he even read your dissertation.

198
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,127
What dissertation? This?

199
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,256
-Wow, you won the grand prize?
-Grand prize?

200
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,801
"Asia Human Rights Dissertation Contest"?

201
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:39,971
My gosh!
Why didn't I write one in undergrad…

202
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,557
Read it.
You want to be a human rights lawyer.

203
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,476
Can I make a copy of this? Let's all--

204
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,560
No, forget it.

205
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,149
I'm looking for Han Joon-hwi
in first year…

206
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,581
Just talk it out, or I'll call the cops.

207
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:13,964
You killed my husband for the inheritance?

208
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,764
How could you have the audacity
to walk around the campus?

209
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:26,726
My gosh!

210
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,561
Are you okay, ma'am?

211
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,029
Why did you do that?

212
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:40,448
Why do you think your uncle

213
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,703
made the donation and built the mock court
even though I tried so hard to stop him?

214
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:47,580
How… How could you…

215
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:52,210
kill your uncle?

That jerk stabbed you.
How could you ask me to represent him?

218
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,026
He'll pay you good money.
He's a loan shark and has a lot of cash.

219
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,486
Still, from attempted murder
to bodily harm?

220
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,448
-Can I really do it?
-Yeah.

221
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,452
There's something, right?

222
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:33,043
How are you feeling?
So you miraculously found a donor?

223
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:36,629
He's recovering quickly.

224
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:38,256
That's great.

225
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:40,967
That being said,
you should get out on sick bail

226
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:43,261
before you fully recover.

227
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,807
Got anything to say?

228
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:48,808
Sorry?

229
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,810
As my attorney.

230
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,104
Oh…

231
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:54,606
Well…

232
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:55,899
How should I be released?

233
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:57,192
On sick bail?

234
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,197
Well…

235
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,365
Sick bail…

236
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,576
-Apply for it.
-No.

237
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,787
Cancel the arrest warrant.

238
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:12,040
-You actually know things.
-Jong-hoon.

239
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:15,251
Looks like you also need to explain
why that needs to be done.

240
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:18,963
Well, if he's released on sick bail,
it'll be a temporary release.

241
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,465
It doesn't quash the warrant--

242
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,301
-I obviously know--
-Of course, I'm sure you know.

243
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:27,013
But it'll be embarrassing for you
to reverse the decision you had…

244
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,100
We'll make the request.

245
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,018
No, you should do it yourself.

246
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:33,603
Let's just do it ourselves.

247
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:36,606
If he has to get it canceled himself,
it'll be so awful--

248
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,982
I want you to do it.

249
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:43,154
Is this because of the second autopsy?

250
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,657
You have no reason to detain me,

251
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,368
so get it canceled.

252
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,040
He was after his money?

253
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:57,752
That's why he killed his uncle
who practically raised him?

254
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:02,465
I witnessed it with my own eyes.
He refused to sign the renunciation form.

255
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,342
Families can be torn apart over money.

256
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,177
Blood may be thicker than water,

257
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:07,887
but money comes first.

258
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,682
You're not in our study group.

259
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,226
Don't jump to conclusions.

260
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,145
I'm not jumping to conclusions here.

261
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:18,606
All these circumstances and evidence
are pointing to Joon-hwi.

262
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,484
There's plenty of evidence
pointing to Professor Yang.

263
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,073
Oh, are you hoping
Professor Yang is the killer--

264
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:28,825
I just hope it's not Joon-hwi.

265
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:48,803
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

266
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,393
You don't deserve to teach here.

267
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,478
Joon-hwi.

268
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,566
The prosecutor I admired the most
betrayed his principles.

269
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,652
And my beloved uncle…

270
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,989
hit a kid with his car and killed him.

271
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:10,241
My whole world collapsed.

272
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,122
I sent the video to Professor Yang.

273
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:20,460
What?

274
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,881
Turn yourself in now,
before he reports it to the police.

275
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:27,759
How could you do this?

276
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,053
Please get out of the gutter now.

277
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,479
You ungrateful brat.

278
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,571

00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:55,161

281
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,915
How does it feel to be released?

282
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,959
-You didn't kill him?
-Step aside.

283
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,253
-Please, another time.
-Move back.

284
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,420
Out of the way!

285
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:09,342
If you're that curious,

286
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,221
ask the prosecutor who leaked info
about my charges before indictment.

287
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:15,139
Nothing has changed.

288
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,560
BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

289
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:23,606
However, he's seriously injured
and requires medical treatment,

290
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,817
which means he is not likely to flee,

291
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,236
so I've concluded
he doesn't need to be detained.

292
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:34,117
As a prosecutor, I also have to protect

293
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,204
the accused's rights
for the sake of public interest.

294
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:39,998
-Out of the way.
-Why are you here?

295
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,084
-A comment, please.
-No, out of the way.

296
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:47,213
I had arrested him on reasonable grounds,

297
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:49,465
but he suffered an injury
while in custody,

298
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,759
so I came here out of concern.

299
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,595
But he's not well,
so please try not to bother him.

300
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,973
He said you'd leaked info
about his alleged crime.

301
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,142
-Is it true?
-No, of course not.

302
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:00,518
My job is to protect…

303
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:03,021
Read this since you're here anyway.

304
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:14,657
I'm going to sue Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u

305
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,993
for publicizing facts
about my alleged crime.

306
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,915
He'll be the first prosecutor
to be indicted and prosecuted

307
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,418
for publicizing facts
about an alleged crime.

308
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,295
-Mr. Jin.
-Do you admit to it?

309
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,254
Is it true?

310
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:29,964
-Tell us the truth.
-Just a comment!

311
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,098
I'll doze off with my eyes open.

312
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:41,934
Professor Jung Dae-hyeon's lectures
are like sleeping pills.

313
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,269
Just take them online.

315
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,067
-What?
-What's going on?

316
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,652
-Hey, look.
-What is happening?

317
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,279
Why is he here?

319
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,710
Kim Cheol-su, a student,

320
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:10,630
went to the restroom
while out on a date with his girlfriend.

321
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,551
Upon returning, he witnessed Park
sexually assaulting his girlfriend.

322
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:19,305
So he punched him in the face
and told him to let her go.

323
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:22,600
Insisting that he did not
sexually assault her,

324
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:24,936
Park argued with Kim
and punched him in the end.

325
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:29,941
Park continued to play innocent,
and Kim punched him back out of anger.

326
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,652
They were both charged with assault.

327
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:35,196
Kim insisted that he had acted
in self-defense, but…

328
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,454
You over there, in sunglasses.

329
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,542
I'm sorry. I've got a sty.

330
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,835
The Court's decision?

331
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:49,752
Pardon?

332
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,923
Well, the Supreme Court…

333
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:56,259
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:59,345
I came unprepared thinking
Prof. Jung was giving the lecture.

335
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:00,638
You didn't do the reading?

336
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:04,350
I was going to do it,
but you suddenly got arrested.

337
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,894
So you thought you didn't have to do it.

338
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:10,148
Then you shouldn't be here. Get out.

339
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,357
Professor Yang.

340
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,401
If you didn't do the reading, get out.

341
00:24:17,363 --> 00:24:19,824
He's even scarier
now that he's been stabbed.

342
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:20,867
-Professor.
-Sol A.

343
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,451
The Supreme Court's decision?

344
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:23,369
Pardon?

345
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:29,458
Oh, they didn't accept Kim's claim
that he had acted in self-defense.

346
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,376
Why not?

347
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,253
They concluded that it was a fight.

348
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,255
Why can't a fight be ruled self-defense?

349
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,301
Self-defense is a countermeasure
against unfair harm done to oneself,

350
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:40,887
whereas a fight is a forcible encounter.

351
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,805
He was trying to save his girlfriend.

352
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:44,974
Isn't it a permissible act
of self-defense?

353
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:49,645
Then Kim Cheol-su should have--

354
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,981
He should've stopped
after punching Park once.

355
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:55,526
-Why is that?
-Because the act of punching Park back

356
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,280
in retaliation
is considered an act of self-defense

357
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,991
and an attack at the same time.
It's mutual combat.

358
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,118
Is that right?

359
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,460
Do you really think so?

360
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,470
Only the first time he punched Park
is considered an act of self-defense?

361
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,305
And the sexual assault stopped?

362
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:25,389
Yes.

363
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:29,185
After that,
they argued and got into a fight.

364
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:32,438
-Said the Court. What about you?
-Sorry?

365
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:34,523
I think…

366
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,903
to not be seen as mutual combat…

367
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,949
Kim shouldn't have fought back.
Then he could've sued him for assault.

368
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,078
You seem annoyed.

369
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,332
I'll try to understand
the Court's decision.

370
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:54,252
You should question it
instead of trying to understand it.

371
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:55,795
Pardon?

372
00:25:58,297 --> 00:26:02,051
<i>He'll be the first prosecutor</i>
<i>to be indicted and prosecuted</i>

373
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:04,345
<i>for publicizing facts</i>
<i>about an alleged crime.</i>

374
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,597
<i>-Mr. Jin.</i>
<i>-Do you admit to it?</i>

375
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,266
<i>-Can we have your comment?</i>
<i>-Please.</i>

376
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:09,600
<i>Just a comment, please.</i>

377
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:10,977
<i>-Do you admit to it?</i>
<i>-Do--</i>

378
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,524
I won't ask twice.

379
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,026
Did you push him on purpose?

380
00:26:21,737 --> 00:26:23,281
Will you let me go if I tell you?

381
00:26:23,906 --> 00:26:24,949
What?

382
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:26,742
I've got class.

383
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,791
The Supreme Court's decisions
can be overturned.

384
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:35,501
Don't just complain about it.

385
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,421
Question it and persevere
until you find the answer.

386
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:42,758
Han Joon-hwi.

387
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,186
As you're all probably aware,
Joon-hwi and I

388
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,064
are suspects in the murder
of Professor Seo Byung-ju.

389
00:26:58,065 --> 00:27:01,360
They say I made him overdose,
and Joon-hwi pushed him down the stairs.

390
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,029
Let's say that's a fact.

391
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:06,157
If he died from a brain hemorrhage
caused by a fall,

392
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,034
what should our charges be?

393
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:11,412
It'll depend on whether
what Joon-hwi did was intentional.

394
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,831
-If it was an accident?
-Negligence causing death.

395
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:15,374
As for you, attempted murder.

396
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,293
-If he died of an overdose?
-Murder.

397
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,004
For Joon-hwi,
negligence causing bodily harm.

398
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:22,214
It cannot be prosecuted
if the victim objects.

399
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:24,508
The deceased victim
can't demand your punishment,

400
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,385
so you won't be charged.

401
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:29,013
-If he died of an overdose?
-Seriously?

402
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,222
He won't be charged?

403
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:32,600
That is not true.

404
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,063
It doesn't mean I'll only be indicted
if the victim

405
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:38,981
wishes to press charges against me.

406
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:42,485
It means I'll be let off if the victim
doesn't want me to be charged.

407
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:46,655
In fact, due to the absence of the victim…

408
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,282
EXPRESSION OF UNWILLINGNESS

409
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,658
…I'll be charged regardless.

410
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:50,868
TO PUNISH

411
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:51,952
You still got it.

412
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,414
I need your consent
for the next assignment.

413
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:59,126
Put yourself in the prosecutor's shoes

414
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,004
and determine which one of us
is more suspicious

415
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,298
based on legal principles and evidence.

416
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,719
I've already uploaded all the materials
you'll need, but keep in mind

417
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:10,262
they're confidential documents.

418
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:11,889
CRIMINAL CODE

419
00:28:11,972 --> 00:28:13,682
-Seriously?
-I can't believe this.

420
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:22,316
Compare the two?

421
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,819
Nothing can faze Yangcrates.

422
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:25,778
He's invincible.

423
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,947
Negligence charges can be dropped?

424
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,156
It's not just an injury.

425
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,491
But it lacks intent.

426
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,202
If you inflicted bodily injury,
it was intentional.

427
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:35,538
But it probably wasn't intentional.

428
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:36,914
CIVIL CODE

429
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:39,625
CIVIL CODE

430
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,336
CIVIL CODE

431
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:44,213
Oh, dear.

432
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:47,758
You all look frazzled, like zombies.

433
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:50,553
Clearly, Yangcrates is back.

434
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,015
I'm sorry, but I do need to talk to you
about your marks.

435
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,227
I've e-mailed it to you individually,

436
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,857
so make an appointment to see me
in my office.

437
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,150
-Okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

438
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,901
All right, let's begin.

439
00:29:06,402 --> 00:29:08,821
Seven million dollars!

440
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:13,033
A little mistake led to a massive loss.

441
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:16,495
Let's first go over this damage case
that took place in the US.

442
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:20,166
-I thought you'd be crying somewhere.
-This happened

443
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:24,336
-I'd rather get kicked out and breathe.
-at an American dairy company in 2014.

444
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,797
The employees who were in charge
of shipping out…

445
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,257
So what's the assignment?

446
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,176
They sued the company

447
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:33,304
for unpaid wages…

448
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:40,686
"Do not disgrace
the scales of Lady Justice."

449
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:45,649
That's what your uncle told me

450
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,860
when I met him for the first time
as a probie.

451
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,282
<i>Prosecutors punish those</i>
<i>who have committed criminal acts.</i>

452
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:55,201
CONVERSATION WITH A PROSECUTOR

453
00:29:55,284 --> 00:29:58,120
More accurately speaking,
a prosecutor's job

454
00:29:58,704 --> 00:30:02,750
is to make sure no one is left
feeling wronged by enforcing the law.

455
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:04,960
Isn't he a hotshot prosecutor?

456
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,630
He even put a business magnate
behind bars.

457
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:08,672
Whose dad is he?

458
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:13,636
"Once a bad person, always a bad person."

459
00:30:14,637 --> 00:30:16,889
To not fall prey
to such bias or prejudice,

460
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:18,182
she wears a blindfold.

461
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:20,851
To create a world where
"one law for the rich

462
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:23,354
and another for the poor"
is simply not allowed,

463
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:25,815
she holds this sword.

464
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:31,111
When someone breaks the law,
even if it's the president,

465
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:34,490
your teacher, or your family,
it shouldn't matter.

466
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,201
Put the person on this scale

467
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:41,956
so he or she can be punished fairly
according to the law.

468
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,668
HAN JOON-HWI

469
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:48,045
That is a true prosecutor.

470
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,638
<i>"Be fair…</i>

471
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,016
so no one will be left feeling wronged."

472
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,228
That's what my uncle said…

473
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:09,650
but he covered up the accident
and wronged the victim even after death.

474
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:18,701
You should've caught him.

475
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:24,039
When he deemed Lee Man-ho feebleminded,
you should've caught on.

476
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:27,334
You should've suspected him
when he insisted the bribe was a gift.

477
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:32,923
If only he had been arrested…

478
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:42,933
Did I do it?

479
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,445
Turn yourself in.

480
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,280
Get out of my way.

481
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:02,620
Why don't you just kill me?

482
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,168
EMERGENCY NUMBER

483
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,462
Just kill me!

484
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:13,130
Turn yourself in now!

485
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:22,973
Uncle.

486
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:26,101
Uncle!

487
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:31,565
<i>911.</i>

488
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,942
-Is this 911?
-<i>Please speak.</i>

489
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,985
I'm at Hankuk Law's mock court.

490
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,571
My professor fell down the stairs
and went unconscious.

491
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,697
<i>Is he breathing?</i>

492
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:40,366
One second.

493
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:42,201
-Uncle.
-Hello?

494
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,756
Uncle, are you all right?

495
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:14,942
Uncle.

496
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:16,360
Are you okay?

497
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:22,366
Yeah, I'm fine.

498
00:33:24,994 --> 00:33:26,412
Just let me give this lecture.

499
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:30,165
You hit your head hard.
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

500
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,596
I should've just taken him
to the hospital.

501
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:56,650
FACTS ABOUT YANG JONG-HOON'S
SUSPECTED CRIME

502
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,903
FACTS ABOUT HAN JOON-HWI'S
SUSPECTED CRIME

503
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,449
Comparing who's more suspicious?

504
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:04,950
Isn't it so cruel?

505
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:08,037
You didn't know
how cruel Professor Yang was?

506
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,414
I take it back.

507
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:13,584
He's not really cruel.
He's awfully persistent.

508
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:17,463
I'd benefited from it once.

509
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:20,340
What do you mean?

510
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,259
If I tell you,

511
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:24,928
will you call me "Sis"?

512
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:30,517
When did it begin?

513
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,728
Had I known you had feelings for Joon-hwi,

514
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:34,938
I wouldn't have been so friendly with him.

515
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:37,566
I must've really irked you.

516
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:39,526
You were upset about being Sol B--

517
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,737
Not at all,
because you're no match for me.

518
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:45,407
So?

519
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,117
Who's more suspicious?

520
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,496
I know how you feel,
but based on evidence?

521
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:54,416
Overdose versus brain hemorrhage
caused by a fall.

522
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,585
If we determine
the immediate cause of death--

523
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,170
It won't be easy.

524
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,464
You don't die right away
from a hemorrhage.

525
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:02,257
In many cases, it takes a while.

526
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:04,259
Drugs too. It takes time to be absorbed.

527
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,013
Shouldn't the NFS determine
the immediate cause of death?

528
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,015
I know the director of the NFS very well.

529
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:13,644
Seriously, I'm not lying.

530
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,854
This case would be a headache
even for him.

531
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:18,816
All right.

532
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:22,861
I should curry favor with our future
judges, prosecutors, and lawyers.

533
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:24,530
Here, have some. Take a break.

534
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:26,824
Take a break.

535
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:29,827
Here, have some.

536
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,797
I don't bribe just about anyone.
With you two, it's more like almsgiving.

537
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,634
How do you know if these will be bribes
or alms down the road?

538
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:47,386
You got a 28. And you, 29.

539
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:48,846
I see.

540
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:52,558
Don't pull your hair out, though.

541
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:53,475
You'll go bald.

542
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,477
You don't need to pull your hair out

543
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:58,021
because I don't care.

544
00:36:00,315 --> 00:36:02,901
I brought my exam notes.
Feel free to use them.

546
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:08,407

What do you mean?

548
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,082
The immediate cause is unknown.

549
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:19,710
I really don't care.

550
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:21,628
I care.

551
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,718
I killed him.

SUSPECT YANG JONG-HOON, EVIDENCE

554
00:36:57,581 --> 00:37:00,500
The DNA test results,
which are the most reliable evidence,

555
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,628
show that the hair
found in the victim's hand

556
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:05,422
-belongs to Professor Yang Jong-hoon--
-Hey.

557
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,257
Just say "Professor Yang."

558
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:09,718
The hair belongs to Mr. Yang.

559
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:12,262
If he gave him coffee with sugar
because he was showing

560
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:14,306
symptoms of low blood sugar, it's possible

561
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:17,267
that he grabbed Yang's hair
during his hypoglycemic shock.

562
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:21,939
HAN JOON-HWI, EVIDENCE

563
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,148
MOTIVE

564
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:24,316
DETAILS OF CRIME

565
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,568
As for Mr. Han, the most decisive evidence

566
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:29,738
-is that he switched the glasses--
-How will you prove it?

567
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:32,074
I saw him bringing the pair
without a nose pad

568
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:34,493
from the scene
and hiding it in the dorm room.

569
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,995
But you didn't see him switch the glasses.

570
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:38,747
Only state facts.

571
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,084
Then take out the part
about him switching the glasses.

572
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,545
Joon-hwi, can't you just tell us
what you did?

573
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:48,382
I told you guys to only stick
to the evidence we have.

574
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,262
To be honest, I don't understand
why we have to do this.

575
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:54,554
I do not want

576
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:56,807
to put either Mr. Yang or Mr. Han
on the scales.

577
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:05,274
The issue about Joon-hwi's suspected crime
is not if he switched the glasses,

578
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,487
but if he pushed Seo
on purpose or accidentally.

579
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:16,076
<i>Answer my question.</i>

580
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,870
<i>He tried to stop me</i>
<i>from calling the police,</i>

581
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:21,248
then he tripped
and rolled down the stairs.

582
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,417
Hey, why are you telling us this just now?

583
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,627
You should've told us
before we let Yang go.

584
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:29,339
Why are you defending yourself now?
Why didn't you do this sooner?

585
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:31,842
The more you suspect me,

586
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:34,469
the less reason you'll have
to keep him detained.

587
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:37,681
So you did this on purpose?

588
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,602
Because you wanted
to help him get released?

589
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,533
Was it because you wanted me
to return to school soon?

590
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,883
He passed the second-round judicial exam.
Why apply to law school?

591
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:10,093
That punk scares me.

592
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:11,762
He used one sneaky trick.

593
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:17,559
He's about to get locked up
because of Yang Jong-hoon.

594
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:18,769
I can't believe

595
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:21,104
he made people suspect him
just to help Yang.

596
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:22,898
He got us good this time.

597
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,747
You can't determine
the immediate cause of death?

598
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,706
We need to know…

599
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,584
01 PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

600
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,129
Then which one is the most likely cause…

601
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:49,091
Fine, all right.

602
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:54,805
Why don't we consult other experts,
not just medical examiners?

603
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:58,058
Everyone says it's not easy
to pick one as the cause of death.

604
00:39:58,141 --> 00:39:59,893
Jeez, what a mess.

605
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,353
Without the second autopsy…

606
00:40:03,438 --> 00:40:06,858
There's a renowned American
forensic pathologist named Johns Patrol.

607
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:08,402
I'll contact him for help.

608
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:11,196
Why can't we figure out the cause?

609
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:13,949
What if we lose both of them?

610
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:15,826
That won't happen.

Have you interviewed the accused yet?

616
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:39,599
You seem to be doing great.

617
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:43,353
Investigate the case swiftly
and thoroughly.

618
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:48,316
I hope you're curious as to why I'm here.

619
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:50,861
I have a rare blood type.

620
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,697

and saved a man's life.

622
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,327
I wanted to see if he was alive and well.

623
00:41:03,457 --> 00:41:05,083
Looks like he's doing very well.

624
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:12,215
Anyone with a conscience would never

625
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:15,051
deliberately sabotage someone
who saved their life.

626
00:41:15,677 --> 00:41:17,888
For example,
trying to dig up dirt on someone

627
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:21,808
with a proven alibi
who has clearly turned over a new leaf.

This can't be.

00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:46,476
They didn't give you a zero

You got the highest mark.

00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:56,319
-Did the marks get switched?
-Maybe.

You won't get an A plus.

698
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:30,765

At first, I also wrote that it was false
but changed my answer

706
00:45:47,824 --> 00:45:48,992
because of the comma.

707
00:45:49,075 --> 00:45:50,243
-Comma?
-Where?

708
00:45:50,827 --> 00:45:52,871
I noticed the comma between

709
00:45:52,954 --> 00:45:55,540
"received a donation from B"
and "hired B as a professor."

710
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,586
-My gosh.
-It wasn't in Joon-hwi's petition.

711
00:46:00,253 --> 00:46:03,298
The comma means
that the statements about his donation

712
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:05,008
and appointment are both true.

713
00:46:06,342 --> 00:46:08,219
-My gosh.
-I didn't even notice it.

714
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,262
Darn it.

715
00:46:11,014 --> 00:46:13,475
You failed to identify it
and correctly apply the law.

716
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:14,434
Any other comments?

717
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:15,894
-No, sir.
-Nothing?

718
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:18,104
Pardon? Oh, I'm sorry.

719
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:21,733
I assumed it'd be exactly the same
as Joon-hwi's petition,

720
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:22,775
so I missed it.

721
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,986
Prejudgment can be like a deadly poison.

722
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:26,821
-Anything else?
-Well…

723
00:46:26,905 --> 00:46:30,950
I should always be alert and focused
as one comma can turn false information

724
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:32,452
-into facts--
-Then tell me.

725
00:46:32,535 --> 00:46:35,246
If what A wrote is true,
should he be found guilty?

726
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,459
In Korea, it can be considered an offense
even if the statement

727
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:41,211
-is a fact--
-So is he guilty?

728
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:44,005
No, I wrote that
he should be found not guilty.

729
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:47,425
Why?

730
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:49,177
Article 310 of the Criminal Code.

731
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,514
Even if it's a fact-based
defamatory statement,

732
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:55,517
the act is not punishable
if the facts are true

733
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,268
and solely for the public interest.

734
00:46:57,352 --> 00:46:58,895
It was for the public interest,

735
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:01,147
-so it is justified.
-Yes.

736
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:02,273
Joon-hwi, I mean…

737
00:47:02,357 --> 00:47:06,444
A put up the petition demanding the school
clear suspicions surrounding

738
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:09,948
the donation and the hiring process
and collected signatures

739
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:12,659
because he was acting
in the public interest as a student--

740
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,410
He could've had a personal agenda.

741
00:47:14,494 --> 00:47:16,454
A and B are related but were on bad terms.

742
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,541
Here's the Supreme Court's decision
on Case 98D2188.

743
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:22,126
"If the primary objective
was for the public interest,

744
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,213
Article 310 of the Criminal Code
cannot be ruled out

745
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:27,590
even if there was
a personal agenda involved."

746
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:29,300
So he's not guilty.

747
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:32,428
-Gosh.
-What the…

748
00:47:33,137 --> 00:47:34,347
She's very smart.

749
00:47:41,312 --> 00:47:44,065
How could a criminal be allowed
to write questions

750
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:46,943
for the Criminal Code exam
and even mark them?

751
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:50,029
He's still just a suspect.

752
00:47:50,113 --> 00:47:51,239
He's not a criminal.

753
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:55,201
A professor was arrested
and charged with murder.

754
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:57,620
That, in and of itself,
is an utter embarrassment.

755
00:47:57,704 --> 00:47:59,789
This exam was so important
to the students--

756
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:09,799
You can speak with the vice dean about it.

757
00:48:10,383 --> 00:48:11,426
Her kid's in 1L.

758
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:15,054
You can speak with me.

759
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:18,725
Let's talk in front of the dean.

760
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:22,687
You don't have any power.

761
00:48:24,397 --> 00:48:27,275
I gave Professor Yang permission
to write exam questions.

762
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:29,277
So you can speak with me.

763
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:35,783
Turns out no one noticed the comma.

764
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,410
Except for me!

765
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:40,163
Yes. I've become a celebrity
because of that comma.

766
00:48:40,788 --> 00:48:42,790
I got the highest mark in my class.

767
00:48:42,874 --> 00:48:45,460
Kang Byeol! I'm not lying.

768
00:48:47,128 --> 00:48:48,338
I'll call you later.

769
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:49,547
Excuse me!

770
00:48:51,215 --> 00:48:52,717
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

771
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:57,889
Hello, I'm a Hankuk Law student.

772
00:48:57,972 --> 00:48:59,766
Didn't you conduct the second autopsy?

773
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,477
I told the prosecutors everything.
Excuse me.

774
00:49:03,478 --> 00:49:05,063
Any chance that it was manipulated?

775
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,733
I heard no one can reach
the first medical examiner.

776
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:13,321
And the camera happened to break that day.
Hence, no photos or videos.

777
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,698
I saw this while doing my homework.

778
00:49:15,782 --> 00:49:18,951
He was accused of manipulating one
10 years ago.

779
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:24,540
There's no way he had missed
what you found.

780
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:26,376
If he saw it, why did he leave it out?

781
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,087
Unless he was ordered
to frame my professor

782
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,464
for drugging the victim to death.

783
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:37,345
That's enough. He'd never do that.

784
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,192
CITIZENS' POLICE

785
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:53,486
How did the interview go?

786
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,697
HAPPY CITIZENS

787
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,948
It wasn't a big deal.

788
00:49:58,574 --> 00:50:00,993
But thanks to you, I'm "the accused" now.

789
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:03,413
-Did they treat you like a suspect?
-Of course not.

790
00:50:03,496 --> 00:50:05,289
I'm a prosecutor. How dare they--

791
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:08,126
Drop that attitude and get with the times.

792
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:11,295
-I'll submit evidence, so you'll--
-What? Be indicted?

793
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:13,464
You've just been indicted.

794
00:50:15,216 --> 00:50:16,676
I guess you haven't heard.

795
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:18,511
I've notified the school.

796
00:50:19,262 --> 00:50:21,139
-You're trying too hard.
-Not really.

797
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:25,601
I bet you thought the two likely causes
of death would be a problem.

798
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:27,395
But you were wrong.

799
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:30,231
Both you and Han Joon-hwi
have been indicted.

800
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:33,151
As joint principal offenders.

801
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:34,110
JOINT OFFENDERS

802
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:35,945
That is one groundless conclusion.

803
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:37,488
It's not groundless.

804
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:40,867
Han Joon-hwi used such a sneaky trick
to get you out.

805
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,161
If you weren't in on it together,
why would he…

806
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,329
go to such lengths?

807
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:47,373
Oh, right.

808
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,460
I'm leaking info again, aren't I?

809
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:57,675
Everyone at the school seems shocked.

810
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,263
Get a lawyer who used to be
a judge or prosecutor this time.

811
00:51:09,812 --> 00:51:12,982
The prosecution delivered
some shocking news earlier today.

812
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,903
Professor Yang and Han Joon-hwi
have been indicted

813
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:19,363
as joint principal offenders
in the murder.

814
00:51:20,198 --> 00:51:21,115
Pardon me?

815
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:22,575
"Joint principal offenders"?

816
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,453
I'm sure you're all shocked by the news.

817
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:26,871
Ms. Oh.

818
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,374
I rushed to call this meeting

819
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:34,462
to inform you of the school's decision
regarding Professor Yang.

820
00:51:34,545 --> 00:51:36,589
This indictment makes no sense.

821
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:38,216
They're joint offenders?

822
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:40,927
Are they writing a novel?

823
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,430
That is for the judge to decide.

824
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:47,892
Even with the presumption of innocence,

825
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:50,645
if Professor Yang continues to teach,

826
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:53,064
it'll lead to more unwanted problems.

827
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:56,192
So he'll be removed from his position.

828
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:57,401
-What?
-Gosh.

829
00:51:57,485 --> 00:51:58,778
-Seriously?
-Oh, boy.

830
00:51:58,861 --> 00:51:59,987
Will that be enough?

831
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:03,115
Shouldn't he be fired?

832
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,992
Isn't it almost the same thing?

833
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:07,829
Telling him that he can't teach.

834
00:52:07,912 --> 00:52:09,163
No, it's different.

835
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:11,290
He can keep his professor title.

836
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:15,628
He can't teach the Criminal Code course
anymore.

837
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:19,006
Professor Jung,
please continue to fill in.

838
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,593
As for Joon-hwi,
I'll have the vice dean take over.

839
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:27,265
Joon-hwi submitted his withdrawal letter
this morning.

840
00:52:32,478 --> 00:52:33,813

YANG JONG-HOON

845
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,933
REMOVED FROM CURRENT POSITION
AS OF OCTOBER 26, 2020

846
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:12,101
"Removed"?

847
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:14,186
They were both indicted
as joint offenders.

848
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,356
It means they planned the murder together
from the get-go.

849
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:21,444
We should've seen the whole picture
instead of comparing them.

850
00:53:21,527 --> 00:53:23,321
-This is crazy.
-My gosh!

851
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:25,865

They dug him up
for the second autopsy,

874
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:25,230
so burying him again was--

875
00:55:25,313 --> 00:55:26,982
You observed the second autopsy.

876
00:55:28,483 --> 00:55:29,317
Yes, I did.

877
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:32,320
Were there really signs of bleeding
in his brain?

00:55:40,954 --> 00:55:42,080
Go help her.

881
00:55:49,087 --> 00:55:50,589
Because it was too gruesome?

882
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:52,090
Was it not just an act?

883
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:54,134
What are you talking about?

884
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,803
What are you implying?

885
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:06,855
<i>Didn't you put on an act to give them time</i>
<i>to manipulate the results?</i>

886
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:16,573
Come on. Hurry.

887
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,784
What are you suspicious of?

888
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:21,078
-You said you know the director well.
-I sure do!

889
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:22,662
-My gosh.
-Long time no see.

890
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,166
The results from the first
and second autopsies don't add up.

891
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,335
I briefly talked to them about the things

892
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,836
that I don't understand.

893
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,547
The examiner just said the usual things,
but his assistant…

894
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:34,841
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

895
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:38,220
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

896
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:57,781
They were photos of another corpse,
not Professor Seo.

897
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:00,075
That's not true.

898
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,745
The examiner recorded
this phone conversation.

899
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,956
Shall I play it in front of him?

900
00:57:11,753 --> 00:57:14,881
I said the cause of death has to be
brain hemorrhage from a fall.

901
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,758
I never told you to whip up two causes!

902
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:18,093
I said it's not true!

903
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,557
What's with that glare?

904
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,392
I didn't do it.

905
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:27,561
It wasn't me!

906
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,192
Okay, thank you.

907
00:57:35,026 --> 00:57:37,404
The NFS asked them
to launch an investigation,

908
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,573
so the examiner and the wife
have been booked.

909
00:57:40,198 --> 00:57:42,367
Oh, no. Joon-hwi must be shocked.

910
00:57:42,451 --> 00:57:45,328
It proves that he's innocent,
so he should call it even.

911
00:57:45,412 --> 00:57:47,706
I'm impressed that you pulled this off.

912
00:57:48,206 --> 00:57:49,708
All the digging has paid off.

913
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,794
Joon-hwi managed to clear his name,
but Prof. Yang…

914
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,755
Indictment isn't a joke.

915
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,341
Take responsibility for indicting us
as joint offenders.

916
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:01,803
You practically wrote a novel.

917
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:04,181
You should attend my lecture
on joint offenders.

918
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,480
Your charges will be dropped.

919
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,529
I've been dismissed.

920
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:26,786
WITHDRAWAL FORM

921
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,141
You didn't kill him either.

922
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,310
Is there evidence to prove it?

923
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:52,687
Had you been the killer,

924
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:55,565
you wouldn't have gotten Sol A
to check Lee Man-ho's alibi.

925
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:58,652
Maybe I was trying to dump it on him
because I'm the killer.

926
00:58:59,194 --> 00:59:00,570
My alibi hasn't been proven.

927
00:59:01,154 --> 00:59:02,197
Still, I think--

928
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,741
If there's no evidence,
it's just an assumption,

929
00:59:04,824 --> 00:59:05,909
which is unlike you.

930
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:07,410
The sugar packet--

931
00:59:07,494 --> 00:59:09,371
I'm glad they know you didn't take it.

932
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:15,460
I'm glad…

933
00:59:20,882 --> 00:59:21,758
that you survived.

934
00:59:31,893 --> 00:59:33,395
Wait, just a second.

935
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:34,354
<i>Too bad.</i>

936
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,107
<i>I'm O Rh negative. But today, I lost</i>

937
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:38,567
<i>some of my valuable blood.</i>

938
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,071
<i>My blood is valuable.</i>

939
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,616
Can you get his number?

940
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:48,535
RARE BLOOD COMMUNITY

941
00:59:56,585 --> 00:59:58,044
WE NEED O RH NEGATIVE

942
01:00:01,256 --> 01:00:02,549
Do not give it to him.

943
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,262
Sure, if that's what you want.

944
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,765
Okay, then will you give me
half of your inheritance?

945
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:13,310
I can't agree to that.

946
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,188
Then I should give him my blood.

947
01:00:18,106 --> 01:00:19,274
I know you won't.

948
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,651
If Prof. Yang dies just like that,

949
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,362
you'd benefit more than I would.

950
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,448
<i>You really think so?</i>

951
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,576
You're in quite a mess yourself.

952
01:00:32,078 --> 01:00:34,623
So I have no reason
not to donate my blood to him.
