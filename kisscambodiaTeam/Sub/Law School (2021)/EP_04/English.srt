MARCH 2, 2020
HANKUK LAW SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:24,928
2020 HANKUK UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

3
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:38,901
When I failed to overturn my conviction,
I thought the law could kill me.

4
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,070
However, the law did not betray my trust.

5
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:45,699
The donation I'm making
to Hankuk University, my alma mater,

6
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:50,871
is my way of apologizing to the law,
which I questioned for a moment.

7
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,543
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

8
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,503
I'm sorry. My gosh!

9
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,547
You two again?

10
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,174
I sat between you at orientation.

11
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:08,138
Seo Ji-ho?

12
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:12,267
And Min Bok-gi, right?

13
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:14,853
From what I recall, I'm older than you.

14
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,357
Yeah, sis.

15
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:27,616
Sorry.

16
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,202
It can be tiring to sit next to me.

17
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:34,706
Those guys who are staring at me…
they're wasting their time.

18
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,293
I'm taken.

19
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:39,920
MY HUBBY

20
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,755
Babe, I'll call you when I'm done.

21
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,095
CONGRATULATIONS

22
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:49,263
What? 5.6 billion won?

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,224
You'll give that much to Hankuk Law?

24
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,143
-I'm donating it.
-Right, but why?

25
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:59,314
-Why would you donate to them?
-You should do it too.

26
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,651
Now that the judicial exam
has been abolished,

27
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,695
we should help law schools
cultivate talent.

28
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:08,615
Cultivate talent, my foot.

29
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,326
I know it's too late for me now…

30
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:17,291
but I decided to do it
when the Supreme Court acquitted me.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,461
Also because of Jong-hoon,
who became a professor because of us.

32
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,630
Not because of your nephew?

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,926
What are you thinking?

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,889
Don't go all crazy
because your son didn't get in.

35
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,352
How could I not be upset?

36
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:42,232
I have to give a congratulatory speech
when my son won't even be there.

37
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,776
That idiot.

38
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,237
The girl he's seeing got in,

39
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:48,905
but he didn't.

40
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:56,705
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

41
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:59,750
Byeol, bring this. You can come with Mom.

42
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,709
I'm late. See you!

43
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:01,627
Okay.

44
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:05,672
Is this really a law school?

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,507
Maybe she's fooling us.

46
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,427
It's such a mystery.

47
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:15,057
How did that troublemaker
get into law school?

48
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,892
I'd believe Dan, but…

49
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:21,605
Sol can do it too.

50
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,860
Maybe she lucked out and got in.

51
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,737
But will she do well here?

52
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:32,407
I heard the smartest kids in the country
go to this school.

53
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:34,618
This is it.

54
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:41,291
Now, the 11th class
of Hankuk University Law School

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,586
will take the oath of admission.

56
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:49,883
Ms. Kang Sol will take the oath
on behalf of the newly admitted students.

57
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,052
Ms. Kang, please come to the podium.

58
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:02,270
There is another newly admitted student
with the same name.

59
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:04,106
Keep this in mind.

60
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:20,455
Nice to see you here, Prosecutor Yang.

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,292
Oh, you're not a prosecutor anymore.

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,294
Right, Professor Yang?

63
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:33,719
You're in no position to say anything
to future judicial officers.

64
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,558
You still can't accept the fact
that it was a gift, not a bribe?

65
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,276
As a law professor
who teaches criminal law,

66
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:53,280
you shouldn't hold a grudge
against the Supreme Court's decision.

67
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,826
I wouldn't call it a grudge.

68
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:00,287
It's doubt.

69
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,128
Have you seen Kang Dan since then?

70
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,034
He won't last.

71
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,827
-What about the blood?
-Not yet.

72
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:49,711
-Prof. Yang is in critical condition?
-You didn't get the text?

73
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:02,182
My little sister is Rh negative, so I know

74
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:03,600
how rare it is.

75
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,603
He could actually die
without a transfusion!

76
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,279
Sir! Please let me out!

77
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:19,282
He could die.

78
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:21,159
-He won't die.
-Hold on.

79
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:22,911
-Wait! Let me go!
-Professor Yang

80
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:23,954
will be okay.

81
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:45,684
Do not give it to him.

82
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:49,563
Don't give him your blood.

83
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,692
Okay, then will you give me
half of your inheritance?

84
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,785
He'll really be okay, right?

85
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,997
He's passed the critical stage,
so he'll recover soon.

86
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,125
Thank goodness.

87
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:12,752
Okay.

88
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,340
They found a donor,
so he has received a transfusion.

89
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:25,515
You were right.

90
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,145
I told you he'd be okay.

91
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,818
Hey, you're drunk.

92
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,111
You should go to bed.

93
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:40,447
Come on.

94
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,795
INVESTIGATION AND TRIAL

95
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,714
I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE FACTS ARE TRUE

96
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:02,218
Ji-ho.

97
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,430
Would you write a complaint?

98
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,355

HAN JOON-HWI

101
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:28,620
Hey, Joon-hwi.

102
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:31,414
I have to study. Hey!

103
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:33,708
Get up. Hey, get up!

104
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,585
Get up.

105
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:38,129
Gosh, what's taking him so long?

106
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,465
4 ATTACHMENTS

107
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:42,175
Jeez.

AUTOPSY REPORT

109
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,185
What's up? I'm a busy guy.

110
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:36,980
Luckily, you got a transfusion,
so you're okay now.

111
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:40,734
It must've been hard
to find Rh-negative blood.

112
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,153
You were lucky.

113
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:45,780
We found a donor at the last minute.

114
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:48,283
I don't know who it is,
but we should thank the donor

115
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:49,492
for saving his life.

116
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:52,495
Recovering quickly is one way to do it.

117
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,248
We never disclose our blood donors.

118
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,459
Well, get some rest, then.

119
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:01,463
Whatever.

120
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,802
You lucked out and regained
your consciousness for a reason.

121
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:08,762
Can you see it?

122
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:11,598
Gosh, hold on a second.

123
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:18,271
It's rare to find a brain hematoma

124
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:20,440
in a second autopsy.

125
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:25,070
But Professor Seo Byung-ju's wife
hired a top medical examiner and--

126
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:28,990
So it's not that they missed it.
They deliberately left it out, right?

127
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:30,075
Bingo.

128
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,913
SECOND AUTOPSY REPORT

129
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,915
SUSPECTED TO HAVE DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSE

130
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:40,084
SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE CAUSED BY A FALL
CANNOT BE RULED OUT

131
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:43,087
Apparently, the first medical examiner
quit and left the country.

132
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:47,217
His son is in Canada,
so he went there to get cancer treatment,

133
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,343
but I can't reach him.

134
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:50,428
His family all left with him.

135
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:55,225
So we can't ask him
why the brain damage was left out?

136
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,434
That's right.

137
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,727
Gosh, this is nuts.

138
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,688
Now there are two likely causes of death.

139
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:04,067
Darn it.

140
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,622
PLEASE RECYCLE

141
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,125
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

142
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,092
How can you eat now?

143
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:38,351
Professor Yang nearly died because of you.
Professor Seo too.

144
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,480
You give me the creeps. Get out.

145
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,193
Do you think I'm the killer?

146
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:49,237
Yes.

147
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:54,659
Why not suggest that I turn myself in
as a good roommate should?

148
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:55,952
You'll turn yourself in?

149
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:58,162
Then do it before the final exams.

150
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,834
I can get an A plus
if you drop out before then.

151
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,711
Oh, because of your grades?

152
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,796
Like you said, as a good roommate should.

153
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,590
You said I creep you out.

154
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:11,426
If you do that for me,
I'll take back the comment.

155
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:17,724
Hey.

156
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,310
Why give me a case that won't even pay…

157
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:22,520
Darn it!

158
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:26,524
Because of it, I may even have to take on
the attempted murder case!

159
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:30,528
Is it him?

160
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:34,198
Can I talk to him?

161
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,579
Who ordered you to do it?

162
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,457
Look at you, Professor Yang.

163
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,834
You still got it.

164
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:50,548
Do I look like a loser
who just carries out orders?

165
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,217
Got an attorney yet?

166
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,889
Need a recommendation?

167
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,891
What?

168
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,518
My public defender.
He says my case won't pay much.

169
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,688
Spend the money you've made
from being a loan shark.

170
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:09,692
Pay him good money, and he'll get
your sentence drastically reduced.

171
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:10,735
When did I say that?

172
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,570
Bodily harm, not attempted murder.

173
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,657
What? For real?

174
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,783
Bodily harm?

175
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:21,788
You stabbed me due to a personal grudge
but weren't trying to kill me.

176
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,552
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

177

DECEMBER 2016

178
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,224
What's up?

179
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,059
About my mark--

180
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,936
I said no disputes will be accepted.

181
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:46,813
May I check my answer sheet?

182
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:49,983
I need to know what I got wrong
to do better on the finals.

183
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:54,654
Just a minute.

192
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:26,978
Let's go study.

193
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,610
I want to read it.

194
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:35,820
There's nothing to read.

195
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:37,280
Prof. Kang has one too.

196
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:39,866
I thought he hated you,

197
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:41,993
but he even read your dissertation.

198
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,536
What dissertation? This?

199
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:47,665
-Wow, you won the grand prize?
-Grand prize?

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,210
"Asia Human Rights Dissertation Contest"?

201
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:54,380
My gosh!
Why didn't I write one in undergrad…

202
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,966
Read it.
You want to be a human rights lawyer.

203
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,885
Can I make a copy of this? Let's all--

204
00:14:58,968 --> 00:14:59,969
No, forget it.

205
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,558
I'm looking for Han Joon-hwi
in first year…

206
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:20,990
Just talk it out, or I'll call the cops.

207
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:28,373
You killed my husband for the inheritance?

208
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:37,173
How could you have the audacity
to walk around the campus?

209
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,135
My gosh!

210
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:42,970
Are you okay, ma'am?

211
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:52,438
Why did you do that?

212
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,857
Why do you think your uncle

213
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:59,112
made the donation and built the mock court
even though I tried so hard to stop him?

214
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,989
How… How could you…

215
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:06,619
kill your uncle?

HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

217
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:25,638
That jerk stabbed you.
How could you ask me to represent him?

218
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,435
He'll pay you good money.
He's a loan shark and has a lot of cash.

219
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,895
Still, from attempted murder
to bodily harm?

220
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:35,857
-Can I really do it?
-Yeah.

221
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,861
There's something, right?

222
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:47,452
How are you feeling?
So you miraculously found a donor?

223
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:51,038
He's recovering quickly.

224
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:52,665
That's great.

225
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:55,376
That being said,
you should get out on sick bail

226
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,670
before you fully recover.

227
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,216
Got anything to say?

228
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,217
Sorry?

229
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,219
As my attorney.

230
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:07,513
Oh…

231
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:09,015
Well…

232
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,308
How should I be released?

233
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:11,601
On sick bail?

234
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:16,606
Well…

235
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,774
Sick bail…

236
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,985
-Apply for it.
-No.

237
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:23,196
Cancel the arrest warrant.

238
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:26,449
-You actually know things.
-Jong-hoon.

239
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:29,660
Looks like you also need to explain
why that needs to be done.

240
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:33,372
Well, if he's released on sick bail,
it'll be a temporary release.

241
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,874
It doesn't quash the warrant--

242
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:37,710
-I obviously know--
-Of course, I'm sure you know.

243
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:41,422
But it'll be embarrassing for you
to reverse the decision you had…

244
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,509
We'll make the request.

245
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:46,427
No, you should do it yourself.

246
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:48,012
Let's just do it ourselves.

247
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:51,015
If he has to get it canceled himself,
it'll be so awful--

248
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:52,391
I want you to do it.

249
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,563
Is this because of the second autopsy?

250
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,066
You have no reason to detain me,

251
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,777
so get it canceled.

252
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,449
He was after his money?

253
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:12,161
That's why he killed his uncle
who practically raised him?

254
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:16,874
I witnessed it with my own eyes.
He refused to sign the renunciation form.

255
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,751
Families can be torn apart over money.

256
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,586
Blood may be thicker than water,

257
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,296
but money comes first.

258
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:25,091
You're not in our study group.

259
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,635
Don't jump to conclusions.

260
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:29,554
I'm not jumping to conclusions here.

261
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:33,015
All these circumstances and evidence
are pointing to Joon-hwi.

262
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,893
There's plenty of evidence
pointing to Professor Yang.

263
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:41,482
Oh, are you hoping
Professor Yang is the killer--

264
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,234
I just hope it's not Joon-hwi.

265
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,212
Turn yourself in.

266
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,802
You don't deserve to teach here.

267
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:11,887
Joon-hwi.

268
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:15,975
The prosecutor I admired the most
betrayed his principles.

269
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:19,061
And my beloved uncle…

270
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,398
hit a kid with his car and killed him.

271
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,650
My whole world collapsed.

272
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:30,531
I sent the video to Professor Yang.

273
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:34,869
What?

274
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:39,290
Turn yourself in now,
before he reports it to the police.

275
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,168
How could you do this?

276
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,462
Please get out of the gutter now.

277
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,888
You ungrateful brat.

278
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,980
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

279
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:09,570
He's coming out!

BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

281
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,324
How does it feel to be released?

282
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,368
-You didn't kill him?
-Step aside.

283
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,662
-Please, another time.
-Move back.

284
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:18,829
Out of the way!

285
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,751
If you're that curious,

286
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:27,630
ask the prosecutor who leaked info
about my charges before indictment.

287
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:29,548
Nothing has changed.

288
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:33,969
BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

289
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:38,015
However, he's seriously injured
and requires medical treatment,

290
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:40,226
which means he is not likely to flee,

291
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,645
so I've concluded
he doesn't need to be detained.

292
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:48,526
As a prosecutor, I also have to protect

293
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:52,613
the accused's rights
for the sake of public interest.

294
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:54,407
-Out of the way.
-Why are you here?

295
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,493
-A comment, please.
-No, out of the way.

296
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:01,622
I had arrested him on reasonable grounds,

297
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,874
but he suffered an injury
while in custody,

298
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,168
so I came here out of concern.

299
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:09,004
But he's not well,
so please try not to bother him.

300
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,382
He said you'd leaked info
about his alleged crime.

301
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:13,551
-Is it true?
-No, of course not.

302
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:14,927
My job is to protect…

303
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,430
Read this since you're here anyway.

304
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:29,066
I'm going to sue Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u

305
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,402
for publicizing facts
about my alleged crime.

306
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:37,324
He'll be the first prosecutor
to be indicted and prosecuted

307
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,827
for publicizing facts
about an alleged crime.

308
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,704
-Mr. Jin.
-Do you admit to it?

309
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:42,663
Is it true?

310
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:44,373
-Tell us the truth.
-Just a comment!

311
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,507
I'll doze off with my eyes open.

312
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:56,343
Professor Jung Dae-hyeon's lectures
are like sleeping pills.

313
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:57,678
Just take them online.

CRIMINAL CODE

315
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:03,476
-What?
-What's going on?

316
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:06,061
-Hey, look.
-What is happening?

317
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:07,688
Why is he here?

318
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,284
CRIMINAL CODE

319
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:22,119
Kim Cheol-su, a student,

320
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:25,039
went to the restroom
while out on a date with his girlfriend.

321
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:29,960
Upon returning, he witnessed Park
sexually assaulting his girlfriend.

322
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:33,714
So he punched him in the face
and told him to let her go.

323
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,009
Insisting that he did not
sexually assault her,

324
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:39,345
Park argued with Kim
and punched him in the end.

325
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:44,350
Park continued to play innocent,
and Kim punched him back out of anger.

326
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,061
They were both charged with assault.

327
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:49,605
Kim insisted that he had acted
in self-defense, but…

328
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,863
You over there, in sunglasses.

329
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,951
I'm sorry. I've got a sty.

330
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,244
The Court's decision?

331
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,161
Pardon?

332
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,332
Well, the Supreme Court…

333
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,668
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,754
I came unprepared thinking
Prof. Jung was giving the lecture.

335
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,047
You didn't do the reading?

336
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,759
I was going to do it,
but you suddenly got arrested.

337
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:21,303
So you thought you didn't have to do it.

338
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,557
Then you shouldn't be here. Get out.

339
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,766
Professor Yang.

340
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,810
If you didn't do the reading, get out.

341
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:34,233
He's even scarier
now that he's been stabbed.

342
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:35,276
-Professor.
-Sol A.

343
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,860
The Supreme Court's decision?

344
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:37,778
Pardon?

345
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:43,867
Oh, they didn't accept Kim's claim
that he had acted in self-defense.

346
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:44,785
Why not?

347
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:46,662
They concluded that it was a fight.

348
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,664
Why can't a fight be ruled self-defense?

349
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,710
Self-defense is a countermeasure
against unfair harm done to oneself,

350
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:55,296
whereas a fight is a forcible encounter.

351
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,214
He was trying to save his girlfriend.

352
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:59,383
Isn't it a permissible act
of self-defense?

353
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:04,054
Then Kim Cheol-su should have--

354
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:06,390
He should've stopped
after punching Park once.

355
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:09,935
-Why is that?
-Because the act of punching Park back

356
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,689
in retaliation
is considered an act of self-defense

357
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:16,400
and an attack at the same time.
It's mutual combat.

358
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:18,527
Is that right?

359
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:26,869
Do you really think so?

360
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,879
Only the first time he punched Park
is considered an act of self-defense?

361
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:38,714
And the sexual assault stopped?

362
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:39,798
Yes.

363
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:43,594
After that,
they argued and got into a fight.

364
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:46,847
-Said the Court. What about you?
-Sorry?

365
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,932
I think…

366
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:53,312
to not be seen as mutual combat…

367
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:57,358
Kim shouldn't have fought back.
Then he could've sued him for assault.

368
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:01,487
You seem annoyed.

369
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,741
I'll try to understand
the Court's decision.

370
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:08,661
You should question it
instead of trying to understand it.

371
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:10,204
Pardon?

372
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:16,460
He'll be the first prosecutor
to be indicted and prosecuted

373
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,754
for publicizing facts
about an alleged crime.

374
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:21,006
-Mr. Jin.
-Do you admit to it?

375
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,675
-Can we have your comment?
-Please.

376
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:24,009
Just a comment, please.

377
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:25,386
-Do you admit to it?
-Do--

378
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:30,933
I won't ask twice.

379
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,435
Did you push him on purpose?

380
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:37,690
Will you let me go if I tell you?

381
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:39,358
What?

382
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,151
I've got class.

383
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:48,200
The Supreme Court's decisions
can be overturned.

384
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,910
Don't just complain about it.

385
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,830
Question it and persevere
until you find the answer.

386
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,167
Han Joon-hwi.

387
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:08,595
As you're all probably aware,
Joon-hwi and I

388
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,473
are suspects in the murder
of Professor Seo Byung-ju.

389
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:15,769
They say I made him overdose,
and Joon-hwi pushed him down the stairs.

390
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,438
Let's say that's a fact.

391
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:20,566
If he died from a brain hemorrhage
caused by a fall,

392
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:22,443
what should our charges be?

393
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,821
It'll depend on whether
what Joon-hwi did was intentional.

394
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:28,240
-If it was an accident?
-Negligence causing death.

395
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:29,783
As for you, attempted murder.

396
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:31,702
-If he died of an overdose?
-Murder.

397
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,413
For Joon-hwi,
negligence causing bodily harm.

398
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:36,623
It cannot be prosecuted
if the victim objects.

399
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,917
The deceased victim
can't demand your punishment,

400
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:40,794
so you won't be charged.

401
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,422
-If he died of an overdose?
-Seriously?

402
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:44,631
He won't be charged?

403
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:47,009
That is not true.

404
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:51,472
It doesn't mean I'll only be indicted
if the victim

405
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:53,390
wishes to press charges against me.

406
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:56,894
It means I'll be let off if the victim
doesn't want me to be charged.

407
00:26:58,395 --> 00:27:01,064
In fact, due to the absence of the victim…

408
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:02,691
EXPRESSION OF UNWILLINGNESS

409
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,067
…I'll be charged regardless.

410
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:05,277
TO PUNISH

411
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,361
You still got it.

412
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:09,823
I need your consent
for the next assignment.

413
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,535
Put yourself in the prosecutor's shoes

414
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,413
and determine which one of us
is more suspicious

415
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:18,707
based on legal principles and evidence.

416
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:23,128
I've already uploaded all the materials
you'll need, but keep in mind

417
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:24,671
they're confidential documents.

418
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,298
CRIMINAL CODE

419
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:28,091
-Seriously?
-I can't believe this.

420
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:36,725
Compare the two?

421
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,228
Nothing can faze Yangcrates.

422
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:40,187
He's invincible.

423
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,356
Negligence charges can be dropped?

424
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,565
It's not just an injury.

425
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:44,900
But it lacks intent.

426
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:47,611
If you inflicted bodily injury,
it was intentional.

427
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,947
But it probably wasn't intentional.

428
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,323
CIVIL CODE

429
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,034
CIVIL CODE

430
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:56,745
CIVIL CODE

431
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:58,622
Oh, dear.

432
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:02,167
You all look frazzled, like zombies.

433
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:04,962
Clearly, Yangcrates is back.

434
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:09,424
I'm sorry, but I do need to talk to you
about your marks.

435
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,636
I've e-mailed it to you individually,

436
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:17,266
so make an appointment to see me
in my office.

437
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:18,559
-Okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

438
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:20,310
All right, let's begin.

439
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:23,230
Seven million dollars!

440
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:27,442
A little mistake led to a massive loss.

441
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:30,904
Let's first go over this damage case
that took place in the US.

442
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,575
-I thought you'd be crying somewhere.
-This happened

443
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:38,745
-I'd rather get kicked out and breathe.
-at an American dairy company in 2014.

444
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:41,206
The employees who were in charge
of shipping out…

445
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,666
So what's the assignment?

446
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:44,585
They sued the company

447
00:28:44,668 --> 00:28:47,713
for unpaid wages…

448
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:55,095
"Do not disgrace
the scales of Lady Justice."

449
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,058
That's what your uncle told me

450
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:02,269
when I met him for the first time
as a probie.

451
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:07,691
Prosecutors punish those
who have committed criminal acts.

452
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,610
CONVERSATION WITH A PROSECUTOR

453
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:12,529
More accurately speaking,
a prosecutor's job

454
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:17,159
is to make sure no one is left
feeling wronged by enforcing the law.

455
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:19,369
Isn't he a hotshot prosecutor?

456
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,039
He even put a business magnate
behind bars.

457
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,081
Whose dad is he?

458
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:28,045
"Once a bad person, always a bad person."

459
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:31,298
To not fall prey
to such bias or prejudice,

460
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,591
she wears a blindfold.

461
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:35,260
To create a world where
"one law for the rich

462
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:37,763
and another for the poor"
is simply not allowed,

463
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,224
she holds this sword.

464
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:45,520
When someone breaks the law,
even if it's the president,

465
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:48,899
your teacher, or your family,
it shouldn't matter.

466
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:51,610
Put the person on this scale

467
00:29:52,194 --> 00:29:56,365
so he or she can be punished fairly
according to the law.

468
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,077
HAN JOON-HWI

469
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,454
That is a true prosecutor.

470
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:12,047
"Be fair…

471
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:15,425
so no one will be left feeling wronged."

472
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:18,637
That's what my uncle said…

473
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:24,059
but he covered up the accident
and wronged the victim even after death.

474
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,110
You should've caught him.

475
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:38,448
When he deemed Lee Man-ho feebleminded,
you should've caught on.

476
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:41,743
You should've suspected him
when he insisted the bribe was a gift.

477
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:47,332
If only he had been arrested…

478
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:57,342
Did I do it?

479
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:08,854
Turn yourself in.

480
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:10,689
Get out of my way.

481
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:17,029
Why don't you just kill me?

482
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:23,577
EMERGENCY NUMBER

483
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,871
Just kill me!

484
00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:27,539
Turn yourself in now!

485
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:37,382
Uncle.

486
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:40,510
Uncle!

487
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:45,974
911.

488
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:47,351
-Is this 911?
-Please speak.

489
00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:49,394
I'm at Hankuk Law's mock court.

490
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:51,980
My professor fell down the stairs
and went unconscious.

491
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,106
Is he breathing?

492
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,775
One second.

493
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:56,610
-Uncle.
-Hello?

494
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,165
Uncle, are you all right?

495
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:29,351
Uncle.

496
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:30,769
Are you okay?

497
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:36,775
Yeah, I'm fine.

498
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:40,821
Just let me give this lecture.

499
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,574
You hit your head hard.
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

500
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,005
I should've just taken him
to the hospital.

501
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:11,059
FACTS ABOUT YANG JONG-HOON'S
SUSPECTED CRIME

502
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:14,312
FACTS ABOUT HAN JOON-HWI'S
SUSPECTED CRIME

503
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:17,858
Comparing who's more suspicious?

504
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,359
Isn't it so cruel?

505
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,446
You didn't know
how cruel Professor Yang was?

506
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:24,823
I take it back.

507
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:27,993
He's not really cruel.
He's awfully persistent.

508
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,872
I'd benefited from it once.

509
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:34,749
What do you mean?

510
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,668
If I tell you,

511
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:39,337
will you call me "Sis"?

512
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:44,926
When did it begin?

513
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,137
Had I known you had feelings for Joon-hwi,

514
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,347
I wouldn't have been so friendly with him.

515
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:51,975
I must've really irked you.

516
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:53,935
You were upset about being Sol B--

517
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:56,146
Not at all,
because you're no match for me.

518
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,816
So?

519
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:01,526
Who's more suspicious?

520
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,905
I know how you feel,
but based on evidence?

521
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,825
Overdose versus brain hemorrhage
caused by a fall.

522
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,994
If we determine
the immediate cause of death--

523
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:12,579
It won't be easy.

524
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:14,873
You don't die right away
from a hemorrhage.

525
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:16,666
In many cases, it takes a while.

526
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,668
Drugs too. It takes time to be absorbed.

527
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:22,422
Shouldn't the NFS determine
the immediate cause of death?

528
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:24,424
I know the director of the NFS very well.

529
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:28,053
Seriously, I'm not lying.

530
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:30,263
This case would be a headache
even for him.

531
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,225
All right.

532
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:37,270
I should curry favor with our future
judges, prosecutors, and lawyers.

533
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:38,939
Here, have some. Take a break.

534
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,233
Take a break.

535
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:44,236
Here, have some.

536
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:56,206
I don't bribe just about anyone.
With you two, it's more like almsgiving.

537
00:34:57,249 --> 00:35:00,043
How do you know if these will be bribes
or alms down the road?

538
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:01,795
You got a 28. And you, 29.

539
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,255
I see.

540
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:06,967
Don't pull your hair out, though.

541
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,884
You'll go bald.

542
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:09,886
You don't need to pull your hair out

543
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,430
because I don't care.

544
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:17,310
I brought my exam notes.
Feel free to use them.

546
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:22,816
You don't care?

00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:29,239
What do you mean?

548
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,491
The immediate cause is unknown.

549
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,119
I really don't care.

550
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:36,037
I care.

551
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,127
I killed him.

SUSPECT YANG JONG-HOON, EVIDENCE

554
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,909
The DNA test results,
which are the most reliable evidence,

555
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:17,037
show that the hair
found in the victim's hand

556
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:19,831
-belongs to Professor Yang Jong-hoon--
-Hey.

557
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:21,666
Just say "Professor Yang."

558
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:24,127
The hair belongs to Mr. Yang.

559
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,671
If he gave him coffee with sugar
because he was showing

560
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,715
symptoms of low blood sugar, it's possible

561
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:31,676
that he grabbed Yang's hair
during his hypoglycemic shock.

00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:36,348
HAN JOON-HWI, EVIDENCE

563
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:37,557
MOTIVE

564
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:38,725
DETAILS OF CRIME

565
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:40,977
As for Mr. Han, the most decisive evidence

566
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:44,147
-is that he switched the glasses--
-How will you prove it?

567
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,483
I saw him bringing the pair
without a nose pad

568
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:48,902
from the scene
and hiding it in the dorm room.

569
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:51,404
But you didn't see him switch the glasses.

570
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,156
Only state facts.

571
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:56,493
Then take out the part
about him switching the glasses.

572
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:59,954
Joon-hwi, can't you just tell us
what you did?

573
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:02,791
I told you guys to only stick
to the evidence we have.

574
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:07,671
To be honest, I don't understand
why we have to do this.

575
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:08,963
I do not want

576
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:11,216
to put either Mr. Yang or Mr. Han
on the scales.

577
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:19,683
The issue about Joon-hwi's suspected crime
is not if he switched the glasses,

578
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:24,896
but if he pushed Seo
on purpose or accidentally.

579
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:30,485
Answer my question.

580
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:33,279
He tried to stop me
from calling the police,

581
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:35,657
then he tripped
and rolled down the stairs.

582
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,826
Hey, why are you telling us this just now?

583
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:40,036
You should've told us
before we let Yang go.

584
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,748
Why are you defending yourself now?
Why didn't you do this sooner?

585
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:46,251
The more you suspect me,

586
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,878
the less reason you'll have
to keep him detained.

587
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:52,090
So you did this on purpose?

588
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:57,011
Because you wanted
to help him get released?

589
00:38:08,273 --> 00:38:10,942
Was it because you wanted me
to return to school soon?

590
00:38:19,284 --> 00:38:22,287
He passed the second-round judicial exam.
Why apply to law school?

591
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,497
That punk scares me.

592
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,166
He used one sneaky trick.

593
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,963
He's about to get locked up
because of Yang Jong-hoon.

594
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,173
I can't believe

595
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:35,508
he made people suspect him
just to help Yang.

596
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:37,302
He got us good this time.

597
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:53,151
You can't determine
the immediate cause of death?

598
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:54,110
We need to know…

00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:56,988
01 PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

600
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:00,533
Then which one is the most likely cause…

601
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:03,495
Fine, all right.

602
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:09,209
Why don't we consult other experts,
not just medical examiners?

603
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:12,462
Everyone says it's not easy
to pick one as the cause of death.

604
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:14,297
Jeez, what a mess.

605
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,757
Without the second autopsy…

606
00:39:17,842 --> 00:39:21,262
There's a renowned American
forensic pathologist named Johns Patrol.

607
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:22,806
I'll contact him for help.

608
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:25,600
Why can't we figure out the cause?

609
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:28,353
What if we lose both of them?

610
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,230
That won't happen.

616
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,003
You seem to be doing great.

617
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:57,757
Investigate the case swiftly
and thoroughly.

618
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:02,720
I hope you're curious as to why I'm here.

619
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:05,265
I have a rare blood type.

620
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:08,101
Recently, I donated blood
and saved a man's life.

HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

622
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:13,731
I wanted to see if he was alive and well.

623
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:19,487
Looks like he's doing very well.

624
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:26,619
Anyone with a conscience would never

625
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:29,455
deliberately sabotage someone
who saved their life.

626
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:32,292
For example,
trying to dig up dirt on someone

627
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:36,212
with a proven alibi
who has clearly turned over a new leaf.

It's 97.

This can't be.

652
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,880
They didn't give you a zero
for handing it in late!

You won't believe this.
You got the highest mark.

You beat Joon-hwi and Seung-jae.

655

Did they get me and B mixed up?

656
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:10,723
-Did the marks get switched?
-Maybe.

You should answer it.

You won't get an A plus.

You may not get an A

You must be out of your mind.

00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:36,077
Only one person wrote the correct answer,

-Why is that correct?
-No idea.

698
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:45,169
The school confirmed that it was false,

699
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:47,046
and even Joon-hwi acknowledged it.

700
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:49,590
The mock trial ruled it
a false defamatory statement.

701
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:52,385
I don't understand why it's a fact.

702

-Me neither.
-Totally.

00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:55,388
-I don't get it.
-It makes no sense!

Why did you think he stated facts?

705
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:01,561
At first, I also wrote that it was false
but changed my answer

706
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:03,396
because of the comma.

00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:04,647

-Where?

00:45:05,231 --> 00:45:07,275
I noticed the comma between

709
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:09,944
"received a donation from B"
and "hired B as a professor."

710
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,990
-My gosh.
-It wasn't in Joon-hwi's petition.

711
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:17,702
The comma means
that the statements about his donation

712
00:45:17,785 --> 00:45:19,412
and appointment are both true.

713
00:45:20,746 --> 00:45:22,623
-My gosh.
-I didn't even notice it.

714
00:45:22,707 --> 00:45:23,666
Darn it.

715
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,879
You failed to identify it
and correctly apply the law.

716
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:28,838
Any other comments?

717
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:30,298
-No, sir.
-Nothing?

718
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:32,508
Pardon? Oh, I'm sorry.

719
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:36,137
I assumed it'd be exactly the same
as Joon-hwi's petition,

720
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,179
so I missed it.

721
00:45:37,263 --> 00:45:39,390
Prejudgment can be like a deadly poison.

722
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:41,225
-Anything else?
-Well…

723
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:45,354
I should always be alert and focused
as one comma can turn false information

724
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:46,856
-into facts--
-Then tell me.

725
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:49,650
If what A wrote is true,
should he be found guilty?

726
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:53,863
In Korea, it can be considered an offense
even if the statement

727
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:55,615
-is a fact--
-So is he guilty?

728
00:45:56,282 --> 00:45:58,409
No, I wrote that
he should be found not guilty.

729
00:46:00,953 --> 00:46:01,829
Why?

730
00:46:01,913 --> 00:46:03,581
Article 310 of the Criminal Code.

731
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:06,918
Even if it's a fact-based
defamatory statement,

732
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,921
the act is not punishable
if the facts are true

733
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,672
and solely for the public interest.

734
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:13,299
It was for the public interest,

735
00:46:13,382 --> 00:46:15,551
-so it is justified.
-Yes.

736
00:46:15,635 --> 00:46:16,677
Joon-hwi, I mean…

737
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:20,848
A put up the petition demanding the school
clear suspicions surrounding

738
00:46:20,932 --> 00:46:24,352
the donation and the hiring process
and collected signatures

739
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:27,063
because he was acting
in the public interest as a student--

740
00:46:27,146 --> 00:46:28,814
He could've had a personal agenda.

741
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:30,858
A and B are related but were on bad terms.

742
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,945
Here's the Supreme Court's decision
on Case 98D2188.

743
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:36,530
"If the primary objective
was for the public interest,

744
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:39,617
Article 310 of the Criminal Code
cannot be ruled out

745
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,994
even if there was
a personal agenda involved."

746
00:46:42,787 --> 00:46:43,704
So he's not guilty.

747
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:46,832
-Gosh.
-What the…

748
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:48,751
She's very smart.

749
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:58,469
How could a criminal be allowed
to write questions

750
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:01,347
for the Criminal Code exam
and even mark them?

751
00:47:02,598 --> 00:47:04,433
He's still just a suspect.

752
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:05,643
He's not a criminal.

753
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:09,605
A professor was arrested
and charged with murder.

754
00:47:09,689 --> 00:47:12,024
That, in and of itself,
is an utter embarrassment.

755
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:14,193
This exam was so important
to the students--

756
00:47:20,825 --> 00:47:24,203
You can speak with the vice dean about it.

757
00:47:24,787 --> 00:47:25,830
Her kid's in 1L.

758
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,458
You can speak with me.

759
00:47:31,335 --> 00:47:33,129
Let's talk in front of the dean.

760
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:37,091
You don't have any power.

761
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,679
I gave Professor Yang permission
to write exam questions.

762
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:43,681
So you can speak with me.

763
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:50,187
Turns out no one noticed the comma.

764
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,814
Except for me!

765
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:54,567
Yes. I've become a celebrity
because of that comma.

766
00:47:55,192 --> 00:47:57,194
I got the highest mark in my class.

767
00:47:57,278 --> 00:47:59,864
Kang Byeol! I'm not lying.

768
00:48:01,532 --> 00:48:02,742
I'll call you later.

769
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:03,951
Excuse me!

770
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,121
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

771
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:12,293
Hello, I'm a Hankuk Law student.

772
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:14,170
Didn't you conduct the second autopsy?

773
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:16,881
I told the prosecutors everything.
Excuse me.

774
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:19,467
Any chance that it was manipulated?

775
00:48:20,384 --> 00:48:23,137
I heard no one can reach
the first medical examiner.

776
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,725
And the camera happened to break that day.
Hence, no photos or videos.

777
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:30,102
I saw this while doing my homework.

778
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:33,355
He was accused of manipulating one
10 years ago.

779
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:38,944
There's no way he had missed
what you found.

780
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:40,780
If he saw it, why did he leave it out?

781
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:43,491
Unless he was ordered
to frame my professor

782
00:48:43,574 --> 00:48:45,868
for drugging the victim to death.

783
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:51,749
That's enough. He'd never do that.

784
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:05,596
CITIZENS' POLICE

785
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:07,890
How did the interview go?

786
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:10,101
HAPPY CITIZENS

787
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,352
It wasn't a big deal.

788
00:49:12,978 --> 00:49:15,397
But thanks to you, I'm "the accused" now.

789
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:17,817
-Did they treat you like a suspect?
-Of course not.

790
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,693
I'm a prosecutor. How dare they--

791
00:49:19,777 --> 00:49:22,530
Drop that attitude and get with the times.

792
00:49:22,613 --> 00:49:25,699
-I'll submit evidence, so you'll--
-What? Be indicted?

793
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:27,868
You've just been indicted.

794
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,080
I guess you haven't heard.

795
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:32,915
I've notified the school.

796
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,543
-You're trying too hard.
-Not really.

797
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:40,005
I bet you thought the two likely causes
of death would be a problem.

798
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:41,799
But you were wrong.

799
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:44,635
Both you and Han Joon-hwi
have been indicted.

800
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:47,555
As joint principal offenders.

801
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:48,514
JOINT OFFENDERS

802
00:49:48,597 --> 00:49:50,349
That is one groundless conclusion.

803
00:49:50,432 --> 00:49:51,892
It's not groundless.

804
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:55,271
Han Joon-hwi used such a sneaky trick
to get you out.

805
00:49:55,354 --> 00:49:57,565
If you weren't in on it together,
why would he…

806
00:49:58,774 --> 00:49:59,733
go to such lengths?

807
00:49:59,817 --> 00:50:01,777
Oh, right.

808
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:04,864
I'm leaking info again, aren't I?

809
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:12,079
Everyone at the school seems shocked.

810
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:16,667
Get a lawyer who used to be
a judge or prosecutor this time.

811
00:50:24,216 --> 00:50:27,386
The prosecution delivered
some shocking news earlier today.

812
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,307
Professor Yang and Han Joon-hwi
have been indicted

813
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,767
as joint principal offenders
in the murder.

814
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:35,519
Pardon me?

815
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:36,979
"Joint principal offenders"?

816
00:50:37,855 --> 00:50:39,857
I'm sure you're all shocked by the news.

817
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,275
Ms. Oh.

818
00:50:43,194 --> 00:50:44,778
I rushed to call this meeting

819
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:48,866
to inform you of the school's decision
regarding Professor Yang.

820
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,993
This indictment makes no sense.

821
00:50:51,076 --> 00:50:52,620
They're joint offenders?

822
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,331
Are they writing a novel?

823
00:50:55,414 --> 00:50:58,834
That is for the judge to decide.

824
00:51:00,211 --> 00:51:02,296
Even with the presumption of innocence,

825
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:05,049
if Professor Yang continues to teach,

826
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:07,468
it'll lead to more unwanted problems.

827
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:10,596
So he'll be removed from his position.

828
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:11,805
-What?
-Gosh.

829
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:13,182
-Seriously?
-Oh, boy.

830
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:14,391
Will that be enough?

831
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:17,519
Shouldn't he be fired?

832
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:19,396
Isn't it almost the same thing?

833
00:51:20,522 --> 00:51:22,233
Telling him that he can't teach.

834
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:23,567
No, it's different.

835
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:25,694
He can keep his professor title.

836
00:51:27,655 --> 00:51:30,032
He can't teach the Criminal Code course
anymore.

837
00:51:30,115 --> 00:51:33,410
Professor Jung,
please continue to fill in.

838
00:51:33,494 --> 00:51:36,997
As for Joon-hwi,
I'll have the vice dean take over.

839
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:41,669
Joon-hwi submitted his withdrawal letter
this morning.

840
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:48,217

846
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:26,505
"Removed"?

847
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:28,590
They were both indicted
as joint offenders.

848
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:31,760
It means they planned the murder together
from the get-go.

849
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,848
We should've seen the whole picture
instead of comparing them.

850
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:37,725
-This is crazy.
-My gosh!

851
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:40,269

You scumbag.

I can't believe you schemed
with Yang Jong-hoon.

00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,828
"Schemed"?

Why did you cremate him?

873
00:54:34,216 --> 00:54:38,220
They dug him up
for the second autopsy,

874
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:39,638
so burying him again was--

875
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:41,390
You observed the second autopsy.

876
00:54:42,891 --> 00:54:43,725
Yes, I did.

877
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:46,728
Were there really signs of bleeding
in his brain?

878
00:54:49,314 --> 00:54:52,025
I couldn't actually observe it
because it was too gruesome.

879
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:53,694
I fainted, so I saw nothing.

880
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:56,488
Go help her.

881
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:04,997
Because it was too gruesome?

882
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,498
Was it not just an act?

883
00:55:07,082 --> 00:55:08,542
What are you talking about?

884
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:11,211
What are you implying?

885
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:21,263
Didn't you put on an act to give them time
to manipulate the results?

886
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:30,981
Come on. Hurry.

887
00:55:31,064 --> 00:55:33,192
What are you suspicious of?

888
00:55:33,275 --> 00:55:35,486
-You said you know the director well.
-I sure do!

889
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:37,070
-My gosh.
-Long time no see.

890
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:40,574
The results from the first
and second autopsies don't add up.

891
00:55:40,657 --> 00:55:42,743
I briefly talked to them about the things

892
00:55:42,826 --> 00:55:44,244
that I don't understand.

893
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:46,955
The examiner just said the usual things,
but his assistant…

894
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,249
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

895
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,628
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

896
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:12,189
They were photos of another corpse,
not Professor Seo.

897
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:14,483
That's not true.

898
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:18,153
The examiner recorded
this phone conversation.

899
00:56:18,862 --> 00:56:20,364
Shall I play it in front of him?

900
00:56:26,161 --> 00:56:29,289
I said the cause of death has to be
brain hemorrhage from a fall.

901
00:56:29,373 --> 00:56:31,166
I never told you to whip up two causes!

902
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,501
I said it's not true!

903
00:56:36,713 --> 00:56:37,965
What's with that glare?

904
00:56:38,048 --> 00:56:39,800
I didn't do it.

905
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:41,969
It wasn't me!

906
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:48,600
Okay, thank you.

907
00:56:49,434 --> 00:56:51,812
The NFS asked them
to launch an investigation,

908
00:56:51,895 --> 00:56:53,981
so the examiner and the wife
have been booked.

909
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:56,775
Oh, no. Joon-hwi must be shocked.

910
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:59,736
It proves that he's innocent,
so he should call it even.

911
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,114
I'm impressed that you pulled this off.

912
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:04,116
All the digging has paid off.

913
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:07,202
Joon-hwi managed to clear his name,
but Prof. Yang…

914
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:10,163
Indictment isn't a joke.

915
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:12,749
Take responsibility for indicting us
as joint offenders.

916
00:57:14,459 --> 00:57:16,211
You practically wrote a novel.

917
00:57:16,295 --> 00:57:18,589
You should attend my lecture
on joint offenders.

918
00:57:24,428 --> 00:57:25,888
Your charges will be dropped.

919
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:33,937
I've been dismissed.

920
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:41,194
WITHDRAWAL FORM

921
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:02,549
You didn't kill him either.

922
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:04,718
Is there evidence to prove it?

923
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:07,095
Had you been the killer,

924
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:09,973
you wouldn't have gotten Sol A
to check Lee Man-ho's alibi.

925
00:58:10,057 --> 00:58:13,060
Maybe I was trying to dump it on him
because I'm the killer.

926
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:14,978
My alibi hasn't been proven.

927
00:58:15,562 --> 00:58:16,605
Still, I think--

928
00:58:16,688 --> 00:58:19,149
If there's no evidence,
it's just an assumption,

929
00:58:19,232 --> 00:58:20,317
which is unlike you.

930
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,818
The sugar packet--

931
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:23,779
I'm glad they know you didn't take it.

932
00:58:28,867 --> 00:58:29,868
I'm glad…

933
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:36,166
that you survived.

934
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:47,803
Wait, just a second.

935
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:48,762
Too bad.

936
00:58:49,388 --> 00:58:51,515
I'm O Rh negative. But today, I lost

937
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:52,975
some of my valuable blood.

938
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:57,479
My blood is valuable.

939
00:58:59,272 --> 00:59:01,024
Can you get his number?

940
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:02,943
RARE BLOOD COMMUNITY

941
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:12,452
WE NEED O RH NEGATIVE

942
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:16,957
Do not give it to him.

943
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:21,670
Sure, if that's what you want.

944
00:59:22,546 --> 00:59:25,173
Okay, then will you give me
half of your inheritance?

945
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,718
I can't agree to that.

946
00:59:29,886 --> 00:59:31,596
Then I should give him my blood.

947
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:33,682
I know you won't.

948
00:59:34,307 --> 00:59:36,059
If Prof. Yang dies just like that,

949
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,770
you'd benefit more than I would.

950
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:40,856
You really think so?

951
00:59:42,232 --> 00:59:43,984
You're in quite a mess yourself.

952
00:59:46,486 --> 00:59:49,031
So I have no reason
not to donate my blood to him.

Bring me the laptop.

You think I can't find you, right?

968
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:37,389
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

969
01:02:08,712 --> 01:02:10,380
I bet you saw that too. I'll go see

970
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:11,923
-the dean tomorrow.
-Prof. Yang!

971
01:02:12,007 --> 01:02:13,925
The one who took the laptop
is the culprit?

972
01:02:14,009 --> 01:02:16,511
You're fired so you can't show up here
ever again.

973
01:02:16,595 --> 01:02:17,846
You look just like her.

974
01:02:17,929 --> 01:02:19,556
Looked like you never come home.

975
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,224
He was watching our house.

976
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:22,225
Want to talk to you.

977
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:24,561
I shouldn't ask though I'm curious.
It's insane.

978
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:26,396
All the suspects are here.

979
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:28,773
Is this why you didn't let us
read your paper?

980
01:02:28,857 --> 01:02:30,358
I heard you'd met with Prof. Seo.

981
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:31,818
Why did you search that?

982
01:02:31,902 --> 01:02:33,820
Whoever dies… I'm not scared of that.

983
01:02:33,904 --> 01:02:36,656
If you did something wrong,
you should pay for it.

984
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,783
If Prof. Seo wanted to take issue with it,

985
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:40,619
would you have wanted to kill him?

986
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,037
Is it me this time?

987
