LAW SCHOOL

2
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,728
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS, CASES
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIOUS

3
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:31,666
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

4
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,852
It's Ye-seul. She's gone.

5
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,730
She probably didn't go too far.

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,655
Yeong-chang.

7
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:46,073
Yeong-chang!

8
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,912
Yeong-chang, no…

9
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:56,208
SOL A

10
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,092
Professor Yang.

11
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:06,927
Ye-seul.

12
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,349
We're behind the dorm
for Hankuk Law School.

13
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,393
We have a patient. Please hurry.

14
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:16,270
Sol, Yeong-chang…

15
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:17,521
We need two ambulances.

16
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:18,730
I'll take her and run.

17
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:20,357
Hankuk Hospital is closer that way.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,734
Ye-seul. Wake up.

19
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:24,111
-Don't come.
-Why not?

20
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,696
Assemblyman Ko will be furious.

21
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,531
She may get arrested at the hospital.

22
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:28,615
Arrested?

23
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:30,242
Then detained too?

24
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,577
If they think
she destroyed evidence or fled.

25
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,092
He's in surgery.

26
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,803
Hello, sir.
It looks like his operation just began.

27
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,224
Where is that brat?

28
00:01:58,312 --> 00:01:59,479
EMERGENCY CENTER

29
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,823
How dare…

30
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:13,952
How dare you.
How dare you do this to my son!

31
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:16,371
-She's a patient.
-Move aside!

32
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,792
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:34,097
Ms. Jeon, let me take you to the station.

34
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,809
May I go
after Yeong-chang's operation is over?

35
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:39,436
Shut up.

36
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,022
-Let's go.
-She's undergoing treatment.

37
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,899
She'll present herself afterwards.

38
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:46,943
"Treatment"? After what she did to my son?

39
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,487
I'm so sorry.

40
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:54,159
-Finish getting your IV.
-What are you doing?

41
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,954
She's not in a state to be questioned,
so she can't go.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,999
What are you doing?

43
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,167
Phone, please.

44
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,215
It is December 5th, 9:40 p.m. now.

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,510
Ye-seul's bag is on the bed.
I'm filming this as is.

46
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,346
And over here, too.

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,014
And this.

48
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:22,354
And this. I'm filming these as is.

49
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:26,066
-You're the witness.
-What are you doing?

50
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:28,860
Proving that
she didn't try to destroy evidence.

51
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,029
You saw everything. We're the witnesses.

52
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,656
I'm not going to be a witness.

53
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,952
You have to do it.
Something happened to Ye-seul.

54
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:43,166
If you won't come with us,
we'll have to arrest you.

55
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:46,086
I'll go.

56
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,921
You aren't going anywhere.

57
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,305
If you're fine,
why weren't you arrested in the act?

58
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,306
You collapsed.

59
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,059
You have a few more tests.
Finish them first.

60
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,394
Professor.

61
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:08,483
Wasn't it embarrassing enough
to arrest and detain me?

62
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,693
You should get a grip.

63
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,321
She took a toll because of the shock,

64
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,824
so once she gets better,
I'll bring her to the station.

65
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,284
Move aside.

66
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,035
I'll arrest you for stopping me.

67
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,580
You deserve to be stopped
if you're abusing your power.

68
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:22,956
What?

69
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:33,675
She's a victim, too.

70
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:37,846
She was trying to stop your son
from spreading a spy cam video.

71
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,185
If she gets interrogated now,

72
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:45,270
there'll be a lot of damage to you, too.

73
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,647
You should hope
your son's operation goes well

74
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:50,108
while keeping his belongings together.

75
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,033
Let her get treated first.

76
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:02,871
I'm on my way to the hospital.

77
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,789
Please ask your wife for help.

78
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:07,667
And you must be studying.
You don't need to come, Seung-jae.

79
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,919
Okay. Goodbye.

80
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,760
-Professor!
-My gosh!

81
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,136
-Goodness!
-Oh, no.

82
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,347
-How many weeks?
-At 22 weeks, 3 days.

83
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,640
Get Dr. Lee now.

84
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:24,309
Dr. Lee's surgery is delayed.
If you're in a hurry…

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,895
Professor, may I take a look?

86
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,316
Your baby's heart is beating well,

87
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,109
and the baby is…

88
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:36,529
having lots of fun.

89
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,531
I see enough amniotic fluid,

90
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:40,575
and your cervical length is fine.

91
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,869
Your uterus looks fine, so…

92
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,537
So I won't have to worry?

93
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:47,249
You aren't bleeding,
but you're mid-pregnancy.

94
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,334
She'll suggest you stay for about a week.

95
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,628
Hey, looking cool.

96
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:53,922
I didn't know you were an OB-GYN doctor.

97
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,510
It seems like you'd be a great doctor.
Why did you go to law school?

98
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,136
Tell me about it.

99
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,306
Even your professor asked
why you quit and went to law school.

100
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,352
You're busy studying

101
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,854
that we only see each other
at times like these.

102
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,444
Your uterus seems to be fine.

103
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,823
You may bleed again
if you strain yourself or get stressed.

104
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,241
Please try to remain calm.

105
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:22,826
And just in case,

106
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,912
why don't you get hospitalized
for about a week and see how you do?

107
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,206
Are you his wife?

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,874
Yes.

109
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,294
I see, you're both OB-GYN doctors.

110
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:34,004
That's what I wanted, too.

111
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,673
But he quit then ran off to law school.

112
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:40,427
What are you doing? Get her admitted.

113
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,344
Okay.

Goodness. What is this?

118
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,612
What? Is it not working?

119
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,530
What's with you?

120
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:01,948
Wait, nothing is working.

121
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:04,117
Goodness. What am I going to do?

122
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:08,121
My gosh, come back. Goodness.

123
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,664
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

124
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:12,917
This file won't open,
then something must have happened.

125
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:13,835
It froze.

126
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:17,339
-May I take a look?
-Can you fix computers?

127
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,178
I didn't get a virus, did I?

128
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:25,138
I hope it's not ransomware.

129
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,223
I pressed that before.

130
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,225
Did you back up important files?

131
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,770
What? I'm going to lose everything?

132
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,313
I think it has a virus.

133
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,693
So? Do you think you can fix it?

134
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:42,155
I'll take a look, but if it doesn't work,
I'll take it to an expert.

135
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:45,367
You need to get some rest,
so you have to lie down.

136
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,411
I mean, if I can't get that fixed…

137
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:51,206
Seung-jae.

138
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,833
I need you to save me yet again.

139
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,335
Please fix that.

140
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:56,670
Okay.

141
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,673

BASIC FACTS OF THE INCIDENT

148
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,130
I could just go alone.

149
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,589
You've got your Civil Code exam.

150
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,426
She's in my study group. I should go.

151
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,178
Aiming for all A pluses again?

152
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,848
Don't make it sound easy.

153
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,599
Do you know how hard it is?

154
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:56,438
What about me?
Don't you think things are hard for me?

155
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,065
Do you know how hard it is
to harvest eggs?

156
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:07,532
Fine. The one who's suffering today
is someone else.

I AGREE TO BE EXAMINED
FOR EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT…

159
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,839
I know it's hard, but…

160
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,259
It wasn't an assault.

161
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:30,597
We were in love.

162
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,808
It's sexual assault to film you secretly.

163
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,727
Please don't put it like that.

164
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:37,854
How…

165
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:41,065
How is spending time with someone I love…

166
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,484
I know it's tough,

167
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:45,361
but you have to look straight
at your situation.

168
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,073
The moment you were forced
to have intercourse

169
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:52,076
and began to hide signs of assault
behind your sunglasses,

170
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:54,204
you couldn't call it love.

171
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:56,623
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:58,917
I can't do it.

173
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,466
Professor,
how did Yeong-chang's surgery go…

174
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,609
The media hasn't caught on.

175
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,779
And his phone and laptop
are already taken care of.

176
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,573
But…

177
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,120
What? Examined for sexual assault?

178
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:37,789
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,966
Did the surgery go well?

180
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:49,676
We did our best,

181
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,971
but we'll have to wait and see
if he'll regain consciousness.

182
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:54,639
You'll have to see?

183
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:57,058
I'll tell you more details
at the director's office.

184
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,393
Give me an answer now!

185
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,478
The director wanted to see you upstairs.

186
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,776
Are you saying he may never wake up?

187
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:08,236
Yeong-chang…

188
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,448
Professor, I can't do this.

189
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,867
How can I do it after doing that to him?

190
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:17,745
It's all right.

191
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,876
If it's too hard to take,
you can cry, okay?

192
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,295
It's all right.

193
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,055
What about Ye-seul?

194
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,516
<i>She's with me. You don't have to come.</i>

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,351
I was on my way right now.

196
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:41,728
<i>You still have tests.</i>

197
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:43,021
<i>Go study.</i>

198
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,941
-But--
<i>-You better not flunk because of my test.</i>

199
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:50,361
Okay. Please look after Ye-seul, ma'am.

200
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:52,905
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,409
This darned test is keeping me away

202
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:57,910
from looking after a friend.

203
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:01,205
It'll be harder for her
if you flunk out because of her.

204
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,166
You just got back?

205
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,001
-Did you do it?
-What?

206
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:08,379
Right, yes. I did as you said.

207
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,214
But do you think

208
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,134
the worst could happen for Ko Yeong-chang?

209
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:14,552
Then Ye-seul might--

210
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,928
Just go study.

211
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:17,221
Your tests aren't over.

212
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,808
Those darned tests, tests, tests!

213
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,185
Darn it!

214
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,811
My gosh.

215
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,203
2020 2ND SEMESTER CIVIL CODE FINAL

216
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,246
ON JULY 1ST, 2016, PARTY B HANDED OVER…

217
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,666
No way. What happened here?

218
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,169
EXERCISE OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS

219
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,462
It's a win for us.

220
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:05,978
2020 2ND SEMESTER CIVIL CODE FINAL

221
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,485
THE DEBTOR MAY EXERCISE HIS RIGHT

222
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,797
I got chills as soon as I saw
the Exercise of Subrogation Rights.

223
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,383
I can't believe your study group
made a right prediction.

224
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:38,678
It's thanks to what Sol A found
on <i>Korea Law Review</i>.

225
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:41,681
She thought we'd get questioned on this
and picked it out.

226
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,976
She looked determined not to flunk out,
and she's on a roll.

227
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:48,521
My study group also went through
all of Prof. Kim's works

228
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,023
but couldn't catch it.

229
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:53,067
Hey, should I switch to your study group?

230
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:54,777
If I join in Ye-seul's place…

231
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:56,738
In Ye-seul's place?

232
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:58,906
I mean, I didn't mean in her place.

233
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:00,783
Well…

234
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:04,078
I mean, if you snatched her
before something like this happened--

235
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:05,580
Will you keep saying that?

236
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:06,789
Snatch who from what?

237
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,875
Why are you getting mad at me?

238
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,712
Pretty girls like Ye-seul
tend to fall more easily for bad guys.

239
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,464
Guys like you in the world of law

240
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:16,966
will get bashed
for lack of gender sensitivity.

241
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,052
What? Bashed? Are you done talking?

242
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,219
Hey, Min Bok-gi!

243
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:30,104
Speak.

244
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,398
I think he hacked into it.

245
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,194
After I saved my midterm draft
in the first semester,

246
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,362
my laptop suddenly broke down,

247
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:39,655
so Seung-jae fixed it.

248
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:44,285
If he saw the folder at that time,
I'm sure he would've been tempted.

249
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,749
The vice dean also asked him
to fix his laptop

250
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:52,126
after he heard that Seung-jae fixed mine.

251
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:55,421
I never asked him,
so he would've sneaked in here.

252
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:56,881
Then in the first semester--

253
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,342
I got a new one in the second semester.

254
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,761
He wanted to hack into the new one,

255
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,972
so that's why
he came to this room secretly?

256
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:08,518
Seung-jae, what happened to you that day?

257
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,521
It's your fault.

258
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:18,236
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,739
Something came up at home.
Please excuse me.

260
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,991
He was flustered at my question,

261
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,576
then he said it was my fault.

262
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,704
I gave him the idea
to hack into these computers.

263
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:30,331
That's how he got all A pluses?

264
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,251
Is this just speculation?

265
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,003
I wouldn't say it's just that.

266
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:38,798
I looked up
Seung-jae's midterm answer sheet again.

267
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:40,716
It's almost perfect,

268
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,885
except for one provision he got wrong.

269
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:47,098
And I also put the same wrong provision

270
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,850
on the answer sheet I made.

271
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,234
ANSWER SHEET

272
00:15:58,901 --> 00:15:59,735
And this is?

273
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,531
Maybe it means his head went blank, too.

274
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,376
<i>Goodness, that jerk.</i>

275
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,337
I'm just frustrated.

276
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,339
He's a smart and good kid.

277
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,049
Hacking is an awful crime.

278
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:23,843
I know that, too.

279
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,804
If only I didn't let him see my laptop…

280
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:31,517
Well, anyway,

281
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,644
even if Seung-jae was here that day,

282
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:37,481
there's no reason to prove the alibi
at this point in time, right?

283
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:40,610
He didn't die right after he got drugged.

284
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,320
He died after some time passed.

285
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:46,866
Their argument is you gave him meth
and came back to the office.

286
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:50,286
Wouldn't it be easier to prove

287
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,205
that you gave him sugar, not drugs?

288
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:53,372
He can do that.

289
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:59,503
2:25 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

290
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:12,892
I saw sugar there
and put it in your coffee.

291
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:15,728
But you never know,
so you should see a doctor.

292
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:17,813
Hypoglycemia can be dangerous.

293
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,196
-I'll see him.
-No, I will.

294
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,907
I'll give him a chance to come clean

295
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,450
and prove your alibi.

296
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:30,451
Can you do it?

297
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,498
He has the smoking gun
that can prove your innocence at once.

298
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,291
If he spills it, he'll die,

299
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,043
but if he doesn't, you will.

300
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,419
It must be killing him.

301
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,424
All right, fine. I'll do it.

302
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:47,969
I will.

303
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,768
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

304
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,355
Professor.

305
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:03,818
I'm here about Dan
now that my tests are over.

306
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,903
You'll find out at the trial tomorrow.

307
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,321
At your trial tomorrow?

308
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:08,823
Yes.

309
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:17,456
Isn't this funny?

310
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:22,336
This mock court should be a sacred place,

311
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,338
but it's made with dirty money

312
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:27,466
from a criminal who killed someone
by accident or on purpose,

313
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,302
be it a bribe or a gift.

314
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,099
What do you think

315
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,269
Professor Seo regrets the most
after his death?

316
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,482
Hitting that child was just an accident.

317
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,861
The moment he ran off
and tried to cover it up,

318
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:49,280
he fell into a trap
he couldn't escape from.

319
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:53,034
It was too late to take responsibility.

320
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:55,411
That's what he'd regret the most.

321
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,753
I hope your empty answer sheet

322
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,547
doesn't mean you give up

323
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,257
but a way you displayed courage.

324
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,554
I'll see you in court.

PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S FOURTH TRIAL

326
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,571
Jeon Ye-seul,
a witness from our previous trial,

327
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:33,866
is now indicted for causing
serious injury on her boyfriend.

328
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:35,659
Her testimony cannot be trusted.

329
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,454
Although Ms. Jeon
witnessed the murder scene,

330
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:41,082
she couldn't tell
because the defendant threatened her.

331
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:44,335
Then her boyfriend convinced her
to come to me to state the truth.

332
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:47,922
I can't believe he's going that far.
He should write a novel.

333
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,091
As soon as her relationship fell apart,

334
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:51,675
she changed her statement

335
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,262
then dared to frame him for filming her
against her will.

336
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,430
Objection!

337
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:58,307
We do not know the fact of the matter--

338
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:01,268
Her trial will reveal
that everything I just said is true.

339
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:02,978
Please consider that,

340
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:04,313
and I'd like to request

341
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:08,692
that you put off the trustworthiness
of her testimony until her trial is over.

342
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:12,405
I'd like to turn in
the arraignment of her charges

343
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:13,572
on injuring a person.

344
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,538
JUDGE

345
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,999
Attorney, will you agree
to have this arraignment as evidence?

346
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,919
If he refuses,
the prosecutor might summon Ye-seul again.

347
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:29,797
The judge might do that directly
with his power.

348
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,340
No way.

349
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:33,300
Her life is already tough.

350
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,803
It'd be too cruel
to have her on the stand again.

351
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:43,853
We do not accept.

352
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,523
I'd like to have
Ms. Jeon Ye-seul as a witness again.

353
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,902
Request accepted.

354
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:53,737
If the judge agreed,

355
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:56,699
does it mean he's suspicious
of the validity of her testimony?

356
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:58,701
The prosecutor's tactic worked.

357
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:00,578
He's trying to destroy the validity

358
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,164
of the testimonies
that benefit Professor Yang.

359
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,296
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

360
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,272
This is an airplane ticket to Boston

361
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,691
dated the same day
the defendant was arrested.

362
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:33,110
It's not a round-trip ticket but one way.

363
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,820
The prosecution points to this

364
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,072
and argues
the defendant was trying to flee

365
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:39,909
after he murdered Mr. Seo Byung-ju.

366
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,412
Defendant. Why were you headed to Boston?

367
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,922
To find someone.

368
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,798
I bought it one-way

369
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,383
because the date of my return

370
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,761
depended on whether
I can find the person or not.

371
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,763
Who were you trying to find?

372
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:03,265
Kang Dan.

373
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,645
<i>How dare he try to bait me.</i>

374
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:10,856
What did you mean by that bait?

375
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:15,152
Kang Dan.

376
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:17,363
"Kang Dan"?

377
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,198
Who is Kang Dan?

378
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:21,617
-That is unrelated to this trial.
-Unrelated?

379
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,826
In that case,

380
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,245
do you admit

381
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:27,831
this airplane ticket cannot be used
as evidence to prove his charges?

382
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:32,169
She was a part of the campaign
for Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

383
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:36,715
She became a whistle-blower of his camp
over spreading fake news of his opponent

384
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,133
then suddenly disappeared.

385
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:39,677
-What?
-Disappeared?

386
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,594
Your Honor.

387
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:43,555
Defendant, refrain from stating
unrelated information.

388
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,015
Delete that.

389
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,184
Please give him restrictions

390
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:50,062
on spreading false information
in front of media personnel.

391
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:53,607
That's a problem of defamation
for the said man,

392
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:56,860
but I do not believe
we must put him on restriction here.

393
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,570
It's not false information.

394
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:02,199
A mysterious disappearance
after whistle-blowing?

395
00:23:02,283 --> 00:23:05,286
She dropped the charges herself
then flew over to the U.S.

396
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:06,996
-What?
-Wait.

397
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,330
How do you know that?

398
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:18,007
I heard it from Prosecutor Seo Byung-ju.

399
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,134
-Seo Byung-ju?
-He heard it from him?

400
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:23,012
-What's going on now?
-From Seo Byung-ju?

401
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:31,729
Ko Hyeong-su.

402
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:39,320
KO HYEONG-SU SPREADING FALSE NEWS
ON HIS OPPONENT

403
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:41,613
PARK JUNG-GIL CHARGED
WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT

404
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:44,366
PARK JUNG-GIL FOUND DEAD AT HOME
AFTER HIS RESIGNATION

405
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:50,998
KO HYEONG-SU'S VIOLATION
OF THE ELECTION ACT FROM A WHISTLE-BLOWER

406
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,500
NO RESULTS

407
00:23:57,421 --> 00:24:00,341
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>if I could send this letter to you,</i>

408
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:02,801
<i>but I still wanted to apologize.</i>

409
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:04,219
<i>Prosecutor Yang,</i>

410
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:07,264
<i>I promised</i>
<i>to never compromise with injustice,</i>

411
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:09,767
<i>but I'm sorry I didn't hold to my words.</i>

412
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,853
<i>I ended up kneeling down</i>
<i>before filthy money.</i>

413
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:15,856
<i>Please do not forgive my betrayal,</i>

414
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,941
<i>stay true to your values,</i>

415
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,611
<i>and make sure</i>
<i>you get Ko Hyeong-su punished.</i>

416
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,950
She knelt down before filthy money?

417
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,749
Why are you here?

418
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,337
I saw the view on your plagiarism.

419
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:40,672
I didn't plagiarize.

420
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,966
But Prof. Yang won't believe it.

421
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:44,885
So?

422
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,138
Do you want to believe
Prof. Yang is the culprit?

423
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:51,683
Is that why you said
you didn't see the sugar packet?

424
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:56,313
Then why are you so sure
that Prof. Yang didn't do it?

425
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:09,076
I was with him.

426
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,415
Let's give you the benefit of doubt

427
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:16,583
and say it was sugar, not methamphetamine.

428
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:18,544
Then you're saying

429
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:22,840
you left the scene right away
as soon as Seo came back to himself?

430
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:24,341
I want to be left alone.

431
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:26,718
Please leave.

432
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:36,812
However, both Kang Sol B and Seo Ji-ho
had never seen the sugar packet

433
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:39,189
although they came in after you.

434
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:42,443
<i>Seo Ji-ho said</i>
<i>the victim was intoxicated on drugs.</i>

435
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,486
<i>Kang Sol B said--</i>

436
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,073
We refused to have Kang Sol B's testimony,
so you cannot leak that out.

437
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:50,659
You can summon her and ask her yourself.

438
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:52,494
I didn't feel the need to do that,

439
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:55,747
but if you wanted to prove your innocence,

440
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,958
shouldn't you have her stand here

441
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,669
to confirm what she said
during the questioning?

442
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,756
Why didn't you summon her as a witness?

443
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,177
According to what you said,
you should beg to have her here.

444
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,847
She's here in court.

445
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:15,100
You should request
to have her as a witness.

446
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:17,060
A WITNESS CAN BE SUMMONED ON THE SPOT

447
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:20,147
I'm giving you this big chance.
Why won't you do it?

448
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:27,321
Kang Sol B's testimony will confirm
what he said isn't true.

449
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:30,782
It'll only confirm the fact that
the defendant is the real culprit.

450
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:38,415
Hey, what brings you here now?

451
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,792
I had a question for you. Let's go inside.

452
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:41,960
Hey, what's with you?

453
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,796
I have to hand these out.
I'm running late.

454
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,881
It's about Dan.

455
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,926
Did something happen between her
and Byeol's dad before she--

456
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,719
Stop!

457
00:26:50,802 --> 00:26:51,887
She's not our family.

458
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,181
Mom, tell me.

459
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:56,517
Did you know
she was in an assemblyman's camp?

460
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,851
I don't know anything.

461
00:26:57,935 --> 00:27:01,313
Why aren't you at school studying?
Don't say a thing on ancient history.

462
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:04,107
Don't come home
if you'll bring this up again.

463
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,109
I'm a busy woman, you know. Goodness.

464
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,839
FILES

465
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:28,757
PHOTOS FROM MY PHONE

466
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:32,427
On the day of the incident,

467
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:36,265
why weren't you there
at the mock trial class?

468
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:37,891
That morning,

469
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,645
I was emailed the video
of the Jurae-dong hit-and-run incident.

470
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:46,692
<i>I was on the scene at Jurae-dong</i>
<i>to check the facts.</i>

471
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:49,236
You returned to school at about 12:30 p.m.

472
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,155
Until that moment,

473
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:56,076
his anklet still had power,
so we could trace his whereabouts.

474
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,370
If you were in school,

475
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:01,206
why weren't you at the mock trial class?

476
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:03,417
Because of the shock.

477
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,628
And you even forgot
your duty as a professor?

478
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:11,049
Because you didn't know what you would do
if you saw the victim?

479
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:13,302
-He's leading the defendant!
-Sustained.

480
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:15,304
WITNESS

481
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:16,972
But in the end,

482
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:21,059
you went over to see the victim
after getting some coffee for him.

483
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:26,523
I wanted to make sure…

484
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,442
Thanks.

485
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:29,735
by asking him in person.

486
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:31,445
<i>The Jurae-dong hit-and-run case.</i>

487
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:36,783
It was you?

488
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,214
<i>Let's take a 30-minute break.</i>

489
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:17,366
Yes.

490
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,411
It was me.

491
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,748
Why did you put in that little?

492
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:25,916
Pour everything in.

493
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,795
You killed a child
but you don't want to die,

494
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:33,006
yet you're tormented
to shamelessly live on?

495
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:37,636
You're right.

496
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,724
I can't do this anymore.

497
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:45,644
<i>When you saw him,</i>

498
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:47,604
<i>did you become furious?</i>

499
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,818
Do you think
I got furious and killed him there?

500
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:55,070
If I wanted to,

501
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:57,656
I would've left him to die
from hypoglycemic shock.

502
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:01,159
I see. So there wouldn't have been
a need to give him sugar?

503
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:08,917
What if he didn't have hypoglycemia
to begin with?

504
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,294
-What is he suggesting?
-So what if he didn't?

505
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:13,005
-Then what will happen?
-What now?

506

NOTARIZED DOCUMENT

507
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:20,457
AGREEMENT

508
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,960
KANG CHIL-SEONG
WILL NOT ABUSE AN SUK-JA AGAIN

509
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:25,671
ONCE KANG DAN REACHES AN AGREEMENT
WITH KO HYEONG-SU

510
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,425
AGREEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING

511
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:31,427
KANG DAN, KANG CHIL-SEONG

512
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,845
ATTACHMENT

513

KANG DAN, KANG CHIL-SEONG

514
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:40,602
NOTARIZED DOCUMENT

515
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:42,271
AGREEMENT

516
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:46,108
This is a glucometer,
which the victim always used.

517
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:49,862
And he always kept a record
of his glucose level.

518
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,281
Let's look at the glucose level

519
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,908
tested at 12:30 p.m.
on the day of the incident.

520
00:30:56,994 --> 00:30:58,495
It's at 227.

521
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:00,330
This is hyperglycemic.

522
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:02,916
It wasn't previously on the list.

523
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,086
I had thought I wouldn't need this
to prove him guilty.

524
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,547
I'll turn it in as new evidence.

525
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,424
It's cheating to turn it in like this.

526
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,552
There's nothing to discuss.

527
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:17,056
If it's cheating,
the judge won't have to take it.

528
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:19,516
Well, you know…

529
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,186
Please do not accept it as evidence.

530
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:23,604
You must present that

531
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:26,315
the prosecutor's petty trick
cannot fool this court.

532
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:29,193
If you don't,
it'll be taken for the next one.

533
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:32,237
If your verdict gets overturned,
it'll have an impact on the judges.

534
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:33,322
Defendant.

535
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:35,783
So I understand that it's not easy.

536
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:37,493
-That's it.
-I see.

537
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,161
-That's tough.
-Very tricky.

538
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,871
Order!

539
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,792
I will accept it.

540
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,252
We'll put the questioning to a halt

541
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:48,670
and inspect the evidence.

542
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,799
Defense counsel, do you agree?

543
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,886
No, I do not.

544
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,806
Then I'd like to have the record

545
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:00,682
of the glucose level inspected.

546
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:02,643
Accepted.

547
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,395
Things were already unfavorable.

548
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,189
Why did he get on the judge's nerve?

549
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:12,820
His glucose level was 227
when it was taken at 12:30 p.m.

550
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:18,367
The possibility that 227
will turn into hypoglycemia at 14:55 is

551
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:23,163
nonexistent, unless the victim was
overdosed with insulin during that time.

552
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,082
WITNESS

553
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,584
-Isn't that so?
-Objection!

554
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:30,337
We do not know if this was
the victim's blood--

555
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,715
We already confirmed that it's his blood
through these bloody strips

556
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,551
from the trash can on the crime scene.

557
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:40,764
I have the NFS report that proves
the blood left here

558
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:41,932
belonged to the victim.

559
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:48,772
-How can this be?
-What?

560
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:50,023
It's game over.

561
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:52,151
-What's going to happen?
-It's now over.

562
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:53,694
He won't be able to get out.

563
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:56,655
YOU HAVE 2 MISSED CALLS

564
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:01,869
COURT

565
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:07,624
CALLS

566
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,042
JU-YEONG

567
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:10,586
<i>I was about to call you.</i>

568
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,088
-Ju-yeong.
<i>-Can you come to the hospital now?</i>

569
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:18,093
I can't do that now. I'm…

570
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:20,345
<i>You need to come see me first.</i>
<i>Come quickly.</i>

571
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:37,779
<i>I told you it's not late yet.</i>

572
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,700
<i>I believe you have the courage.</i>

573
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:42,659
HANKUK UNIV. HOSPITAL

574
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:43,577
<i>See you in court.</i>

575
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,494
PROF. KIM EUN-SUK

576
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:47,289
<i>It's not too late, Seung-jae.</i>
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

577
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:52,794
-You're here.
-Hey.

578
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:07,976
-This is…
-It's awesome!

579
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,021
-That's our baby.
-It was a success?

580
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:14,650
You looked really busy,

581
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,402
so I didn't mention it
until my blood level went up and up

582
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:19,363
and I began to see the fetus.

583
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:22,241
This time,
the sperm was in good condition,

584
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:24,368
and the fertilized egg
was implanted smoothly.

585
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:26,662
I did have a good feeling about it.

586
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,251
Why did you take this off?

587
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:38,382
Don't you ever take your ring off again.

588
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:42,052
It's now a sign that shows
you're this little one's dad.

589
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:49,101
I won't be hard on you
for going to law school now.

590
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,228
So, please study harder

591
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:53,647
for our baby's sake.

592
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,630
Get lost.

593
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,842
-Yeong-chang.
-"Yeong-chang"?

594
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,012
Go call Han Joon-hwi by his name.

595
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:28,056
I heard you weren't arrested
thanks to him.

596
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,311
I'm so sorry.

597
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:35,272
You're sorry?

598
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:39,234
You made me like this,
and you're sorry now?

599
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:49,077
Did he tell you to come see me?

600
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:53,457
Did he tell you to cry me a river
and beg me to settle?

601
00:36:11,224 --> 00:36:12,351
It must be really tough.

602
00:36:14,978 --> 00:36:16,146
I heard the news.

603
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,400
That he woke up, but one side of his body
is still paralyzed.

604
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:26,114
He could get better
if he continues to get treated.

605
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,075
Don't be hard on yourself.

606
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,370
I try not to.

607
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:36,375
But it feels like my fault.

608
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,378
How could this happen to you?

609
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:44,174
Don't I seem pathetic?

610
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,222
I thought it was

611
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:53,266
very admirable of you.

612
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:57,604
Bearing witness at the trial.

613
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,066
I couldn't have done that.

614
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:07,614
I thought I couldn't do it either.

615
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:12,119
When I saw Prof. Yang
sitting there as a defendant,

616
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:17,791
I realized how much weight
something I say could hold.

617
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,254
I didn't know when I read it on books,

618
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:24,506
but once I stood there,

619
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,094
I realized what this law we study

620
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:32,180
actually meant.

621
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:35,934
Then things happened.

622
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:47,279
Goodbye, then.

623
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,907
Please don't tell anyone
in our study group that you saw me.

624
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:52,993
-Ye-seul.
-I doubt

625
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:55,328
I'll return to school.

626
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:59,666
I don't want them to be worried about me.

627
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:04,045
Thanks for everything.

628
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:11,595
You would have

629
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:14,848
done the same.

630
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:37,412
Man, I don't think it'll be easy

631
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:39,122
unless we find the real culprit.

632
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:43,835
DEAN OH JEONG-HUI

633
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:49,049
If you're curious, come and see.

634
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:50,008
It seems chaotic.

635
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:52,761
Yes.

636
00:38:54,137 --> 00:38:55,764
What? It's over?

637
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,642
Prof. Yang requested to resume it later.

638
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:00,477
Aren't the odds against him now?

639
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,063
Forget the odds, it means he did it.

640
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:04,773
He wasn't hypoglycemic.

641
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:07,192
Professor Yang.

642
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,503
Why are you here?

643
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:28,505
The sugar packet.

644
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,801
-You think I saw it, right?
-Yes.

645
00:39:35,095 --> 00:39:36,972
But why didn't you ask me to testify?

646
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:41,518
That's your decision,
just as it was for Ye-seul.

647
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,236
<i>My wife got pregnant</i>
<i>after many failed attempts.</i>

648
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,322
<i>If she finds out what I did,</i>
<i>the worst can happen with the shock.</i>

649
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:56,783
<i>Please don't wait for me. I'm sorry.</i>

650
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,411
Why don't we persuade Sol B?

651
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:03,123
The prosecutor can't summon her
as a witness because she may say

652
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:04,583
she saw the sugar packet.

653
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,002
Please summon me as a witness.

654
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,381
I'll destroy
the prosecutor's argument at once.

655
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:16,636
Then you'll no longer be suspicious of me
for committing plagiarism.

656
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:21,057
You said you won't let your students
turn into an officer like me.

657
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,102
But she sounds just like me.

658
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:27,939
So you'll destroy my argument?

659
00:40:29,524 --> 00:40:32,152
Then you'll be all over the news
for making a deal

660
00:40:32,235 --> 00:40:34,904
with a murderer
to cover up your plagiarism.

661
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:49,544
Seo Ji-ho?

662
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:54,466
Okay. I'll stop by for a second.

663
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:07,812
So, you sued me?

664
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,067
You only learned rubbish from Yang.

665
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,030
A first-year law school student
should be studying really hard right now.

666
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:20,075
You shouldn't use your energy
on this nonsense.

667
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,202
Remember my call?

668
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:24,788
<i>Who's the prosecutor</i>
<i>mentioned in your article?</i>

669
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:27,415
I said I couldn't tell you
to protect my informant.

670
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:29,501
My father died because of him.

671
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:30,418
SEO GI-YEOL

672
00:41:30,502 --> 00:41:32,796
If you won't tell me,
I'll go to the prosecution.

673
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,047
There's no need.

674
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:40,804
<i>I'll tell you. Listen up.</i>

675
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:45,934
It's Prosecutor Seo Byung-ju.

676
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:48,687
Seo Byung-ju.

677
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,606
It was you, wasn't it?

678
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:54,067
That was ages ago.

679
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:57,112
You should've checked long ago.

680
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,824
Checking the facts is
the basic duty of a judicial officer.

681
00:42:05,537 --> 00:42:08,581
If you want to pass the bar exam at once,
drop the lawsuit

682
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:09,958
and focus on your studies.

683
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:24,973
He won't be an easy fight.

684
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:27,100
But I'll seem easy to him.

685
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:31,020
I guess so.

686
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:33,940
Why didn't I

687
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:37,485
ever think of checking this
with your uncle?

688
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:39,487
Checking the facts is the basics.

689
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:41,781
It is the basics.

690
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:46,411
Why didn't I ask him
for the reason he changed,

691
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,079
not even once?

692
00:42:56,671 --> 00:43:00,091
This was made by my dad's company.

693
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:04,596
Show him that you aren't that easy.

694
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:07,265
In my eyes, you also

695
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:09,517
don't seem too easy.

696
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:20,445
Sol!

697
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:26,743
-What brings you here?
-Hey, because I missed you.

698
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:31,206
I'm doing fine thanks to Joon-hwi.
Didn't he tell you?

699
00:43:39,255 --> 00:43:41,591
-Go home.
-Okay.

700
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:52,852
Dan cut us off ages ago,
and she's not in Korea anymore.

701
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:54,854
Even if you stayed here--

702
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:55,855
Telling me to move?

703
00:43:56,856 --> 00:43:59,025
I wanted to talk about Prof. Yang's trial.

704
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:01,569
If she ever calls, I'll let you know.

705
00:44:01,653 --> 00:44:03,655
Didn't she already call you? No?

706
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:05,281
If she called Prof. Yang,

707
00:44:05,365 --> 00:44:08,117
I'm sure she called her family.

708
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:09,744
He couldn't talk to her either.

709
00:44:09,828 --> 00:44:11,329
What the heck are you saying?

710
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:14,207
I saw him talk to her
with my own two eyes.

711
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,293
What are you talking…

712
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:21,923
You really didn't get a call?

713
00:44:22,757 --> 00:44:24,259
Man, what is this?

714
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:26,469
She feels closer to strangers
than her family?

715
00:44:27,262 --> 00:44:30,014
Maybe she got sick of all of you,
so she packed up and left.

716
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:32,183
Man.

717
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:34,185
You need to leave this area now.

718
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:40,650
Are you scared I might do something
to your cute little sister?

719
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,986
You're on a watch 24 hours a day

720
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:45,697
because there's a high chance
you'll commit another crime.

721
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,365
Exactly.

722
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:50,368
My every move is getting tracked.

723
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,079
What the heck can I do anyway?
Over there. Look.

724
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:08,761
Why did you install a CCTV
in front of my place?

725
00:45:08,845 --> 00:45:11,347
<i>To protect Byeol</i>
<i>and to get something I'm after.</i>

726
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:13,057
What are you after?

727
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:15,101
It's top secret right now.

728
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,187
Why did you leave during the trial?

729
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:20,607
My reason is top secret too.

730
00:45:21,983 --> 00:45:23,901
What about the trial? How did it go?

731
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,946
<i>He wasn't hypoglycemic to begin with?</i>

732
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:30,199
Isn't that critical for Prof. Yang?

733
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:32,535
Yes, for now.

734
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,911
Forget the sugar or whatnot.

735
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:36,497
We have to prove
the number on the tester is wrong.

736
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:38,833
If we say the date is wrong…

737
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:42,545
We should just catch the culprit.

738
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,257
Where are we going?

739
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:48,551
To run an errand for Prof. Kim.

740
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,626
Why do you look so worn out?

741
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,087
I'm fine.

742
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,840
Are you here alone?

743
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,219
My mom went out to get a lawyer,

744
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,181
but no one will take it.

745
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,432
Why not?

746
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,725
They all got scared.

747
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,187
The next president,
the man of the Judiciary Committee.

748
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,730
Assemblyman Ko is a big shot.

749
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,108
Darn it.
There are millions of lawyers in Korea.

750
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,319
We say there are too many.

751
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,904
The law circle is very tiny.

752
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,575
Everyone is a friend of another friend.
You can get a public defender.

753
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,243
What if he's like Park Geun-tae?

754
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,120
Not very likely.

755
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,665
You have to find an lawyer soon
to ask for a settlement.

756
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,960
He won't settle this case.

757
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,588
I'm not hopeful.

758
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
-But you have to--
-It's grievous bodily harm.

759
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,929
I won't be able to go to school anyway.

760
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,473
I don't care.

761
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,767
But we do.

762
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,852
Come to school.

763
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,355
Let's prepare together
until you find a lawyer.

764
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,656
It'd be perfect
if Prof. Kim could defend her.

765
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,784
A law school professor
can't be an attorney.

766
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,786
I know. I know that.

767
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,746
That's why she didn't defend Prof. Yang.

768
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,634
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

769
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,556
I'm sorry I suddenly visited
while you're distressed over your son.

770
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,686
Your sister was like this too.

771
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:40,440
She suddenly barged in like this
and asked for a job.

772
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,610
She seemed smart, so I trusted her.

773
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,738
I didn't think she'd betray me for money.

774
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,700
Right.

775
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,455
She wouldn't have become such a wreck
if it hadn't been for your stepfather.

776
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:01,795
The Kang Dan I know would rather get hurt
than become a wreck.

777
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,173
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

778
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,842
She wrote something like this.

779
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,973
NOTARIZED DOCUMENT

780
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,891
AGREEMENT

781
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,850
So what?

782
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,977
I was wondering
if you met my stepfather then.

783
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,395
KANG DAN, KANG CHIL-SEONG

784
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,900
Why would I?

785
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,944
It seemed like he needed the money,
not Dan.

786
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,279
Like I said,

787
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,114
your sister came to see me first.

788
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,783
I don't care if your stepfather
put her up for the money or--

789
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,160
I shouldn't have come.

790
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,370
Like father, like son.

791
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,831
Ko Yeong-chang took after you.

792
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,250
What?

793
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,462
The way he said Ye-seul framed him
after filming her in secret

794
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,381
is no different from that time
you said Dan framed you

795
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,133
when you actually did something illegal.

796
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,480
Are you sure you won't regret
what you just said?

797
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,318
Do you have any idea what you just did?

798
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,947
You just lost the chance for Jeon Ye-seul

799
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,616
to settle her case.

800
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,752
All right. We can't help it, then.

801
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,048
Can you let me know
if any lawyer would be up for this?

802
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,177
<i>If I can't take this case,</i>
<i>it means no one will.</i>

803
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,470
<i>Times are tough for us.</i>

804
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,264
<i>Why would we destroy our career</i>
<i>by defying Ko Hyeong-su?</i>

805
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,809
I should quit teaching
and defend her myself.

806
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,520
Okay, then. Goodbye.

807
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,189
Should I do it?

808
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,818
I'm sure
Ye-seul wouldn't want you to quit.

809
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,738
-I heard you and Joon-hwi saw her.
-Yes.

810
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,532
Did you ask her to return to school?

811
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,701
I did, but she didn't give me
a good answer.

812
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,411
I did it too.

813
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:01,331
I sent her millions of text saying
I'll wait until she comes. She will.

814
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,669
Hey, Attorney Lim.
I'm calling on behalf of my student--

815
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,672
Yes. You already know?

816
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,133
You can't do it?

817
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,718
My goodness.

818
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,097
Look at that kid.

819
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,392
He almost died
then barely came back to life.

820
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,019
But just grievous bodily harm?

821
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,188
Tell the prosecutor

822
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,399
to switch the arraignment
to attempted murder!

823
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,569
We have to be careful
if we want to charge her with that.

824
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,447
We have to prove her motive,
that it was intentional.

825
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:38,160
It won't be easy to prove
if Jeon Ye-seul intended to kill him.

826
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,746
You're taking loads of money,

827
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,331
yet you only want to do easy work?

828
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,878
They had been dating,

829
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,381
and the incident broke out
as she tried to stop him

830
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,716
from sending a video.

831
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,469
No, that's not it.

832
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,058
You better get your facts straight.

833
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,394
He wasn't trying to send it.

834
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,272
He was trying to delete it

835
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,442
as he asked that brat
to break up with him.

836
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,570
Even so,

837
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,033
the court is very strict
when it comes to attempted murder cases.

838
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:23,038
The prosecutor said we should charge her
for bodily harm and punish her--

839
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,122
Attorney Song.

840
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,000
Here's my take.

841
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,838
I don't want that brat to be branded

842
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:36,009
as just some petty assailant
after doing that to my kid.

843
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,556
I'll make sure
she has no place in this world

844
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,185
by making her guilty of murder
or attempted murder.

845
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,606
If that's what you want--

846
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,526
If you can't do that,
get her punished more severely!

847
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,487
Yes, sir.

848
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,073
Who's her attorney?

849
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,867
No one will dare to jump on this case.

850
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,703
Let me know if anyone good takes her case.

851
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,331
I'll make them useless.

852
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,379
GRADES

853
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,922
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, MOON HONG-GI

854
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,133
I just proved what I can do.

855
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,302
I surpassed everyone
and took the top as an outsider,

856
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,887
so they hate me a little.

857
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,683
Great job.

858
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:36,403
Prof. Yang filed a complaint
with the school regarding your plagiarism.

859
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,406
We'll begin by discerning the truth.

860
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,326
I will be taking part as the vice dean,
not your father--

861
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,289
It's a loss for the school to lose
a talented student like me.

862
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,041
Please make a wise decision

863
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,794
as the vice dean, not as my dad.

864
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,846
About Seung-jae's grades.

865
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,181
I wasn't trying to see it--

866
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,098
You wanted to.

867
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,018
Fine. I tried my best to take a peek.

868
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,895
How could it all plummet from A plus?

869
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,398
And he submitted an empty sheet
for Civil Code. Something is going on.

870
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,484
He isn't even in school.
He was always in school.

871
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,862
You should call him.

872
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,031
Okay. Eat your food.

873
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,577
I don't think Sol A has to worry
about flunking the year now.

874
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,620
Her finals went well.

875
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,914
Went well, my foot.

876
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,790
My finals for Criminal Code were awful,

877
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,085
and I have no idea what I wrote down
for Constitutional Law.

878
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,964
But it's a relief that I picked out
a potential question for the Civil Code.

879
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,966
You did the best on Criminal Code midterm.

880
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,218
Yes.

881
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,346
Thanks to that abnormality,
I think I may not flunk out.

882
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,640
But I'll have to see.

883
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,768
But still, you had one best score.
Congrats.

884
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,854
-Not flunking isn't cause for celebration.
-Hey!

885
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:57,275
If you're worried about failing after
studying hard, then consider giving up.

886
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,069
She says she won't have to worry.

887
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,238
Hey, guys.

888
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,448
Did you look at Prof. Jung's announcement?

889
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:07,160
He'll only grade us on finals and reports,
leaving out Prof. Yang's midterm.

890
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,788
-Are you serious?
-Parents and students protested

891
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,998
how the school let him
give out the midterm.

892
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,708
The trial doesn't look promising,

893
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,835
so the school accepted
Prof. Jung's request.

894
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,008
I heard Prof. Jung went off the grid
to avoid objections from students.

895
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,010
If he leaves out the midterm,

896
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,638
Sol A would be the biggest victim in this.

897
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,060
So is Prof. Yang guilty?

898
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,979
They asked him to remove his office.

899
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,689
In other words, get lost.

900
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,732
If he's a killer, he should be long gone.

901
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,650
What?

902
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,861
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

903
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,989
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

904
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,282
Is this true?

905
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,786
Did you force your student who caused
grievous injury on Assemblyman Ko's son

906
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,997
to get examined for sexual assault?

907
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,623
No, I just made a suggestion.

908
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,208
What are you trying to do?

909
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,127
Are you trying to humiliate my son

910
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,878
because I won't take your bait?

911
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,839
Wasn't killing my best friend enough?

912
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,008
After what happened with your midterm,

913
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,927
if you continue
to cause trouble like this,

914
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
we cannot condone this any further.

915
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,099
He has already been put off duty.

916
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,560
There's a high chance
he'll be found guilty.

917
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,854
You shouldn't mention it
before his verdict is--

918
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,107
Does he hold your weakness or something?

919
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,609
Why are you
taking his side so desperately?

920
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,194
You're crossing over the line.

921
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,530
What do you want to say to me?

922
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,578
Apologize to the assemblyman politely,

923
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,581
and it'll look better
if you quit first, so--

924
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,915
I am not going to quit.

925
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,544
You can fire me
once the Supreme Court finds me guilty.

926
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,185
If you want

927
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,229
that brat to settle this,

928
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:02,275
you'll have to kneel down before me first.

929
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:09,908
Your student became obsessed with my son,

930
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,577
then caused this tragedy.

931
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,206
The victim in this incident
is the one who got hurt like a moron,

932
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,458
my son.

933
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,257
This is why we say
one can never get rid of their habits.

934
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,218
You little jerk.

935
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,011
Wipe your hands.

936
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,680
And remember, I'm keeping my eyes on you,

937
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,892
the man who loves to mess around
with fake news.

938
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,577
YANG JONG-HOON: ON BUSINESS

939
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,089
My goodness!

940
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,637
Are you all right?

941
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,433
You don't look all right to me.

942
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,602
I will be.

943
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,524
Lee Man-ho said you talked to Dan.

944
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,525
I did.

945
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,694
She called while I was with him,

946
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,821
so I asked her to text me her number.

947
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,406
But nothing yet.

948
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,075
Wait.

949
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,919
I went to see Assemblyman Ko over this.

950
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,714
But I think I caused trouble.

951
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,091
I went over to talk about Dan,

952
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,801
but I brought up Ye-seul, too.

953
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,390
What if she can't settle her case
because of me?

954
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,396
I made him furious.

955
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,735
Great work.

956
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,529
-Sorry?
-Great job.

957
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,493
-What about settling…
-Find another way, then.

958
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,838
A WAY TO AVOID SETTLING A CASE

959
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,468
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SETTLE YOUR CASE
FOR NORMAL ACUPUNCTURE

960
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,844
Gosh, darn it.

961
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,180
Is there a way out of this
without a settlement?

962
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,563
SECOND SEMESTER GRADES

963
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,565
Please.

964
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,276
Darn it.

965
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,821
Prof. Jung Dae-hyeon must be my enemy.

966
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,907
I don't think Ye-seul is here.

967
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,703
Time for the grades of truth.

968
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,997
My gosh, my heart is racing too.

969
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,250
Please.

970
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,127
Please. My gosh, please.

971
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,257
CHECK

972
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,176
Please.

973
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,721
Darn it! I can't do it.

974
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,474
I can't bring myself to check this.

975
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,352
What? You were all in my office.

976
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,104
Ye-seul.

977
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,230
Ye-seul.

978
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,482
We have a long way to travel.
Let's get going.

979
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,942
-Let's go.
-Okay.

980
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,073
You were interested in crime publication
since middle school,

981
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,867
and you won an award on this too.

982
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,160
So you want to test me?

983
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,248
If you help me,
I'll believe you wrote the paper.

984
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,667
How are you going to show me your trust?

985
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,588
-What?
-Since we went to middle school together,

986
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,174
be a witness and say I wrote it.

987
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,594
What do you--

988
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,223
Hello?

989
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,642
Yes, I'll be there right now.

990
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,354
Are we all here?

991
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,732
-I'm here for Seung-jae.
-Okay.

992
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,901
I feel very reassured now.

993
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,904
Sadly, at this moment,

994
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,656
even if she finds a private
or a public defender,

995
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,451
they won't be able to put in
everything they can do.

996
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,536
I'll put in everything I can do!

997
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,664
And me too?

998
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,041
And him too.

999
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,668
Settle first to reduce sentencing.

1000
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,795
Is that possible?

1001
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,589
She should kneel down if she must.

1002
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,090
To a jerk like him? No way.

1003
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,175
Should I go do it?

1004
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:41,262
I thought of a few ways
so that she can avoid settling the case.

1005
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,474
I thought of this all night.

1006
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,186
About Ye-seul, I mean.
We can argue that it was self-defense.

1007
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,230
Spreading a sexual video
is already illegal,

1008
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,151
and Ye-seul felt tormented to death
because of his actions,

1009
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,946
so she was trying to stop him
before he uploaded it.

1010
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,490
CASE RULING

1011
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,492
Why don't we go with self-defense?

1012
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,202
Self-defense?

1013
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,161
I agree.

1014
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,413
Self-defense isn't recognized too often.

1015
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,292
The court has strict criteria
on acknowledging self-defense,

1016
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,795
-so it won't be easy.
-It's not a fight if it's easy.

1017
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,464
It's a recent ruling of a first trial.

1018
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,841
Judge interpreted defense broadly
and affirmed self-defense.

1019
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,511
First rulings can be reversed
on the second trial

1020
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,805
-and in the Supreme Court.
-It may not happen.

1021
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,599
The ruling pointed out that
it's degenerative to assert

1022
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,685
you should just stand a beating
in a fight.

1023
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,937
If this was made
at least in the lower court,

1024
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,313
it means we have a chance.

1025
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:33,898
Okay.

1026
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,401
Let's make Ye-seul innocent.

1027
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,071
Then we'll need a good attorney too.

1028
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,864
Who's his attorney?

1029
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:48,871
JEON YE-SEUL'S FIRST TRIAL

1030
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,127
What? They're all his attorneys?

1031
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,379
Why does he have so many?
He must be insane.

1032
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,816
Why isn't Ye-seul's attorney here?

1033
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,235
Her public defender resigned again.

1034
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,653
Then who'll be here?

1035
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,488
I'm sure someone else was assigned.

1036
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,656
All rise.

1037
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,841
GRADES

1038
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,347
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

1039
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,688
PROSECUTION

1040
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,527
Defendant.

1041
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,030
When will your attorney get here?

1042
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,536
They already seem half-hearted.

1043
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,914
She's already in a tight spot.

1044
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,750
-I'll go outside and check.
-Okay.

1045
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:30,973
I apologize.

1046
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,731
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

1047
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,404
-No way.
-What's going on?

1048
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,323
Prof. Yang is defending her?

1049
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,033
Is that allowed?

1050
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,788
Your Honor.

1051
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:58,126
In order for the defendant to be
fairly judged by the Court and the people,

1052
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:02,046
I would like to request a jury trial.

1053
01:04:13,928 --> 01:04:19,920
Subtitle translation by Eun Sook Youn

1054
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:29,949
Ergo,

1055
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,327
I request that Yang Jong-hoon be sentenced
to 20 years in prison.

1056
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,913
<i>So you're deliberately barking up</i>
<i>the wrong tree.</i>

1057
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,499
<i>Make sure you catch the real killer.</i>

1058
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,793
I said I did it alone because of a grudge!

1059
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,044
<i>Something's fishy.</i>

1060
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:46,465
<i>I need to ask something.</i>

1061
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,385
<i>One of my uncle's belongings is missing.</i>

1062
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,053
-Why?
-Not why but how.

1063
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,680
<i>That's what you want to know.</i>

1064
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,891
You did this to me.
And what? Self-defense?

1065
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,394
<i>The court will be criticized</i>
<i>for appointing a murderer. Not a chance.</i>

1066
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,478
<i>So it's up to you.</i>

1067
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,480
<i>I'll take care of it, sir.</i>

1068
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,441
Professor! What do I do?
