Kang Sol.

00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:25,701
You're not curious.

6
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,120
You're not curious at all.

7
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:29,621
<i>Was her name Kang Sol?</i>

8
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:31,957
-<i>Kang Dan's twin sister.</i>
-Subrogation rights.

00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,336
A KNOU graduate who served time in juvie.

10
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:38,047
How did she manage to get into Hankuk Law?

11
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,716
She's really getting on my nerves.

12
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:47,056
She got in through the special screening
for low-income applicants.

13
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,893
Don't worry, sir.
It's not like she can do anything.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,982
Oh, right. Yang Jong-hoon
was the prosecutor who sent her to juvie.

15
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,694
He was told to send her to jail,
but he ignored it.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,991
Yang Jong-hoon, that moron.

17
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,243
How dare he try to bait me?

18
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:10,871
He's baiting you?

19
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:13,499
You must lock him up.

20
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,960
You'll lose that moron
if you let your guard down.

21
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,088
I won't let that happen.

22
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:23,842
I have a secret weapon ready,
so he won't be able to get out of it.

23
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,302
That's what I like to hear.

24
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:29,014
Defendant.

25
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:34,853
You stated you were in your office
at the presumed time of his death,

26
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:38,357
between 14:25 and 14:55, correct?

27
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:40,943
Yes. You're right.

28
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:46,698
JUDGE

29
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:54,706
I was in my office.

30
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,044
You should've come early.

31
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,004
It got very interesting.

32
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,591
Any other questions for the witness?

33
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,885
I do have one more question.

34
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,472
Did you mention the possibility of this
being a suicide?

35
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:14,101
Yes, I asked if that possibility
was completely ruled out.

36
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:15,561
Why?

37
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:19,189
When I saw Professor Seo, he was already
under the influence of the drug.

38
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,985
My head…
I feel like it's splitting in half.

YU SEUNG-JAE

43
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,802
Had it been a murder,
he would've mentioned the killer's name.

44
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:49,761
That's right.

45
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:51,388
And with that handwritten note…

46
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,098
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

47
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:54,183
Your Honor.

48
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,519
When the detective who found the note
suspected suicide,

49
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:00,063
the defendant firmly told him
it was not the case.

50
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,982
-Am I wrong?
-That was--

51
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,485
You're right.
I did say it wasn't a suicide case.

52
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,195
And I still stand behind that.

53
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:11,116
He mistook the witness
for Han Joon-hwi, his nephew,

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,911
which means he was in no condition
to explain his situation.

55
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,415
That is a good point.

56
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,708
Darn it.

57
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,876
No further questions.

58
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,923
Defendant, do you realize
that statement could be used against you?

59
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,257
Yes.

60
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,220
I can't turn a murder into a suicide
just to get out of this.

61
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,139
Okay.

62
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,850
Witness, thank you.

63
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:39,895
JUDGE

64
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,898
But you see, if I killed him…

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,152
I'd be happy if the detectives thought
it was a suicide.

66
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,155
Why would I want to say
that it wasn't a suicide?

67
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,032
-What?
-Good point.

68
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,242
-That's true.
-My gosh.

69
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,577
Is he really the killer?

70
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:56,745
I'm not sure.

71
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,540
People are beginning to doubt it,
and reasonably so.

72
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:13,262
"An obligee may exercise the rights
belonging to the obligor."

73
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,471
The Civil Code, Article…

74
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,976
Article… 404. Article 404.

75
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,271
In order to exercise the rights--

76
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,398
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

77
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:27,359
-What brings you here?
-My case is going to trial.

78
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:31,363
Suspension of indictment is like pleading
guilty. So I'll prove my innocence.

79
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,865
If it's because of what I said…

80
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,075
No, you were right.

81
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,286
No, it wasn't my place to say that.

82
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:40,372
Professor Kim Eun-suk agrees.

83
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,374
What was his name? Mr. Han Joon-hwi?

84
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:45,210
He helped me a lot.

85
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:46,128
I see.

86
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,131
Everyone knew but me?

87
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:54,344
I wanted to tell you but was worried
it'd distract you from studying.

88
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:58,265
Because of me,
you were even told to repeat the year.

89
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,894
No. I won't fail and retake it
just because I was told to.

90
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,693
Ace the exam, for my sake.

91
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,737
Yes, I should.

92
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,280
I can do it.

93
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,994
I should do my very best.

94
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,414
Where was I?

95
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:30,047
I'm the one who wrote the opinion,
and I even had a nosebleed because of it.

96
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,132
I can't believe Joon-hwi didn't tell me.

97
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,975
I should just blame my bad grades.
It's all my fault.

98
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:57,157
You can't sleep if you drink coffee now.

99
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,411
You must be exhausted. You should rest up.

100
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:04,498
It's evidence.

101
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:11,963
Witness.

102
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,343
Are you aware
that the defendant told the police

103
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,553
you're probably the one
who killed the victim?

104
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:21,932
Yes.

105
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,185
I'm an evil criminal, you know.

106
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:28,397
He probably thought it'd be perfect
to just dump it all on me.

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,067
Why did you go to Hankuk Law School
on the day of the incident?

108
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:36,988
<i>I was Mr. Seo Byung-ju's personal driver</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

109
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:42,077
<i>I always drove him to the school</i>
<i>when he had a lecture.</i>

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,580
That day,
I left as soon as I parked the car.

111
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,458
So you weren't on campus
at the time of the incident?

112
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,169
-No, I definitely was not.
-How can we trust you?

113
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,922
How do we trust the words
of an evil criminal?

114
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,132
WITNESS

115
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:05,100
-What's he doing?
-You can trust this ankle monitor.

116
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:09,855
I see. Because of this,
we can track your every move.

117

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

118
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:18,363
We have checked and verified
that you were near Mr. Seo's law office

119
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,991
between 14:20 and 14:55,
the estimated time of death.

120
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,077
Thank goodness I had this on.

121
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,662
Your Honor.

122
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:30,041
That day, the defendant
was also wearing an ankle monitor

123
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,544
to experience what it's like.

124
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,463
JUDGE

125
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,548
Why couldn't we retrace his steps?

126
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,592
He claims that,

127
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,303
by pure coincidence…

128
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,763
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

129
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:44,014
…it was out of battery.

130
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:47,225
Dead battery means it's not trackable.

131
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:50,395
-Does the monitoring center let it happen?
-No, never.

132
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,023
The Ministry of Justice isn't a joke.

133
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,777
That's because he's not a criminal.
He did it just to experience it.

134
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,320
Is that so?

135
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:01,364
I'm actually wearing one now.

136
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,784
So I know they strictly abide
by the protocols.

137
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,535
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

138
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,164
At the moment,
the battery is at around 25 percent.

139
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,375
And the monitoring center…

140
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,418
MONITORING CENTER

141
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,503
…is calling.

142
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,130
LEE MAN-HO'S ROUTES

143
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,091
If you don't answer…

144
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,051
JUDGE

145
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:21,968
MONITORING CENTER

146
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,429
MONITORING CENTER

147
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,473
…they keep calling until you pick up.

148
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:27,808
May I answer this call?

149
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:30,519
They'll send a probation officer
if I don't pick up.

150
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:31,436
JUDGE

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,771
Sure, go ahead.

152
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,565
Hello?

153
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,567
Yes, I'll charge it right away.

154
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:39,569
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

155
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,904
Why did he ignore this call

156
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,533
and decide not to charge it right away?

157
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:48,578
It was because

158
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:52,207
you didn't want your location
to be tracked.

159
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,751
Because it'd prove
that you were at the scene

160
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,838
at the time of the incident,
not in your office.

161
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:05,011
<i>It didn't look like</i>
<i>Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.</i>

162
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,055
<i>So what if he feels guilty at this point?</i>

163
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:09,599
<i>But still, he leaked it out,</i>
<i>not Seo Byung-ju.</i>

164
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,059
<i>I told you to be quiet!</i>

165
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,940
<i>It didn't look like</i>
<i>Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.</i>

166
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:23,363
How did you find out?

167
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,657
<i>Kim Hyeon-jae and Choi Jung-hyeok</i>

168
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,286
<i>were the first reporters to cover the case</i>
<i>and Prof. Yang's charges, in depth.</i>

169
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,203
CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

170
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:33,415
<i>They wrote the articles based on the info</i>
<i>leaked by Prosecutor Jin.</i>

171
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,961
<i>And they covered your father's case</i>
<i>before any other reporters did.</i>

172
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,798
-It could be a coincidence--
-Naturally, it seems fishy.

173
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,049
I need to look into this.

174
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:47,012
Statute of limitations, five years.
It'll expire soon.

175
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:51,850
You must be very careful if you want
to get Prosecutor Jin indicted.

176
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:55,145
This was recorded in secret,
which means it was unlawfully obtained.

177
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,772
What have I been doing all this time?

178
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:01,151
You were barking up the wrong tree.

179
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:03,403
But it helped me discover this.

180
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,952
Counsel,
you may cross-examine the witness.

181
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,245
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

182
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:18,835
No questions, Your Honor.

183
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,047
Witness, you may return to your seat.

184
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,717
If there are no further questions,

185
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,053
we will wrap up here.

186
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,512
Your Honor.

187
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,806
I'd like to bring in another witness.

188
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:34,934
-Who is it?
-I found an eyewitness

189
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,896
who saw the defendant kill Seo Byung-ju.

190
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,814
-What?
-Seriously?

191
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:44,361
I'd like to keep the witness' identity
confidential until the next trial.

192
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,779
This is unacceptable.

193
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:49,491
Who is this witness?
You can't spring it on us like this.

194
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:51,534
The witness is terrified
that the defendant

195
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:55,789
would retaliate if any info
were to be revealed in advance.

196
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,457
The witness

197
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,960
couldn't come forward sooner
for fear of ending up like the victim--

198
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:04,422
If the info is kept confidential,
what about Mr. Yang's right of defense?

199
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:09,260
Well, the right should be guaranteed.
So, on the condition that

200
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:13,890
the defendant won't try to contact
the witness under any circumstances,

201
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,601
-please disclose--
-Then I'll probably contact the witness,

202
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,269
so let him have his way.

203
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:19,688
-What?
-Professor Yang!

204
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,189
-What?
-Why did he say that?

205
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,239
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

206
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,156
There he is.

207
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,117
Who is this new witness?

208
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,702
Why come forward now?

209
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,704
Will this witness be the smoking gun?

210
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:38,581
I must protect the witness,
so I can't say anything now.

211
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,958
See you at the next trial.

212
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,626
-Mr. Jin!
-Just a comment!

213
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,628
-Tell us.
-Just a comment, please

214
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,505
Say a few words as a prosecutor.

215
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:46,798
-Prosecutor.
-Tell us.

216
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,174
Please, just a comment.

217
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:49,259
Say a few words.

218
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,176
Wait, Mr. Jin.

219
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,344
Gosh.

220
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:56,141
He said this new witness
saw you murder the victim.

221
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,851
This will be the smoking gun.

222
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,228
Once he brings in this witness,
it's game over.

223
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,522
How could you say that to the judge?

224
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,858
How can we not know about the witness?

225
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,776
It is ridiculous, isn't it?

226
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,654
I agree that your client
is a total nutcase.

227
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:12,699
I have to say, this must be tough for you.

228
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:15,201
How are we going to prepare
for the cross-examination?

229
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,455
He means you don't need to prepare for it.

230
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,375
What do you mean?

231
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,335
He said this person witnessed the murder.

232
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,672
That'd only matter
if Prof. Yang murdered the victim.

233
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,967
He's bringing in a false witness?

234
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,761
Right, he must be pissed off.

235
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,971
Prof. Yang publicly humiliated him
that he'd be

236
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,141
the first prosecutor to be indicted
for publicizing an alleged crime.

237
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,644
Why did you have to provoke
the prosecutor?

238
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,272
Who did he bribe?

239
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:46,024
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

240
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:53,573
There you are.

241
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:56,868
Spare us a moment.

242
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:00,455
-Why should I?
-He wants to talk to you.

243
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,707
They seem busy, so keep it brief.

244
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,884
I'm sure you know who my father is.

245
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,056
I'm going to sue Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u
for publicizing an alleged crime.

246
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,771
Thanks to you, I discovered
that I had been barking up the wrong tree.

247
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,231
<i>Is this real?</i>

248
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:27,816
<i>The son of TOYGOODTOY's CEO is</i>

249
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,234
<i>-Yang's student?</i>
-What's this?

250
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:30,944
-You recorded this?
-<i>I got chills.</i>

251
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:33,988
<i>He thinks Seo Byung-ju disclosed</i>
<i>his dad's accusation.</i>

252
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:37,116
<i>So, that's why his nephew came to see me.</i>

253
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,245
<i>I hope he didn't do this</i>
<i>to get his father's revenge.</i>

254
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:42,747
<i>Be quiet. Man, I can't believe this mess.</i>

255
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:47,293
<i>It didn't look like</i>
<i>Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.</i>

256
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:49,587
<i>So what if he feels guilty at this point?</i>

257
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:52,048
<i>But, still, he leaked it out,</i>
<i>not Seo Byung-ju.</i>

258
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,883
<i>I told you to be quiet!</i>

259
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,052
You recorded this secretly?

260
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:00,473
I wanted him to know that my uncle
wasn't the one who leaked the info.

261
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:02,642
Who knew it was Prosecutor Jin?

262
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:05,562
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

263
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:08,773
-The cat's out of the bag.
-Once he's indicted,

264
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,777
I'd like you to be my witnesses.

265
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,445
What?

266
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:20,618
Even if Jin actually leaked all the info,
he won't be indicted.

267
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:23,329
Even your professor couldn't do it.

268
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:26,749
We can do better. We, as his students,
ought to make it happen.

269
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,750
I'll make it happen.

270
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,086
With this recording?

271
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,340
Are you guys really law students?

272
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,635
Secret recordings of others are considered
unlawful evidence.

273
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,179
They're inadmissible in court.

274
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:40,972
I know.

275
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:43,141
I should've partaken in this conversation.

276
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:46,269
Then you wouldn't have had
to come out in the open with this.

277
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,315
I recorded my conversation
with the two of you this time,

278
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,194
so it's no longer considered unlawful.

279
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,505
PROSECUTION

280
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,136
This courtroom of all places.

281
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,554
JUDGE

282
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:22,847
JUDGE

283
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,767
Prosecution.

284
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,684
JUDGE

285
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,269
Arraign the accused.

286
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:31,147
He's innocent.

287
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,482
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

288
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:37,737
Did you just say
the defendant is innocent?

289
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:42,408
Then why did you indict him
in the first place?

290
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:46,287
Had I refused to do it, they would have
replaced me with another prosecutor.

291
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:47,330
DEFENSE COUNSEL

292
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,667
The defendant did not embezzle
the company fund.

293
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,878
Some higher-ups in the prosecution
has the CEO's back.

294
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:56,130
He followed the CEO's orders
and took the fall.

295
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:59,676
Therefore, the defendant is not guilty.

296
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,010
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

297
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:10,395
You became famous after that trial.

298
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,356
PROSECUTION

299
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,941
I didn't want you to quit.

300
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,071
I hoped you'd never leave
the Prosecutors' Office.

301
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:22,323
You left before I did.

302
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:23,533
That's true.

303
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,871
Gosh, I thought I had no regrets.

304
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,541
But it feels weird to be sitting here now.

305
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,627
What will you do now?

306
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,881
You couldn't prove your alibi,

307
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,842
and there's a new witness now.

308
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,219
I'll look for a witness.

309
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,975
A real witness
who can help me prove my alibi.

310
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,937
You didn't have to come.

311
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,023
What would the doctor think?

312
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,691
I spoke with the school.

313
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,570
You'll take Prof. Moon's
Constitutional Law course.

314
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,155
What?

315
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,365
-The semester is almost over.
-Okay.

316
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:06,743
What are you talking about?

317
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,619
Why would you switch courses now?

318
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:11,289
It's better than not being able
to use my laptop in class.

319
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,208
Don't even bring it up.
Aren't you sick of it?

320
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:18,921
<i>Seung-jae, you went to the trial too?</i>

321
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,173
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

322
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:24,719
If you switch to that class,
everyone will find out

323
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,637
-that you're my daughter.
-I have to go.

324
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,516
Prof. Moon's exam questions
are from his books that are out of print.

325
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,602
Then get me those books
as soon as you can.

326
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,979
Okay, I'll search the entire country
if I have to.

327
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,197
KANG SOL B

328
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:48,451
Give me some time.

329
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:52,914
I'm not sure whether I should tell you,

330
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:54,832
-or--
-I'll give you some time.

331
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,834
But don't tell anyone else

332
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,795
before you answer my question.

333
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,133
That ring…

334
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,095
Are you going to keep wearing it?

335
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,816
Here's your coffee.

336
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:26,531
This and Kang Sol B's laptop were switched
in the cart because

337
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:27,782
they're the same model?

338
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,284
Then who put your laptop in there?

339
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,328
The person who took my laptop, obviously.

340
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:36,207
The TA said Kang Sol B's
was returned to her.

341
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,167
It's this guy here.

342
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:41,504
-But I have no idea who it is.
-Yeah, it's hard to tell.

343
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,841
With the cap and the mask,
all I can see is that it's a guy.

344
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,720
Oh, hold on.

345
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,479
I think I know who this is.

346
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,985
What did you just say?

347
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:08,448
What do you mean I'm the witness
the prosecutor mentioned?

348
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,117
You're the witness.

349
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,666
You couldn't tell the police
when they interviewed you.

350
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:24,130
That day, you saw that prick
slip something into Seo's coffee.

351
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,549
It was meth, not sugar.

352
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,092
What's with you?

353
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:31,596
I'm telling you that you saw it.

354
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,099
You're insane.

355
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:36,601
You're insane!

356
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,816
You're insane.
You've completely lost your mind!

357
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,819
And the spy camera too.
Why are you doing this to me?

358
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,488
What do you mean?

359
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,031
You're hurting my feelings here.

360
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:51,073
Yeong-chang.

361
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,575
We'll get married soon.

362
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,411
I set up the camera in your room
to keep you safe

363
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,121
because I love you.

364
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,962
You think that's love?

365
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,756
Of course.

366
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,638
Let's get married next year.

367
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,806
As soon as I get into law school.

368
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,272
But to do that, we must make Yang
pay for what he did.

369
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,276
-Didn't you see him mess with my dad?
-Don't let a personal grudge--

370
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,737
That bastard killed Seo
because of a personal grudge.

371
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,950
But he hasn't been convicted yet.

372
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:37,995
Presumption of innocence?

373
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:40,665
You're a law student after all.

374
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,710
Out of the people that left shoeprints
at the scene,

375
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:46,712
who else could be the culprit, then?

376
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:50,925
Ye-seul.

377
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,054
Why don't you get it?

378
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:59,433
It's not like I'm trying to frame
an innocent man.

379
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:04,855
That sly murderer is trying to get away
with a murder using his legal knowledge.

380
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:07,692
Let's teach him a lesson.

381
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,404
What?

382
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,197
What are you saying?

383
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,658
-A recording?
-You took it off already?

384
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:20,538
I'll call you back.

385
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,375
You know why I quit being a prosecutor.

386
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,711
Want to know why I became a law professor?

387
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:31,632
To make sure there are
no more scumbag prosecutors like you.

388
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,343
Remember that.

389
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,055
To win back your position
and teach again--

390
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,559
I must clear my name,
so I'll have no more of your antics.

391
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:43,853
Do you think you'll get your way?

392
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:46,772
We shall see.

393
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,238
Hey, Ye-seul.

394
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,784
Hey! What's wrong? Are you all right?

395
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,381
MY HUBBY

396
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:21,307
That was a great cross-examination.

397
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,020
You were awesome.

398
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,898
Really?

399
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,776
I'm pretty awesome.

400
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,029
You believe

401
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,784
that Professor Yang
didn't kill him, right?

402
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,370
No.

403
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:44,663
I don't believe anyone.

404
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,669
I've been burned by someone
who had my absolute trust,

405
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:52,797
and it broke me, you know.

406
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:57,385
It still hurts.

407
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,847
Then on the witness stand, why did you--

408
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,475
I just told the truth, that's all.

409
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:09,105
I can't commit perjury
when I want to work in law.

410
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:14,402
Does it mean there's a possibility
that he actually killed him?

411
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:16,404
It can't be completely ruled out,

412
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:18,948
if the new witness is telling the truth.

413
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,581
You keep this.

414
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:38,884
KO YEONG-CHANG

415
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,636
I WILL NEVER HIT JEON YE-SEUL AGAIN

416
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,853
MY HUBBY

417
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:54,859
MY HUBBY

418
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,454
MY HUBBY
1 VIDEO FILE

419
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,334
<i>Don't forget</i>

420
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,879
<i>this long night we had.</i>

421
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,526
You knew it was Prosecutor Jin?

422
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:42,573
Unfortunately, what you sent to Ji-ho
is unlawfully obtained evidence.

423
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,164
Which is why Ji-ho recorded this himself.

424
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,086
You want Ji-ho
to sue Prosecutor Jin, don't you?

425
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:02,259
You were right.
One of my uncle's belongings is missing.

426
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,637
His glucometer.

427
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:07,681
They returned everything else but that.

428
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:10,392
It must be his next card
after the fake witness.

429
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:45,553
The president would like you
to apologize to Assemblyman Ko.

430
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:46,554
Me?

431
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:48,806
You humiliated him
in front of the students.

432
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:50,182
I just wanted to check.

433
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,685
It wasn't the right place for it.

434
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,728
The students were forced to be there.

435
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,820
-So you won't apologize?
-I suppose he won't sue me?

436
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:04,363
Sue you?

437
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:07,992
I'm hoping Assemblyman Ko
will sue me for defamation.

438
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:13,289
I take it that you want to call

439
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,499
the election law violation
into question again.

440
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,792
Yes.

441
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,300
I told the president
that we'd be violating

442
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:28,429
freedom of conscience
if we forced you to apologize.

443
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:32,725
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,352
For putting you through all this.

445
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:36,854
If you want to apologize to me,

446
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,815
just make sure you get acquitted.

447
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:42,901
The president

448
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:47,489
will fire you
the moment you get a guilty verdict.

449
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:49,908
You know that, right?

450
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,335
Seriously?

451
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,171
You won't attend his trials?
You, for real?

452
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,214
NOT EVEN CURIOUS

453
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:05,883
I'm sure you're curious.

454
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,469
It was like Pandora's box.

455
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,220
NOT EVEN CURIOUS

456
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:14,475
I got another warning from the vice dean.

457
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,645
He said I'd even have to return
the scholarship money.

458
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,188
Mr. Sung.

459
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:23,233
For Constitutional Law,
I just need to study my lecture notes now.

460
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:26,320
But as for Prof. Kim's Civil Code course,
I'm missing the notes

461
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:28,822
on subrogation rights,
the most difficult part.

462
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:32,034
I bet someone
already photocopied the notes.

463
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:34,370
Tell me who it is.

464
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,581
That person asked me not to tell anyone.

465
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:38,957
Don't be curious.

466
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,210
Can't you help me out for once?

467
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,253
Speak of the devil.

468
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,301
What?

469
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:51,762
-I don't want to talk to you.
-Why not?

470
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:53,055
"Why not"?

471
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:54,473
Forget it.

472
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:57,226
Hey, I'm asking you. What's wrong?

473
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,978
I feel so betrayed.

474
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:01,355
I heard you knew about Bad FaMa's lawsuit.

475
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:02,982
I was trying to be considerate.

476
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,776
If you knew, you'd be all distracted
because you're so nosy.

477
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,861
Still, I can't believe
everyone knew but me.

478
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:10,322
I really wanted to see her clear her name.

479
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:12,616
-I know.

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,536
I felt like an idiot when I ran into her
at the court.

481
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:18,872
She was worried about my exam--

482
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:20,666
Ace it so you won't have to retake--

483
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,836
Obviously, I don't want that.
I want to ace the exam too.

484
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,671
-I really do.
-Then just--

485
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,047
Just do it? Don't you dare.

486
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:33,470

go to this school.

No matter how hard I study,

488
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:38,183
I just can't do it.
Those who give me false hope that I can…

489
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,644
Forget it.

490
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:43,230
I'm so desperate I wish
I was the vice dean's daughter.

00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:44,189
Kang Sol.

492
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:45,941
That's my name, Kang Sol "A."

493
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:49,194
I was hoping that "A" would bring me luck
and help me get an A.

494
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:51,905
Like a lucky charm.
That's why I wanted to be Kang Sol "A."

495
00:28:53,991 --> 00:28:55,451
Do you know what I was thinking?

496
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:58,537
I even thought it'd be nice
to steal the exam papers.

497
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:03,792
You passed the second-round judicial exam,
so you'd never understand.

498
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,003
So? You don't need my help?

499
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,217
This must be heavy.

500
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:15,137

00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:29,777

Make sure you go over the third precedent.

505
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,986

-Okay.

If it's because I testified…

640
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:41,548
You said you were looking for Dan.

641
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:46,803
Kang Dan…

642
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:51,558
volunteered at the orphanage
and mentored my son.

643
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,018
According to the director there,

644
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:57,939
she was the only person
my son confided in.

645
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,399
I heard they stayed in touch.

646
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:03,862
She was the reason
I moved to this neighborhood.

647
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:06,906
Has she really gone missing?

648
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,491
I haven't seen her at all.

649
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:10,410
Of course, she's in the US now.

650
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:14,289
How do you know?

651
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,875
I'm looking for her as well.

652
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:21,546
I did manage to get hold of her.

653
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:35,810
Yang Jong-hoon speaking.

654
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,103
<i>It's me, Kang Dan.</i>

655
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:40,273
Kang Dan?

656
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:41,566
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

657
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:44,944
<i>I heard you were looking for me.</i>

658
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:46,070
Kang Dan?

659
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,030
<i>Who is this?</i>

660
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:49,657
Text me your number.

661
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,327
-But that number--
-If you want it, let's make a deal.

662
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:54,203
You hate Prosecutor Jin.

663
00:41:54,287 --> 00:41:56,623
-Who put you up to--
-No one! I told you.

664
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:59,542
I'd never cut such a deal with anyone
because I'm a chicken!

665
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:01,669
Okay? What happened was,

666
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,923
those two reporters kept nagging me
to do an interview--

667
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:08,384
"They had no choice but to pass
the Lee Man-ho Act to make sure

668
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:10,470
such evil criminals
would never be set free.

669
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:11,596
Choi Jung-hyeok."

670
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,848
I'd never agree to be interviewed
by a reporter

671
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,392
who wrote an article like this about me.

672
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,943
I'll give you some time to think it over.

673
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:27,654
Oh, right.

674
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:32,575
The person who met Assemblyman Ko
and told him to propose the bill

675
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,410
was Kang Dan.

676
00:42:44,754 --> 00:42:45,755
LUCKY YOU!

00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:21,749
My gosh, she wrote down
every single thing.

683
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,167
And it's well organized.

684
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:26,838
Her notes were the reason
she could join our study group.

685
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:29,465
Why do you think
Sol B and Ji-ho let her join?

686
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:31,342
Maybe they knew who her father was.

687
00:43:31,426 --> 00:43:32,427
No, I'm telling you.

688
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,098
It makes no sense that she got a warning
with these notes

689
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,768
and got a 29 on her test
when her dad is the vice dean, you know?

690
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:42,186
Right, it makes no sense.

691
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:47,900
Oh, dear. You guys will practice law
and earn a living?

692
00:43:48,985 --> 00:43:51,696
Are you sure she's his daughter?
Did you even check?

693
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:53,197
Did you ask her?

694
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:55,700
Well, based on the photo
and the situation…

695
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,369
He has a point.

696
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:00,830
Then she should've aced
the Constitutional Law test.

697
00:44:00,913 --> 00:44:02,040
I know.

Are you all right?

701
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:34,322
Yes, I'm fine.

702
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,630
Hey!

703
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,510
I'm okay.

704
00:45:00,473 --> 00:45:02,016
-You should go see a doctor.
-No.

705
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,560
I have to take this exam.

706
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:08,898
You're not well enough.

707
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:09,982
I'm fine.

708
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:11,859
I can do this.

709
00:45:12,652 --> 00:45:13,861
-I have to…
-Sol.

LEGAL COUNSELING

711
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:22,286
Gosh, how inconsiderate.

712
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,956
She has no shame.
I would've preferred not to know.

713
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,958
Why switch to our class now?

714
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,710
Our grades will drop even more
because of her.

715
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:33,798
We wouldn't be worried about that at all
if it was actually Kang Sol A.

716
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:36,050
Sol's smarter than you.

717
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,719
It's always stupid losers
who bad-mouth others.

718
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:41,764
-Hey!
-Hey.

719
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:44,433
Study hard
so you won't have to worry about it.

720
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:47,395
Geez.

721
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,676
-Seung-jae.
-Hey, you woke up.

722
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:20,887
Did I not finish my exam?

723
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:24,557
You did.
You fainted after you finished it.

724
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,767
Gosh, thank God.

725
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,771
I'm sure you aced it.

726
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:35,526
What can I do
to write such perfect answers?

727
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:37,820
It's as if you can read
the professors' minds.

728
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:43,409
You're dehydrated from too much caffeine.
You pushed yourself too hard.

729
00:46:43,492 --> 00:46:46,162
You've been doing other things
on top of studying so hard.

730
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,834
The client wants a jury trial,
like you suggested.

731
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,920
REPLY TO YOUR LEGAL INQUIRY

732
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,632
You practically wrote an essay
explaining why you think

733
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,550
a jury trial would be better.

734
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:01,427
-This must've taken hours.
-Seung-jae.

735
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,931
Don't I need to get some rest now?

736
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,642
Sol! Are you all right?

737
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,101
You're not dying, right?

738
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:11,771
I knew one of us would fall ill
because of these exams.

739
00:47:11,854 --> 00:47:14,190
Why did you come here?
It's not even a big deal.

740
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:15,107
I'm fine.

741
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,528
Hey, let's go.

742
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,240
Since you want a jury trial,

743
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:25,326
it will be reassigned

744
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,870
to a panel-judge court
from the single-judge court.

745
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,789
Okay, let me know.

746
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,044
Is this Professor Kim's paper
on subrogation rights?

747
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:37,838
My gosh!

748
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:40,925
This is the info I was looking for.

749
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,928
Her final exam from last year
was based on this.

750
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:46,764
Yeah, it mentions one of the cases
she covered in class.

751
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:49,266
She'll probably tweak this a little
for the exam.

752
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,726
Yeah, totally.

753
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,852
Sol, you rock.

754
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,146
-You don't just take good notes.
-That's right.

755
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:01,445
By the way, you really don't want to know
who the witness is?

756
00:48:01,529 --> 00:48:03,197
There was nothing to "witness"

757
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,242
because Prof. Yang didn't kill him.

758
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:08,577
So, there's no witness.

759
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:10,871
So they're bringing in a false witness?

760
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,873
But if someone witnessed it,

761
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,751
it must've been near the mock court
or the media room.

762
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:18,045
If it was the media room,
one of the professors…

763
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,005
No.

764
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:27,263
The witness…

765
00:48:29,223 --> 00:48:30,057
It's me.

766
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:38,357
Is it really you? You saw it?

767
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,527
-Yes.
-It makes no sense.

768
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,237
How could you be the witness?

769
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,281
If she saw it, that makes her a witness.

770
00:48:47,283 --> 00:48:48,242
She says she saw it.

771
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:50,494
It's your problem

772
00:48:50,578 --> 00:48:52,872
that you trust Prof. Yang too much
to believe her.

773
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:53,789
What?

774
00:48:53,873 --> 00:48:56,876
I think he's capable of saying
he put sugar in Prof. Seo's coffee

775
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:59,336
when he actually slipped a drug in it.

776
00:49:06,802 --> 00:49:07,928

Hankuk Law professor Yang Jong-hoon's

779

third trial will begin shortly.

780
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:27,281
With the new witness
who claims to have seen him in the act,

781
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,117
many expect that
the trial may take a new turn.

782
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,036
You can do it, okay?

783
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,914
Just say what we practiced.

784

I'll make sure

786
00:49:52,515 --> 00:49:54,934
he gets a guilty verdict
and pays for all the damage.

00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:59,980
I'll show you
how capable your son is, Dad.

789
00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:05,986
Dad, I will…

790
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,740
make you regret

791
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:15,037
not being here to see it.

792
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:19,917
If you do a good job today,

793
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,337
you no longer need to feel bad
about getting into Hankuk Law.

794
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:30,052
We meet again.

795
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,056
It's nerve-racking
to be on the witness stand.

796
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:35,558
Good luck.

797
00:50:40,563 --> 00:50:41,480
Don't worry.

798
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:46,360
Today, the whole world will see
who killed your uncle.

799
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:50,656
I'm going to the restroom.

800
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,617
Does this guy know

801
00:50:53,701 --> 00:50:55,578
-you ripped up the pledge?
-Of course.

802
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:58,539
That's why I gave it to her.

803
00:51:21,103 --> 00:51:23,105
We have to stop her
before the trial begins.

804
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,401
If Prof. Yang can't stop Ye-seul,
you should…

805
00:51:28,402 --> 00:51:30,529
She made this choice,

806
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:33,115
and he wants to respect her choice.

807
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,744
Knowing that
she's about to commit perjury?

808
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,665
I understand you're worried about him
because of Ye-seul.

809
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:42,625
No, it's not that.

810
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,463
I never suspected Prof. Yang,

811
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:50,549
but now that Ye-seul is saying
she saw him do it,

812
00:51:51,926 --> 00:51:53,636
I'm thinking maybe it's true.

813
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:57,640
It feels awful to see myself
beginning to suspect him.

814
00:52:12,783 --> 00:52:17,121
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S THIRD TRIAL

815

Witness.

816
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:30,259
I'm too nervous right now.

817
00:52:30,343 --> 00:52:31,344
WITNESS

818
00:52:31,427 --> 00:52:33,512
May I take some calming pills?

819
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:36,599
JUDGE

820
00:52:36,682 --> 00:52:37,933
Yes, you may.

821
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:49,278
What are you doing?

822
00:52:52,823 --> 00:52:54,116
ACCUSED

823
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,703
Eye contact with me will make her
uncomfortable. Please understand.

824
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:07,004
Witness, did you see the defendant
slip a drug

825
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:11,258
into the victim's coffee? It wasn't sugar?

826
00:53:17,098 --> 00:53:18,140
Correct.

827
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,185
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

828
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:23,396
-Gosh.
-See? I told you.

829
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,189
How could he do that?

830
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,609
The defendant's life depends on this.

831
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:31,612
Are you sure

832
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,864
it wasn't this?

833
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:37,743
It was this?

834
00:53:41,997 --> 00:53:42,832
Yes.

835
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:44,708
-My gosh.
-Seriously?

836
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,919
WITNESS

837
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,381
Why didn't you come forward sooner?

838
00:53:52,174 --> 00:53:53,926
<i>"Why didn't you come forward sooner?"</i>

839
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:55,594
<i>If he asks you that…</i>

840
00:53:58,597 --> 00:54:00,015
I couldn't.

841
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,308
That's it.

842
00:54:01,392 --> 00:54:02,351
Why not?

843
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:05,438
-That's…
-Before you answer,

844
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,983
glance over at Yang Jong-hoon again.

845
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:11,026
<i>With fearful eyes.</i>

846
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,447
<i>Then the prosecutor will say,</i>
<i>"You took the oath."</i>

847
00:54:17,158 --> 00:54:19,201
Just state the truth.

848
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:24,582
Professor Yang said,

849
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:28,461
"You didn't see anything.

850
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:32,673
Take it to the grave, or…"

851
00:54:33,632 --> 00:54:34,800
Or what?

852
00:54:37,052 --> 00:54:38,762
He said he'd make me suffer.

853
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,806
-What?
-My gosh.

854
00:54:42,516 --> 00:54:44,518
-Seriously?
-I can't believe this.

855
00:54:45,811 --> 00:54:47,062
How could he say that?

856
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:48,939
<i>"He said he'd make me suffer."</i>

857
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:51,275
You have to look like you're about to cry.

858
00:54:53,777 --> 00:54:55,529
Good. Yes, that's perfect.

859
00:54:55,613 --> 00:54:56,906
That's it.

860
00:54:57,656 --> 00:54:59,074
You don't need to actually cry.

861
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:07,333
No further questions.

862
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,127
Counsel,
you may cross-examine the witness.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

864
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:28,187
Witness.

865
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:32,316
Please calm down.

866
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:33,901
Hold on. Don't ask me anything.

867
00:55:33,984 --> 00:55:34,818
-Please.
-What?

868
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:37,321
Gosh.

869
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:39,073
I can't do this.

870
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:41,116
You little…

871
00:55:41,825 --> 00:55:44,245
I can't do this as someone
who's studying law.

872
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,625
I really can't do this
because I want to work in law.

873
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:51,001
Witness.

874
00:55:51,085 --> 00:55:53,629
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I wasn't in my right mind.

875
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:55,756
-Hey!
-Order!

876
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:57,841
What's going on?

877
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:58,759
Witness.

878
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,971
Are you saying you lied?

879
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,394
Yes.

880
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:14,942
Witness.

881
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:18,571
You're changing your word
as you fear the defendant would retaliate.

882
00:56:18,654 --> 00:56:19,613
Right?

883
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,534
What I feared

884
00:56:27,538 --> 00:56:29,498
was the video from the spy camera.

885
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:36,046
<i>Do as I say.</i>

886
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,465
<i>He threatened me</i>
<i>he'd disseminate our sex video.</i>

887
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:39,383
DO AS I SAY

888
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:41,385
It terrified me.

889
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:46,515

I don't know whether Prof. Yang
put a drug or sugar in the coffee

892
00:56:57,318 --> 00:56:58,694
because I never saw it.

893
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:05,701
I'm sorry.

894
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:10,039

-Jeez.
-Unbelievable.

898
00:57:17,463 --> 00:57:18,297
I'm sorry.

899
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:25,763
Damn it.

900
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:27,056
Shit!

901
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:28,641
There he is!

902
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:29,600
-Excuse me!
-Wait!

903
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:30,976
Excuse me! Just a moment!

904
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,186
-Wait!
-Just a moment!

905
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:34,313
-No! He's leaving!
-Wait, just a second!

906
00:57:34,396 --> 00:57:35,439
-Wait!
-Just a moment!

907
00:57:35,522 --> 00:57:36,899
-Is it all true?
-Wait!

908
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:38,067
Excuse me!

909
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,818
-Hey!
-Hold on.

910
00:57:39,902 --> 00:57:40,819
Follow him.

911
00:57:40,903 --> 00:57:41,737
Wait!

912
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,411
Ye-seul.

913
00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:52,373
Ye-seul, are you here?

914
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:56,877
Sol.

00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:08,472

Don't think about anything. Just sleep.

00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,413
I'll sleep here, so think I'm not here.

919
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,415
It's okay, Sol.

920
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,209
I'll get my blanket.

00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,776
Yes, especially…

925
00:59:03,902 --> 00:59:05,946
today's trial, I must say.

926
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:09,992
Can I say something too?

927
00:59:11,535 --> 00:59:15,205
If my student has to wear sunglasses
in my class again because of you,

00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:54,912
I'll call you if anything happens.

933
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:08,842
On your knees.

934
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:10,677
Are you deaf? I said, on your knees.

935
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:12,221
Don't do this.

936
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:13,263
"Don't do this"?

937
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:15,224
Fine.

938
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:17,142
Then tell me.

939
01:00:17,935 --> 01:00:19,436
Who told you to do that?

940
01:00:24,024 --> 01:00:24,858
Me.

941
01:00:28,028 --> 01:00:28,987
You?

01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:31,490
-You arrogant--
-That's not why.

You little…

944
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:35,494
That is why.

945
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:38,497
Otherwise, you can't stab me
in the back like this.

946
01:00:39,623 --> 01:00:42,835
I'll pull out the knife
you thrusted into my back

947
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:45,712
and stab your arrogant heart with it.

-Don't do this. Please.
-Let go!

951
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:56,181
No, I can do this.

Ye-seul.

953
01:01:02,938 --> 01:01:04,314
People will forget what I did.

954
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:06,191
Actually, I'll become a hero.

955
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:09,486
For disseminating a sex video
featuring a hottie like you.

956
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:13,615
You're studying law, so I'm sure you know.

957
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:15,409
A fine, at the most?

You, on the other hand…

961
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:25,878
Your life will be destroyed.

962
01:01:27,212 --> 01:01:29,214
The video will go viral

963
01:01:29,298 --> 01:01:31,592
if I say it features a Hankuk Law student.

964
01:01:34,595 --> 01:01:36,430
I know I'm the perpetrator in the case,

965
01:01:39,766 --> 01:01:41,476
but you're the one who's screwed.

GALLERY

967
01:01:49,067 --> 01:01:50,360
How…

968
01:01:52,946 --> 01:01:54,865
How can you do this if you love me?

969
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:00,329
You're the one

970
01:02:01,496 --> 01:02:02,539
who betrayed my love.

971
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,044
CONTACTS

972
01:02:07,669 --> 01:02:09,755
Does your father know about this?

973
01:02:11,173 --> 01:02:12,007
What?

974
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,384
You shouldn't do this
for your father's sake.

975
01:02:21,683 --> 01:02:24,645
My gosh, you dared to bring up my dad?

976
01:02:24,728 --> 01:02:26,605
Ye-seul, how dare you?

977
01:02:26,688 --> 01:02:29,608
You've become awfully arrogant
since getting into Hankuk Law.

978
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:31,276
You need a lesson.

979
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:33,362
Let go.

980
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:36,073
Damn it.

981
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,361
Yeong-chang. Hey.

982
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:16,113
Yeong-chang.

983
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,577
Yeong-chang, no…

984
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:26,873
SOL A

985
01:03:35,674 --> 01:03:36,675
Professor Yang.

986
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:07,873
Something happened to Ye-seul.

987
01:04:07,956 --> 01:04:10,208
-Son…
<i>-Ms. Jeon, let me take you to the station.</i>

988
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:13,962
If she gets interrogated,
there'll be a lot of damage to you too.

989
01:04:14,046 --> 01:04:17,341
<i>I know it's tough, but you have</i>
<i>to look straight at your situation.</i>

990
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:20,510
Are you saying he may never wake up?

991
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:24,014
Why didn't you bring him in as a witness?

992
01:04:24,097 --> 01:04:26,141
<i>Prof. Yang seems to be so disadvantaged.</i>

993
01:04:26,224 --> 01:04:29,311
<i>I want to believe the blank paper</i>
<i>you handed in means your courage.</i>

994
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:30,729
He knows that.

995
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:33,982
<i>As he didn't appear in this courtroom,</i>
<i>it is dismissed.</i>

996
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:36,777
<i>-I bet something happened to him.</i>
-I think Seung-jae…

997
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,570
Isn't this Yu Seung-jae's phone?

998
01:04:38,653 --> 01:04:39,863
<i>Riverside?</i>

999
