COURT

2
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,651
Kang Sol.

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,445
You're not curious.

4
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,864
You're not curious at all.

5
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,365
<i>Was her name Kang Sol?</i>

6
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,701
-<i>Kang Dan's twin sister.</i>
-Subrogation rights.

7
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,080
A KNOU graduate who served time in juvie.

8
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,791
How did she manage to get into Hankuk Law?

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,460
She's really getting on my nerves.

10
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,800
She got in through the special screening
for low-income applicants.

11
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,637
Don't worry, sir.
It's not like she can do anything.

12
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,726
Oh, right. Yang Jong-hoon
was the prosecutor who sent her to juvie.

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,438
He was told to send her to jail,
but he ignored it.

14
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,735
Yang Jong-hoon, that moron.

15
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,987
How dare he try to bait me?

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,615
He's baiting you?

17
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,243
You must lock him up.

18
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,704
You'll lose that moron
if you let your guard down.

19
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,832
I won't let that happen.

20
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,586
I have a secret weapon ready,
so he won't be able to get out of it.

21
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,046
That's what I like to hear.

22
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,758
Defendant.

23
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,597
You stated you were in your office
at the presumed time of his death,

24
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,101
between 14:25 and 14:55, correct?

25
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,687
Yes. You're right.

26
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,442
JUDGE

27
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,450
I was in my office.

28
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,788
You should've come early.

29
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,748
It got very interesting.

30
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,335
Any other questions for the witness?

31
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,629
I do have one more question.

32
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,216
Did you mention the possibility of this
being a suicide?

33
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,845
Yes, I asked if that possibility
was completely ruled out.

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,305
Why?

35
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,933
When I saw Professor Seo, he was already
under the influence of the drug.

36
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,729
My head…
I feel like it's splitting in half.

37
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,692
VOICE MEMO 004

38
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,610
SAVE

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,872
YU SEUNG-JAE

40
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,206
YU SEUNG-JAE

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,546
Had it been a murder,
he would've mentioned the killer's name.

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,505
That's right.

43
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,132
And with that handwritten note…

44
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,842
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

45
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,927
Your Honor.

46
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,263
When the detective who found the note
suspected suicide,

47
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,807
the defendant firmly told him
it was not the case.

48
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,726
-Am I wrong?
-That was--

49
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,229
You're right.
I did say it wasn't a suicide case.

50
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,939
And I still stand behind that.

51
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,860
He mistook the witness
for Han Joon-hwi, his nephew,

52
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,655
which means he was in no condition
to explain his situation.

53
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,159
That is a good point.

54
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,452
Darn it.

55
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,620
No further questions.

56
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,667
Defendant, do you realize
that statement could be used against you?

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,001
Yes.

58
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,964
I can't turn a murder into a suicide
just to get out of this.

59
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,883
Okay.

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,594
Witness, thank you.

61
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,639
JUDGE

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,642
But you see, if I killed him…

63
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,896
I'd be happy if the detectives thought
it was a suicide.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,899
Why would I want to say
that it wasn't a suicide?

65
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,776
-What?
-Good point.

66
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,986
-That's true.
-My gosh.

67
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,321
Is he really the killer?

68
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,489
I'm not sure.

69
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,284
People are beginning to doubt it,
and reasonably so.

70
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,006
"An obligee may exercise the rights
belonging to the obligor."

71
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,215
The Civil Code, Article…

72
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,720
Article… 404. Article 404.

73
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,015
In order to exercise the rights--

74
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,142
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

75
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,103
-What brings you here?
-My case is going to trial.

76
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,107
Suspension of indictment is like pleading
guilty. So I'll prove my innocence.

77
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,609
If it's because of what I said…

78
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,819
No, you were right.

79
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,030
No, it wasn't my place to say that.

80
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,116
Professor Kim Eun-suk agrees.

81
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,118
What was his name? Mr. Han Joon-hwi?

82
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,954
He helped me a lot.

83
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,872
I see.

84
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,875
Everyone knew but me?

85
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,088
I wanted to tell you but was worried
it'd distract you from studying.

86
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,009
Because of me,
you were even told to repeat the year.

87
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,638
No. I won't fail and retake it
just because I was told to.

88
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,437
Ace the exam, for my sake.

89
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,481
Yes, I should.

90
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,024
I can do it.

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,738
I should do my very best.

92
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,158
Where was I?

93
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm the one who wrote the opinion,
and I even had a nosebleed because of it.

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
I can't believe Joon-hwi didn't tell me.

95
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,719
I should just blame my bad grades.
It's all my fault.

96
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,901
You can't sleep if you drink coffee now.

97
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,155
You must be exhausted. You should rest up.

98
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,242
It's evidence.

99
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,707
Witness.

100
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,087
Are you aware
that the defendant told the police

101
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,297
you're probably the one
who killed the victim?

102
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,676
Yes.

103
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,929
I'm an evil criminal, you know.

104
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,141
He probably thought it'd be perfect
to just dump it all on me.

105
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,811
Why did you go to Hankuk Law School
on the day of the incident?

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,732
<i>I was Mr. Seo Byung-ju's personal driver</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

107
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,821
<i>I always drove him to the school</i>
<i>when he had a lecture.</i>

108
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,324
That day,
I left as soon as I parked the car.

109
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,202
So you weren't on campus
at the time of the incident?

110
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,913
-No, I definitely was not.
-How can we trust you?

111
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,666
How do we trust the words
of an evil criminal?

112
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,876
WITNESS

113
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,844
-What's he doing?
-You can trust this ankle monitor.

114
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,599
I see. Because of this,
we can track your every move.

115
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,851
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

116
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,107
We have checked and verified
that you were near Mr. Seo's law office

117
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,735
between 14:20 and 14:55,
the estimated time of death.

118
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,821
Thank goodness I had this on.

119
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,406
Your Honor.

120
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,785
That day, the defendant
was also wearing an ankle monitor

121
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,288
to experience what it's like.

122
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,207
JUDGE

123
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,292
Why couldn't we retrace his steps?

124
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,336
He claims that,

125
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,047
by pure coincidence…

126
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,507
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,758
…it was out of battery.

128
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,969
Dead battery means it's not trackable.

129
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,139
-Does the monitoring center let it happen?
-No, never.

130
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,767
The Ministry of Justice isn't a joke.

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,521
That's because he's not a criminal.
He did it just to experience it.

132
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,064
Is that so?

133
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,108
I'm actually wearing one now.

134
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,528
So I know they strictly abide
by the protocols.

135
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,279
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

136
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,908
At the moment,
the battery is at around 25 percent.

137
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,119
And the monitoring center…

138
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,162
MONITORING CENTER

139
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,247
…is calling.

140
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,874
LEE MAN-HO'S ROUTES

141
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,835
If you don't answer…

142
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,795
JUDGE

143
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,712
MONITORING CENTER

144
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,173
MONITORING CENTER

145
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,217
…they keep calling until you pick up.

146
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,552
May I answer this call?

147
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,263
They'll send a probation officer
if I don't pick up.

148
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,180
JUDGE

149
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,515
Sure, go ahead.

150
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,309
Hello?

151
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,311
Yes, I'll charge it right away.

152
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,313
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

153
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,648
Why did he ignore this call

154
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,277
and decide not to charge it right away?

155
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,322
It was because

156
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,951
you didn't want your location
to be tracked.

157
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,495
Because it'd prove
that you were at the scene

158
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,582
at the time of the incident,
not in your office.

159
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,755
<i>It didn't look like</i>
<i>Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.</i>

160
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,799
<i>So what if he feels guilty at this point?</i>

161
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,343
<i>But still, he leaked it out,</i>
<i>not Seo Byung-ju.</i>

162
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,803
<i>I told you to be quiet!</i>

163
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,684
<i>It didn't look like</i>
<i>Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.</i>

164
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,107
How did you find out?

165
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>Kim Hyeon-jae and Choi Jung-hyeok</i>

166
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,030
<i>were the first reporters to cover the case</i>
<i>and Prof. Yang's charges, in depth.</i>

167
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:14,947
CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

168
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,159
<i>They wrote the articles based on the info</i>
<i>leaked by Prosecutor Jin.</i>

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,705
<i>And they covered your father's case</i>
<i>before any other reporters did.</i>

170
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,542
-It could be a coincidence--
-Naturally, it seems fishy.

171
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,793
I need to look into this.

172
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,756
Statute of limitations, five years.
It'll expire soon.

173
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:36,594
You must be very careful if you want
to get Prosecutor Jin indicted.

174
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,889
This was recorded in secret,
which means it was unlawfully obtained.

175
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,516
What have I been doing all this time?

176
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,895
You were barking up the wrong tree.

177
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,147
But it helped me discover this.

178
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,696
Counsel,
you may cross-examine the witness.

179
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,989
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

180
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,579
No questions, Your Honor.

181
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,791
Witness, you may return to your seat.

182
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,461
If there are no further questions,

183
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,797
we will wrap up here.

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,256
Your Honor.

185
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,550
I'd like to bring in another witness.

186
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,678
-Who is it?
-I found an eyewitness

187
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,640
who saw the defendant kill Seo Byung-ju.

188
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,558
-What?
-Seriously?

189
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,105
I'd like to keep the witness' identity
confidential until the next trial.

190
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,523
This is unacceptable.

191
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,235
Who is this witness?
You can't spring it on us like this.

192
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,278
The witness is terrified
that the defendant

193
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,533
would retaliate if any info
were to be revealed in advance.

194
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,201
The witness

195
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,704
couldn't come forward sooner
for fear of ending up like the victim--

196
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,166
If the info is kept confidential,
what about Mr. Yang's right of defense?

197
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,004
Well, the right should be guaranteed.
So, on the condition that

198
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:58,634
the defendant won't try to contact
the witness under any circumstances,

199
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,345
-please disclose--
-Then I'll probably contact the witness,

200
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,013
so let him have his way.

201
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,432
-What?
-Professor Yang!

202
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,933
-What?
-Why did he say that?

203
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,983
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

204
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,900
There he is.

205
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,861
Who is this new witness?

206
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,446
Why come forward now?

207
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,448
Will this witness be the smoking gun?

208
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,325
I must protect the witness,
so I can't say anything now.

209
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,702
See you at the next trial.

210
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,370
-Mr. Jin!
-Just a comment!

211
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,372
-Tell us.
-Just a comment, please

212
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,249
Say a few words as a prosecutor.

213
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,542
-Prosecutor.
-Tell us.

214
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,918
Please, just a comment.

215
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,003
Say a few words.

216
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,920
Wait, Mr. Jin.

217
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,088
Gosh.

218
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,885
He said this new witness
saw you murder the victim.

219
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,595
This will be the smoking gun.

220
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,972
Once he brings in this witness,
it's game over.

221
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,266
How could you say that to the judge?

222
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,602
How can we not know about the witness?

223
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,520
It is ridiculous, isn't it?

224
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,398
I agree that your client
is a total nutcase.

225
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,443
I have to say, this must be tough for you.

226
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,945
How are we going to prepare
for the cross-examination?

227
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,199
He means you don't need to prepare for it.

228
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,119
What do you mean?

229
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,079
He said this person witnessed the murder.

230
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,416
That'd only matter
if Prof. Yang murdered the victim.

231
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,711
He's bringing in a false witness?

232
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,505
Right, he must be pissed off.

233
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,715
Prof. Yang publicly humiliated him
that he'd be

234
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,885
the first prosecutor to be indicted
for publicizing an alleged crime.

235
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,388
Why did you have to provoke
the prosecutor?

236
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,016
Who did he bribe?

237
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,768
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

238
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,317
There you are.

239
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,612
Spare us a moment.

240
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,199
-Why should I?
-He wants to talk to you.

241
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,451
They seem busy, so keep it brief.

242
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,628
I'm sure you know who my father is.

243
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm going to sue Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u
for publicizing an alleged crime.

244
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,515
Thanks to you, I discovered
that I had been barking up the wrong tree.

245
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,975
<i>Is this real?</i>

246
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>The son of TOYGOODTOY's CEO is</i>

247
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,978
<i>-Yang's student?</i>
-What's this?

248
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,688
-You recorded this?
-<i>I got chills.</i>

249
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,732
<i>He thinks Seo Byung-ju disclosed</i>
<i>his dad's accusation.</i>

250
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,860
<i>So, that's why his nephew came to see me.</i>

251
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,989
<i>I hope he didn't do this</i>
<i>to get his father's revenge.</i>

252
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,491
<i>Be quiet. Man, I can't believe this mess.</i>

253
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,037
<i>It didn't look like</i>
<i>Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.</i>

254
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,331
<i>So what if he feels guilty at this point?</i>

255
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,792
<i>But, still, he leaked it out,</i>
<i>not Seo Byung-ju.</i>

256
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,627
<i>I told you to be quiet!</i>

257
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,796
You recorded this secretly?

258
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,217
I wanted him to know that my uncle
wasn't the one who leaked the info.

259
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,386
Who knew it was Prosecutor Jin?

260
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,306
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

261
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,517
-The cat's out of the bag.
-Once he's indicted,

262
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,521
I'd like you to be my witnesses.

263
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,189
What?

264
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:05,362
Even if Jin actually leaked all the info,
he won't be indicted.

265
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,073
Even your professor couldn't do it.

266
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,493
We can do better. We, as his students,
ought to make it happen.

267
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,494
I'll make it happen.

268
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,830
With this recording?

269
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,084
Are you guys really law students?

270
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,379
Secret recordings of others are considered
unlawful evidence.

271
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,923
They're inadmissible in court.

272
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,716
I know.

273
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,885
I should've partaken in this conversation.

274
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,013
Then you wouldn't have had
to come out in the open with this.

275
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,059
I recorded my conversation
with the two of you this time,

276
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
so it's no longer considered unlawful.

277
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,249
PROSECUTION

278
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,880
This courtroom of all places.

279
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,298
JUDGE

280
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,591
JUDGE

281
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,511
Prosecution.

282
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,428
JUDGE

283
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,013
Arraign the accused.

284
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,891
He's innocent.

285
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,226
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

286
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,481
Did you just say
the defendant is innocent?

287
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,152
Then why did you indict him
in the first place?

288
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,031
Had I refused to do it, they would have
replaced me with another prosecutor.

289
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,074
DEFENSE COUNSEL

290
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,411
The defendant did not embezzle
the company fund.

291
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,622
Some higher-ups in the prosecution
has the CEO's back.

292
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,874
He followed the CEO's orders
and took the fall.

293
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,420
Therefore, the defendant is not guilty.

294
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,754
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

295
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,139
You became famous after that trial.

296
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,100
PROSECUTION

297
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,685
I didn't want you to quit.

298
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,815
I hoped you'd never leave
the Prosecutors' Office.

299
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,067
You left before I did.

300
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,277
That's true.

301
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,615
Gosh, I thought I had no regrets.

302
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,285
But it feels weird to be sitting here now.

303
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,371
What will you do now?

304
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,625
You couldn't prove your alibi,

305
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,586
and there's a new witness now.

306
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,963
I'll look for a witness.

307
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,719
A real witness
who can help me prove my alibi.

308
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,681
You didn't have to come.

309
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,767
What would the doctor think?

310
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,435
I spoke with the school.

311
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,314
You'll take Prof. Moon's
Constitutional Law course.

312
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,899
What?

313
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,109
-The semester is almost over.
-Okay.

314
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,487
What are you talking about?

315
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,363
Why would you switch courses now?

316
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,033
It's better than not being able
to use my laptop in class.

317
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,952
Don't even bring it up.
Aren't you sick of it?

318
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,665
<i>Seung-jae, you went to the trial too?</i>

319
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,917
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

320
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,463
If you switch to that class,
everyone will find out

321
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,381
-that you're my daughter.
-I have to go.

322
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,260
Prof. Moon's exam questions
are from his books that are out of print.

323
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,346
Then get me those books
as soon as you can.

324
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,723
Okay, I'll search the entire country
if I have to.

325
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,941
KANG SOL B

326
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,195
Give me some time.

327
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,658
I'm not sure whether I should tell you,

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,576
-or--
-I'll give you some time.

329
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,578
But don't tell anyone else

330
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,539
before you answer my question.

331
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,877
That ring…

332
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,839
Are you going to keep wearing it?

333
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,560
Here's your coffee.

334
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,275
This and Kang Sol B's laptop were switched
in the cart because

335
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,526
they're the same model?

336
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,028
Then who put your laptop in there?

337
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,072
The person who took my laptop, obviously.

338
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,951
The TA said Kang Sol B's
was returned to her.

339
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:22,911
It's this guy here.

340
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,248
-But I have no idea who it is.
-Yeah, it's hard to tell.

341
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,585
With the cap and the mask,
all I can see is that it's a guy.

342
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,464
Oh, hold on.

343
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,223
I think I know who this is.

344
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,729
What did you just say?

345
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,192
What do you mean I'm the witness
the prosecutor mentioned?

346
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,861
You're the witness.

347
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,410
You couldn't tell the police
when they interviewed you.

348
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,874
That day, you saw that prick
slip something into Seo's coffee.

349
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,293
It was meth, not sugar.

350
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,836
What's with you?

351
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,340
I'm telling you that you saw it.

352
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,843
You're insane.

353
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,345
You're insane!

354
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,560
You're insane.
You've completely lost your mind!

355
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,563
And the spy camera too.
Why are you doing this to me?

356
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,232
What do you mean?

357
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,775
You're hurting my feelings here.

358
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,817
Yeong-chang.

359
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,319
We'll get married soon.

360
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,155
I set up the camera in your room
to keep you safe

361
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,865
because I love you.

362
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,706
You think that's love?

363
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,500
Of course.

364
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,382
Let's get married next year.

365
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,550
As soon as I get into law school.

366
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,016
But to do that, we must make Yang
pay for what he did.

367
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,020
-Didn't you see him mess with my dad?
-Don't let a personal grudge--

368
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,481
That bastard killed Seo
because of a personal grudge.

369
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,694
But he hasn't been convicted yet.

370
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,739
Presumption of innocence?

371
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,409
You're a law student after all.

372
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,454
Out of the people that left shoeprints
at the scene,

373
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,456
who else could be the culprit, then?

374
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,669
Ye-seul.

375
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,798
Why don't you get it?

376
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,177
It's not like I'm trying to frame
an innocent man.

377
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,599
That sly murderer is trying to get away
with a murder using his legal knowledge.

378
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,436
Let's teach him a lesson.

379
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,148
What?

380
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,941
What are you saying?

381
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,402
-A recording?
-You took it off already?

382
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,282
I'll call you back.

383
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,119
You know why I quit being a prosecutor.

384
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,455
Want to know why I became a law professor?

385
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,376
To make sure there are
no more scumbag prosecutors like you.

386
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,087
Remember that.

387
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,799
To win back your position
and teach again--

388
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,303
I must clear my name,
so I'll have no more of your antics.

389
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,597
Do you think you'll get your way?

390
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,516
We shall see.

391
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,982
Hey, Ye-seul.

392
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,528
Hey! What's wrong? Are you all right?

393
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,125
MY HUBBY

394
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,051
That was a great cross-examination.

395
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,764
You were awesome.

396
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,642
Really?

397
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm pretty awesome.

398
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,773
You believe

399
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,528
that Professor Yang
didn't kill him, right?

400
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,114
No.

401
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,407
I don't believe anyone.

402
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,413
I've been burned by someone
who had my absolute trust,

403
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,541
and it broke me, you know.

404
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,129
It still hurts.

405
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,591
Then on the witness stand, why did you--

406
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,219
I just told the truth, that's all.

407
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,849
I can't commit perjury
when I want to work in law.

408
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,146
Does it mean there's a possibility
that he actually killed him?

409
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,148
It can't be completely ruled out,

410
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,692
if the new witness is telling the truth.

411
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,325
You keep this.

412
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,628
KO YEONG-CHANG

413
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,380
I WILL NEVER HIT JEON YE-SEUL AGAIN

414
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,597
MY HUBBY

415
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,603
MY HUBBY

416
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,198
MY HUBBY
1 VIDEO FILE

417
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,078
<i>Don't forget</i>

418
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,623
<i>this long night we had.</i>

419
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,270
You knew it was Prosecutor Jin?

420
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,317
Unfortunately, what you sent to Ji-ho
is unlawfully obtained evidence.

421
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,908
Which is why Ji-ho recorded this himself.

422
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,830
You want Ji-ho
to sue Prosecutor Jin, don't you?

423
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,003
You were right.
One of my uncle's belongings is missing.

424
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,381
His glucometer.

425
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,425
They returned everything else but that.

426
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,136
It must be his next card
after the fake witness.

427
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:30,297
The president would like you
to apologize to Assemblyman Ko.

428
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,298
Me?

429
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,550
You humiliated him
in front of the students.

430
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,926
I just wanted to check.

431
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,429
It wasn't the right place for it.

432
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,472
The students were forced to be there.

433
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,564
-So you won't apologize?
-I suppose he won't sue me?

434
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,107
Sue you?

435
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,736
I'm hoping Assemblyman Ko
will sue me for defamation.

436
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,033
I take it that you want to call

437
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,243
the election law violation
into question again.

438
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,536
Yes.

439
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,044
I told the president
that we'd be violating

440
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,173
freedom of conscience
if we forced you to apologize.

441
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,469
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,096
For putting you through all this.

443
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,598
If you want to apologize to me,

444
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,559
just make sure you get acquitted.

445
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,645
The president

446
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:32,233
will fire you
the moment you get a guilty verdict.

447
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,652
You know that, right?

448
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,079
Seriously?

449
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,915
You won't attend his trials?
You, for real?

450
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,958
NOT EVEN CURIOUS

451
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,627
I'm sure you're curious.

452
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,213
It was like Pandora's box.

453
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,964
NOT EVEN CURIOUS

454
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,219
I got another warning from the vice dean.

455
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,389
He said I'd even have to return
the scholarship money.

456
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,932
Mr. Sung.

457
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,977
For Constitutional Law,
I just need to study my lecture notes now.

458
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,064
But as for Prof. Kim's Civil Code course,
I'm missing the notes

459
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,566
on subrogation rights,
the most difficult part.

460
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,778
I bet someone
already photocopied the notes.

461
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,114
Tell me who it is.

462
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,325
That person asked me not to tell anyone.

463
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,701
Don't be curious.

464
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,954
Can't you help me out for once?

465
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,997
Speak of the devil.

466
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,045
What?

467
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,506
-I don't want to talk to you.
-Why not?

468
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,799
"Why not"?

469
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,217
Forget it.

470
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,970
Hey, I'm asking you. What's wrong?

471
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,722
I feel so betrayed.

472
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,099
I heard you knew about Bad FaMa's lawsuit.

473
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,726
I was trying to be considerate.

474
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,520
If you knew, you'd be all distracted
because you're so nosy.

475
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,605
Still, I can't believe
everyone knew but me.

476
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,066
I really wanted to see her clear her name.

477
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,360
-I know.
-You know?

478
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,280
I felt like an idiot when I ran into her
at the court.

479
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,616
She was worried about my exam--

481
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,580
Obviously, I don't want that.
I want to ace the exam too.

482
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,415
-I really do.
-Then just--

483
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,791
Just do it? Don't you dare.

go to this school.

No matter how hard I study,

486
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,927
I just can't do it.
Those who give me false hope that I can…

I was the vice dean's daughter.

That's my name, Kang Sol "A."

491
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,938
I was hoping that "A" would bring me luck
and help me get an A.

492
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,649
Like a lucky charm.
That's why I wanted to be Kang Sol "A."

493
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,195
Do you know what I was thinking?

494
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,281
I even thought it'd be nice
to steal the exam papers.

495
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,536
You passed the second-round judicial exam,
so you'd never understand.

496
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,747
So? You don't need my help?

497
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,961

-Okay.

00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,202
volunteered at the orphanage
and mentored my son.

641
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,662
According to the director there,

642
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,583
she was the only person
my son confided in.

643
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,043
I heard they stayed in touch.

644
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,506
She was the reason
I moved to this neighborhood.

645
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,550
Has she really gone missing?

646
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,135
I haven't seen her at all.

647
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,054
Of course, she's in the US now.

648
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,933
How do you know?

649
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm looking for her as well.

650
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,190
I did manage to get hold of her.

651
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,454
Yang Jong-hoon speaking.

652
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,747
<i>It's me, Kang Dan.</i>

653
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,917
Kang Dan?

654
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,210
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

655
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,588
<i>I heard you were looking for me.</i>

656
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,714
Kang Dan?

657
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,674
<i>Who is this?</i>

658
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,301
Text me your number.

659
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,971
-But that number--
-If you want it, let's make a deal.

660
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,847
You hate Prosecutor Jin.

661
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,267
-Who put you up to--
-No one! I told you.

662
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,186
I'd never cut such a deal with anyone
because I'm a chicken!

663
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,313
Okay? What happened was,

664
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,567
those two reporters kept nagging me
to do an interview--

665
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,028
"They had no choice but to pass
the Lee Man-ho Act to make sure

666
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,114
such evil criminals
would never be set free.

667
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,240
Choi Jung-hyeok."

668
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,492
I'd never agree to be interviewed
by a reporter

669
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,036
who wrote an article like this about me.

670
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,587
I'll give you some time to think it over.

671
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,298
Oh, right.

672
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,219
The person who met Assemblyman Ko
and told him to propose the bill

673
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,054
was Kang Dan.

674
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,399
LUCKY YOU!

675
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,483

00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,393
My gosh, she wrote down
every single thing.

681
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,811
And it's well organized.

682
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,482
Her notes were the reason
she could join our study group.

683
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,109
Why do you think
Sol B and Ji-ho let her join?

684
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,986
Maybe they knew who her father was.

685
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,071
No, I'm telling you.

686
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,742
It makes no sense that she got a warning
with these notes

687
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:25,412
and got a 29 on her test
when her dad is the vice dean, you know?

688
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,830
Right, it makes no sense.

689
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:32,544
Oh, dear. You guys will practice law
and earn a living?

690
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,340
Are you sure she's his daughter?
Did you even check?

691
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,841
Did you ask her?

692
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,344
Well, based on the photo
and the situation…

693
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,013
He has a point.

694
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,474
Then she should've aced
the Constitutional Law test.

695
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,684
I know.

00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,296
Are you all right?

699
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,966
Yes, I'm fine.

700
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,274
Hey!

701
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,154
I'm okay.

702
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,660
-You should go see a doctor.
-No.

703
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:49,204
I have to take this exam.

704
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,542
You're not well enough.

705
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,626
I'm fine.

706
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,503
I can do this.

707
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,505
-I have to…
-Sol.

LEGAL COUNSELING

709
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,930
Gosh, how inconsiderate.

710
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,600
She has no shame.
I would've preferred not to know.

711
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,602
Why switch to our class now?

712
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,354
Our grades will drop even more
because of her.

713
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,442
We wouldn't be worried about that at all
if it was actually Kang Sol A.

714
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,694
Sol's smarter than you.

715
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,363
It's always stupid losers
who bad-mouth others.

716
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,408
-Hey!
-Hey.

717
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,077
Study hard
so you won't have to worry about it.

718
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,039
Geez.

719
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,320
-Seung-jae.
-Hey, you woke up.

720
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,531
Did I not finish my exam?

721
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,201
You did.
You fainted after you finished it.

722
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,411
Gosh, thank God.

723
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,415
I'm sure you aced it.

724
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,170
What can I do
to write such perfect answers?

725
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,464
It's as if you can read
the professors' minds.

726
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,053
You're dehydrated from too much caffeine.
You pushed yourself too hard.

727
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,806
You've been doing other things
on top of studying so hard.

728
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,478
The client wants a jury trial,
like you suggested.

729
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,564
REPLY TO YOUR LEGAL INQUIRY

730
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,276
You practically wrote an essay
explaining why you think

731
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,194
a jury trial would be better.

732
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,071
-This must've taken hours.
-Seung-jae.

733
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,575
Don't I need to get some rest now?

734
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,286
Sol! Are you all right?

735
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,745
You're not dying, right?

736
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,415
I knew one of us would fall ill
because of these exams.

737
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,834
Why did you come here?
It's not even a big deal.

738
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,751
I'm fine.

739
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,172
Hey, let's go.

740
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,884
Since you want a jury trial,

741
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,970
it will be reassigned

742
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,514
to a panel-judge court
from the single-judge court.

743
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,433
Okay, let me know.

744
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,688
Is this Professor Kim's paper
on subrogation rights?

745
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,482
My gosh!

746
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,569
This is the info I was looking for.

747
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,572
Her final exam from last year
was based on this.

748
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,408
Yeah, it mentions one of the cases
she covered in class.

749
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,910
She'll probably tweak this a little
for the exam.

750
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,370
Yeah, totally.

751
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,496
Sol, you rock.

752
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,790
-You don't just take good notes.
-That's right.

753
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,089
By the way, you really don't want to know
who the witness is?

754
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,841
There was nothing to "witness"

755
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,886
because Prof. Yang didn't kill him.

756
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,221
So, there's no witness.

757
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,515
So they're bringing in a false witness?

758
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,517
But if someone witnessed it,

759
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,395
it must've been near the mock court
or the media room.

760
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,689
If it was the media room,
one of the professors…

761
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,649
No.

762
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:11,907
The witness…

763
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,701
It's me.

764
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,001
Is it really you? You saw it?

765
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,171
-Yes.
-It makes no sense.

766
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,881
How could you be the witness?

767
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,925
If she saw it, that makes her a witness.

768
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,886
She says she saw it.

769
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,138
It's your problem

770
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,516
that you trust Prof. Yang too much
to believe her.

771
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,433
What?

772
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,520
I think he's capable of saying
he put sugar in Prof. Seo's coffee

773
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,980
when he actually slipped a drug in it.

774
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
MY HUBBY

775
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,702
Hey, babe.

776
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,794
Hankuk Law professor Yang Jong-hoon's

777
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,088
third trial will begin shortly.

778
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,925
With the new witness
who claims to have seen him in the act,

779
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,761
many expect that
the trial may take a new turn.

780
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,680
You can do it, okay?

781
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,558
Just say what we practiced.

782
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,573
COMPLAINT
PLAINTIFF SEO JI-HO

783
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,574
I'll make sure

784
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,578
he gets a guilty verdict
and pays for all the damage.

785
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,872
SEO GI-YEOL

786
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,624
I'll show you
how capable your son is, Dad.

787
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,630
Dad, I will…

788
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,384
make you regret

789
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,681
not being here to see it.

790
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,561
If you do a good job today,

791
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,981
you no longer need to feel bad
about getting into Hankuk Law.

792
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,696
We meet again.

793
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,700
It's nerve-racking
to be on the witness stand.

794
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,202
Good luck.

795
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,124
Don't worry.

796
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:31,004
Today, the whole world will see
who killed your uncle.

797
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,300
I'm going to the restroom.

798
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,261
Does this guy know

799
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,222
-you ripped up the pledge?
-Of course.

800
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,183
That's why I gave it to her.

801
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,749
We have to stop her
before the trial begins.

802
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,045
If Prof. Yang can't stop Ye-seul,
you should…

803
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,173
She made this choice,

804
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,759
and he wants to respect her choice.

805
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,388
Knowing that
she's about to commit perjury?

806
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,309
I understand you're worried about him
because of Ye-seul.

807
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,269
No, it's not that.

808
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,107
I never suspected Prof. Yang,

809
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,193
but now that Ye-seul is saying
she saw him do it,

810
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,280
I'm thinking maybe it's true.

811
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,284
It feels awful to see myself
beginning to suspect him.

812
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,678
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S THIRD TRIAL

Witness.

814
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,816
I'm too nervous right now.

815

WITNESS

816
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,069

JUDGE

818
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,490
Yes, you may.

819
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,835
What are you doing?

820
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,673
ACCUSED

821
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,260
Eye contact with me will make her
uncomfortable. Please understand.

822
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,561
Witness, did you see the defendant
slip a drug

823
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,815
into the victim's coffee? It wasn't sugar?

824
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,697
Correct.

825
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,742
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

826
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,953
-Gosh.
-See? I told you.

827
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,746
How could he do that?

828
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,166
The defendant's life depends on this.

829
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,169
Are you sure

830
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,421
it wasn't this?

831
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,300
It was this?

832
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,389
Yes.

833
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,265
-My gosh.
-Seriously?

834
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,476
WITNESS

835
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,938
Why didn't you come forward sooner?

836
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,483
<i>"Why didn't you come forward sooner?"</i>

837
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,151
<i>If he asks you that…</i>

838
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,572
I couldn't.

839
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,865
That's it.

840
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,908
Why not?

841
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,995
-That's…
-Before you answer,

842
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,540
glance over at Yang Jong-hoon again.

843
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,583
<i>With fearful eyes.</i>

844
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,004
<i>Then the prosecutor will say,</i>
<i>"You took the oath."</i>

845
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,758
Just state the truth.

846
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,139
Professor Yang said,

847
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,018
"You didn't see anything.

848
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,230
Take it to the grave, or…"

849
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,357
Or what?

850
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,319
He said he'd make me suffer.

851
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,363
-What?
-My gosh.

852
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,075
-Seriously?
-I can't believe this.

853
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,619
How could he say that?

854
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,496
<i>"He said he'd make me suffer."</i>

855
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,832
You have to look like you're about to cry.

856
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,086
Good. Yes, that's perfect.

857
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,463
That's it.

858
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,631
You don't need to actually cry.

859
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:51,890
No further questions.

860
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,684
Counsel,
you may cross-examine the witness.

00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,744

863
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,873
Please calm down.

864
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,458
Hold on. Don't ask me anything.

865
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,375
-Please.
-What?

866
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,878
Gosh.

867
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,630
I can't do this.

868
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,673
You little…

869
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,802
I can't do this as someone
who's studying law.

870
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,182
I really can't do this
because I want to work in law.

871
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,558
Witness.

872
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,186
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I wasn't in my right mind.

873
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,313
-Hey!
-Order!

874
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,398

876
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,528
Are you saying you lied?

877
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:52,951
Yes.

878
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,499
Witness.

879
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,128
You're changing your word
as you fear the defendant would retaliate.

880
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,170
Right?

881
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,091
What I feared

882
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,055
was the video from the spy camera.

883
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,603
<i>Do as I say.</i>

884
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,022
<i>He threatened me</i>
<i>he'd disseminate our sex video.</i>

885
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:23,940
DO AS I SAY

886
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,942
It terrified me.

887
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,072

put a drug or sugar in the coffee

890
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,251

I'm sorry.

00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,320
Damn it.

Shit!

00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,198
There he is!

900
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,157
-Excuse me!
-Wait!

901
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,533
Excuse me! Just a moment!

-Wait!
-Just a moment!

903
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,870
-No! He's leaving!
-Wait, just a second!

904
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:19,996
-Wait!
-Just a moment!

905

-Is it all true?
-Wait!

906
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,624
Excuse me!

00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,375
-Hey!
-Hold on.

908
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,376
Follow him.

909
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,294
Wait!

00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,930

00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,970
I'll sleep here, so think I'm not here.

917

It's okay, Sol.

918
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,766
I'll get my blanket.

Yes, especially…

today's trial, I must say.

Can I say something too?

If my student has to wear sunglasses
in my class again because of you,

On your knees.

Are you deaf? I said, on your knees.

Don't do this.

"Don't do this"?

Fine.

936
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,699
Then tell me.

937
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,993
Who told you to do that?

938
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,415
Me.

That is why.

943
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,054
Otherwise, you can't stab me
in the back like this.

944
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,392
I'll pull out the knife
you thrusted into my back

945
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,269
and stab your arrogant heart with it.

949

No, I can do this.

Actually, I'll become a hero.

953
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,043
For disseminating a sex video
featuring a hottie like you.

You're studying law, so I'm sure you know.

Your life will be destroyed.

960
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,771
The video will go viral

961
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,149
if I say it features a Hankuk Law student.

967
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,886
You're the one

968
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,096
who betrayed my love.

969
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,601
CONTACTS

970
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,312
Does your father know about this?

971
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,564
What?

972
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,941
You shouldn't do this
for your father's sake.

973
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,202
My gosh, you dared to bring up my dad?

974
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,162
Ye-seul, how dare you?

975
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,165
You've become awfully arrogant
since getting into Hankuk Law.

976
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:15,833
You need a lesson.

977
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:17,919
Let go.

978
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,630
Damn it.

979
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,918
Yeong-chang. Hey.

980
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,670
Yeong-chang.

981
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,134
Yeong-chang, no…

982
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,430
SOL A

983
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,232
Professor Yang.

984
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,430
Something happened to Ye-seul.

985
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,765
-Son…
<i>-Ms. Jeon, let me take you to the station.</i>

986
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:58,519
If she gets interrogated,
there'll be a lot of damage to you too.

987
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,898
<i>I know it's tough, but you have</i>
<i>to look straight at your situation.</i>

988
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,067
Are you saying he may never wake up?

989
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,571
Why didn't you bring him in as a witness?

990
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,698
<i>Prof. Yang seems to be so disadvantaged.</i>

991
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,868
<i>I want to believe the blank paper</i>
<i>you handed in means your courage.</i>

992
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,286
He knows that.

993
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,539
<i>As he didn't appear in this courtroom,</i>
<i>it is dismissed.</i>

994
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,334
<i>-I bet something happened to him.</i>
-I think Seung-jae…

995
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,127
Isn't this Yu Seung-jae's phone?

996
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,420
<i>Riverside?</i>

997
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,756
