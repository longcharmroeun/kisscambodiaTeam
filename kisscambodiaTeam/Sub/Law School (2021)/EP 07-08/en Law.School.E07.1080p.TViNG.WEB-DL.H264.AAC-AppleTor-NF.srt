He won't listen to me.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,282
You'll have to make him listen.

9
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,493
He only associates with you
in the prosecution.

10
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:42,080
That's the least you can do for me.

11
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:45,333
And I called

12
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:48,712
that airhead over.

13
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:52,883
Hello.

14
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:02,559
You need to take off your clothes
to work up a sweat.

15
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:05,020
You said you'd cooperate, so I came.

16
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:07,814
According to the accuser, Ms. Kang Dan--

17
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:11,943
Kang Dan? She's only doing this
to blackmail me for money.

18
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:14,279
You spread fake news
about your opponent to win--

Prosecutor Yang.

20
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,283
Aren't you busy?

21
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,661
You still have a long way to go.

22
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:25,082
I can't believe
you fell for that young girl's scheme.

23
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,959
Take your clothes off.

24
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:31,046
It is rather hot.

25
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:35,717
I need to see you.

26
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,594
I came to see Assemblyman Ko.

27
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:40,555
So you told people to spread fake info?

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,225
Let's sweat it out, then.

29

This is Yang Jong-hoon.

40
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:43,076
Hello? Hello…

41
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:53,879
The rice is rather firm today. Perfect.

42
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,172
I'm craving <i>ramyeon</i> now.

44
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,640
You should've come see it yourself.

45
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:08,768
I'll be a witness for the next trial,
and I've got no time to go twice.

46
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:11,396
Of course.
Our finals are around the corner.

47
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,107
So why is Professor Kang Ju-man…

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,359
He looks good on camera.

49
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,986
Go ask him. I'm curious too.

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,198
Is Sol A really Professor Kang's daughter?

51
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,451
Sol A looks much better in person.
Go ask her yourself.

52
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:27,537
What I want to say right now is…

53
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:32,792
may I have a bite?

54
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,419
After you throw in some firm rice.

55
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:36,213
Man.

56
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:38,507

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,841
CALLING…

58
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:46,097
Was that really the Dan I know?

59
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:50,143
How did she contact you?

60
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,062
Why is she calling you?

61
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:53,355
I asked around for her.

62
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:57,526
I thought I saw her last year
at the Criminal Law Conference

63
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:58,693
held at Harvard.

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,827
You can't complain later.
You said I can have it all.

65
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,247
You aren't the type who asks for a bite.

66
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,873
I do it for <i>ramyeon</i>.

67
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,710
Do you really believe that

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,630
she wrote her paper in middle school?

69
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:23,635
Wasn't she your rival in middle school?
Then you'd know what she can do.

70
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:25,428
Right.

71
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:30,308
It'd make much less sense to say
Professor Seo wrote that. How despicable.

72
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:34,479
"Despicable"?

"CEO Seo Gi-yeol of TOYGOODTOY,
a renowned Korean toy company,

75
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:44,573
took an extreme measure
during the prosecution investigation.

00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:48,159
According to Seoul Jungang Police Station,
Seo was found around 5 p.m.

00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:51,454
in his office
after setting himself on fire.

He was found by his son.

79
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,625
The police found nothing suspicious,

80
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,212
and they considered the fact that
he had been under extreme stress

81
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,506
due to the recent
prosecution investigation,

82
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,842

he committed suicide."

she didn't plagiarize his paper.

00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,231
I'm the one who's shocked.

223
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:50,983
Why were you at the women's dorm?

224
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,736
How did you get into the room
without the student ID…

225
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,032
I gave it to him.

226
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:01,869
What?

227
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:03,871
You've been secretly coming in?

228
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:06,665
She was scared to be alone
after her roommate took a leave.

229
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:09,377
I should be here for my girl
if she's scared.

230
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,420
Isn't that so, babe?

231
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:13,297
-I'll report him.
-Joon-hwi.

232
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,965
"Joon-hwi"?

233
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,761
I told you not to be so friendly with him.

234
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,557
You want to report me? Go ahead.

235
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:24,642
Do it.

236
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:26,936

Hey, wait.

238
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,533
Ye-seul gave him a student ID.

239
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,536
If anyone finds out she let him in
and stay the night,

240
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,703
she'll get kicked out.

241
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,914
What can she do? That's the rule.

242
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:49,166
Hey, just let it go this once

243
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,334
for Ye-seul's sake.

244
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:54,004
I can't let it go for her sake.
Why do you think she came to your room?

245
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,426
Man, this is so freaking annoying.

246
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,720
Why were you away?
Didn't you know I was coming?

247
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,057
I'm sorry.
I didn't think she'd sleep there.

248
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,644
-So you weren't at another guy's room?
-Yeong-chang.

249
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,521
Why are you avoiding me?

250
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:12,857
I wasn't. I got anxious and scared.

251
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:16,026
I thought you'd come by
only once in a while

252
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,278
when I gave you the ID.

253
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:19,029
If you come by every single night,

254
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,698
I'll get kicked out.

255
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,283
Let them, and move in with me.

256
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:23,701
Yeong-chang.

257
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,121
Give me the ID.

258
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,754
This is the last time I let you slide.

259
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:37,298
Thanks so much, Sol.

260
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:38,382
Let's go.

261
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,929
You can't leave like this.

262
00:19:58,777 --> 00:19:59,945
I'm sorry, Sol.

263
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:02,072
You couldn't even sleep.

264
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,158
I'm really sleepy.

265
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:08,329
Don't take this the wrong way,

266
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:11,207
but your boyfriend

267
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,292
seems a little dangerous.

268
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,754
To be honest, not a little, but very.

269
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:18,923
It's not like that.

270
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:22,676
I'm worried about you.

271
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:24,970
Obsession isn't love.

272
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:28,766
I said it's not like that.
Go back to sleep.

273
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,937
This is the last time I'll let this go.

You must be here in anger

So I just shared my opinion. That's all.

305

May I go now?

306
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,669
I checked with him again,

307
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,713
and he admitted to it.

308
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,840
But Jin said he disclosed
my suspected crime

309

Prosecutor Jin's side turned in

312
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,100
the testimony of the other guard
who was there.

313
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,643
He said he took it as a joke.

314
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,938
That you took his joke
a little too seriously.

315
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,148
Man, a joke, my foot.

316
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,192
He always manages to escape.

317
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:29,071
It was a stretch on your part.

319
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,827
their source was Prosecutor Jin,

320
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:37,413
you can't get him indicted.

321
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:45,504
Hot Americano with an extra shot, please.

322
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:49,299
I'll take one with one shot less,
so put that one in his.

323
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:50,676
I'll pay for both.

324
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,346

Well, I shared my blood with you,
so I guess I deserve some coffee.

326
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:02,563
What's the deal you made
with Prosecutor Jin?

327
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,233
What deal?

328
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:10,195
He's the first jerk
who locked me up behind bars.

329
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,905
Why would I make a deal with him?

330
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:18,245
It wasn't rape back then.

331
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:19,663
It was for organ trafficking.

332
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:24,168
I shudder whenever I hear his name.

333
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,753
Do you think I wanted to help him?

334
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,924
It's just because that prosecutor
asked me to tell the truth.

335
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:37,681
Man, I shouldn't have babbled
even if those reporters pestered me.

336
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:42,853
I enjoyed your trial.

337
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:45,564
You seemed to be
more into something else than the trial.

338
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:47,691
Don't lay a hand on my student.

339
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,277
Lay a hand on her?

340
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,112
I was just asking for a favor.

341
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,783
That girl has

342
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,286
an older sister.

343
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:04,124
And I really have to meet her sister.

344
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,879
You have to meet her sister?

345
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,596
Did you have to go that far?

346
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,558
You were almost spying on him,
filming and recording his voice.

347
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:24,520
I looked through everything all night,
and my impression is that…

348
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,396
COMPLAINT

349
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,403
…it wasn't my uncle.

350
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,574
That's what you want to believe.

351
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:40,536
I respect your reasonable doubt.
I would've done the same.

352
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:41,787
I'll look for evidence

353
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,665
to break your suspicion
and back up my argument.

354
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,586
By the way,
does Professor Yang know about this?

355
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:52,881
Yes.

356
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:59,930
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

357
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:12,150
Ouch. Gosh. My butt hurts.

358
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:16,113
Darn it.

359
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,995
Aw, man.

360
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:27,416
No way!

361
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,734
KICS: PROGRESS OF CRIMINAL ACCUSATION

362
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:56,403
You even wrote the complaint for me.

363
00:26:57,112 --> 00:27:00,365
That just proved Article 126
of the Criminal Code is useless.

364
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:05,537
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

365
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,497
Okay.

366
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,293
-You may go.
-Sorry?

367
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:13,754
You knew it wouldn't be easy.

368
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:16,840
You can't learn that in class.

369
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:19,509
You have class, right?

370
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:30,354
Goodness, is this the Ji-ho
who can't lose a second?

371
00:27:30,437 --> 00:27:31,355
What are you doing?

372
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:36,526
You're popular for a professor
without a class.

373
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,696
Goodness, I would've been at your trial

374
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:41,782
if it hadn't been for my baby.

375
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:45,202
Right, I heard Kang Sol
is the vice dean's daughter.

376
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:50,374
It's a surprise that
it wasn't Sol B, but Sol A.

377
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,043
I heard it's Sol A.

378
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:56,213
Everyone at school knows
because of this photo.

379
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:57,881
Take a look.

380
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:00,842
WITNESS CHANGES TESTIMONY
IN LAW SCHOOL MURDER TRIAL

381
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:04,388
With the plagiarism and all,
it'd be way more problematic if it was B.

382
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:06,598
-It's B.
-What?

383
00:28:06,682 --> 00:28:07,724
His daughter.

384
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,809
It's Sol B?

385
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,645
Wait, one second.

386
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:14,106
Goodness, then the plagiarism…

387
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,734
Was he involved with her plagiarism?

388
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,029
So that's why.

389
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:22,864
That's why he wanted to quit.

390
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,954
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

391
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,581
Your daughter was accepted here

392
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:33,375
and she got to take your lecture

393
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,294
after you talked to the school
and asked for understanding.

394
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:37,462
This is unnecessary.

395
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,505
DEAN OH JEONG-HUI

396
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:39,840
Please reconsider.

397
00:28:45,095 --> 00:28:46,054
I'm sorry.

398
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:49,266
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

399
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:00,861
It's me, Professor Yang.

400
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:05,365
The vice dean doesn't seem to have
enough strength to rip his resignation.

401
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:09,161
I should do that.

402
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:17,878
Ms. Oh.

403
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,757
Please help Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su
hold a successful special lecture.

404
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,972
We're practically forced to be here.

405
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:30,432
A special lecture, not class?

406
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:31,767
Is Assemblyman Ko that big?

407
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,644
Prof. Jung wants his connection
before he runs for presidency.

408
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:37,814
I'll be punished for offending him
if I skip this, right?

409
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,483
Offending someone isn't a crime.

410
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:41,109
-Where are you going?
-Out.

411
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,236
He'll mark you down as absent
if you skip it!

412
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,197
I can't believe how confident he is.

413
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,449
Go on. I have to do something.

414
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:48,950
Wait, you too?

415
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:52,579
Did you see that? Only students
with good grades can cut like this.

416
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:54,414
I'm so jealous. Gosh.

417
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:58,502
Anyway, Seung-jae hasn't been
talking as much lately.

418
00:29:58,585 --> 00:29:59,920
It seems he has changed.

419
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:02,547
Seung-jae has never talked much.

420
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:06,134
-To me, Ye-seul seems to have changed.
-Me?

421
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,553
I haven't even seen her around lately.

422
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:12,390
Don't worry.
You'll see me more often starting now.

423
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:18,271
You can go first.

424
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:24,903
I see. She was busy
getting lovey-dovey with him.

425
00:30:25,821 --> 00:30:27,614
I told you to just forget about her.

426
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:30,450
Don't be shot down.
You should ask her out.

427
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:32,494
Come on, she's seeing someone.

428
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:34,371
Go do anything if it isn't illegal.

429
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:37,249
-What? What if someone steals your guy?
-She'll die.

430
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,334
Gosh, speak for yourself.

431
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:43,964
Just take her from that kid.

432
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:46,174
That kid? He's someone's precious son.

433
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,009
Yes, a precious kid to someone.

434
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,970
I see, that's what you meant.

435
00:30:50,053 --> 00:30:52,889
-Just as how you're Prof. Kang's kid?
-What?

436
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:55,058
Why is he here? He doesn't even go here.

437
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:58,186
-He's getting ready to study here.
-What?

438
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:01,481
So he's a kid who's in preparation.

439
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:04,609
Let's make it quick
since we have a lecture.

440
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,028
I gave it a thought.

441
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,198
On that day, the teaching assistant

442
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:14,119
left my laptop in front of the cart
to leave it at Prof. Kang's office.

443
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,080
Where's Professor Kang Ju-man's class?

444
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,085
Then you took the laptop
that was at the very front.

445
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:25,589
I got those confused.

446
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:28,925
It was the same model as mine.

447
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,845
Your laptop is the same model as mine?

448
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:34,181
It isn't.

449
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:37,017
Well, that day,

450
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,936
my laptop was acting funny,

451
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,606
so I brought my wife's.

452
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,233
Her laptop is the same model as yours.

453
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:48,153
In that case, the laptop which the TA left

454
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,197
at Prof. Kang's office thinking it's mine,

455
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,199
should've been your wife's laptop.

456
00:31:55,577 --> 00:31:56,536
Give me an answer.

457
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,001
Why wasn't it your wife's laptop,

458
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,378
but Prof. Yang Jong-hoon's laptop?

459
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,391
-Did you turn the power on?
-Yes.

460
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,143
Mr. Choi Jung-hyeok?

461
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:23,063
Han Joon-hwi, I called you.

462
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,149
Right. Yes.

463
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:31,404
So you're Mr. Seo Byung-ju's nephew?

464
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,324
Yes, I've seen you before.

465
00:32:35,116 --> 00:32:36,701
Really? Have we met?

466
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:39,454
When did we meet?

467
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,915
In front of my uncle's place.

468
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:44,417
Don't you remember

469
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,088
asking him to help you
leak this information out?

470
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,929
CARCINOGENS DETECTED IN T COMPANY'S TOY

471
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:57,305
REPORTER CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

472
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:07,983
HAEWON DAILY, REPORTER CHOI JUNG-HYEOK

473
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,192
Nice to meet you.

474
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:11,236
SPECIAL LECTURE
BY ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

475
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,281
I got the privilege to stand before you
here at Hankuk Law School,

476
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:19,452
the brightest future law officials
of our nation.

477
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:21,246
It's a great honor,

478
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:24,624
yet my heart breaks as I stand here.

479
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,792
Yangcrates is here.

480
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:28,044
SPECIAL LECTURE

481
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:29,921
Because my close friend, Seo Byung-ju,

482
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:33,842
was brutally murdered
at the mock court he helped build

483
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:37,679
through his donation.

484
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:41,474
How could
"Hankuk University Law School Murderer"

485
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:44,644
become the most searched word?

486
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:47,814
I'm sure all of you were appalled as well.

487
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:54,195
Since the case is still in trial,
I'll refrain from mentioning it.

488
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:58,950
However, he was once a role model
to many junior prosecutors.

489
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,162
So I still can't believe

490
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:06,041
he was involved
in a drunken hit-and-run incident,

491
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:08,626
then went on to make a deal
with a sex offender

492
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:13,381
to let him off with feeble-mindedness.

493
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:17,093
What's ironic is

494
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:19,763
I proposed the Lee Man-ho Act

495
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:22,140
and passed it

496
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,560
to revise the article
on feeble-mindedness.

497
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:33,068
I'd like to give you a big hand
for bringing a revision on that article.

498
00:34:34,694 --> 00:34:35,570
Bravo!

499
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:46,915
You don't have to give me a hand.

500
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:48,750
I only did my work

501
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,462
-as one of legislators.
-Did you come up with the idea

502
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:56,299
for the Lee Man-ho Act?

503
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:00,220
Of course.

504
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:03,556
From what I know, a student
at Hankuk University made the suggestion,

505
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,225
then you only picked it up.

506
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,402
That did not happen.

507
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:16,736
So do you not know her?

508
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,155
She was in your campaign,

509
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:22,158
then reported your violation
of the Public Official Election Act.

510
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:24,285
Prof. Yang.

511
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,371
Sit down. Just sit.

512
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,584
There must be a big misunderstanding.

513
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:37,674
I understand how shocked you are
for standing in court as a murderer.

514
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:38,925
Don't.

515
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,597
I'm used to standing in court,
but I'm appalled by the fact

516
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:48,810
students who'd be studying
the Criminal Code are forced to be here.

517
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,103
Forced to be here?

518
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,105
I decided that

519
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:55,483
his lecture
is as valuable as my lecture, so--

520
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,278
It's a shame that
your lectures are only worth that much.

521
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:01,781
This was my class.

522
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:04,576
So the class should be irreplaceable
like mine.

523
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,211
Has he gone insane?

524
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:20,175
-That jerk!
-Yeong-chang, calm down.

525
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,551
Let me go.

526
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:23,344
-Yeong-chang, calm down.
-Calm down?

527
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,680
How can you tell me to calm down?

528
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:28,349
Did you hear what he said
to your future father-in-law?

529
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:29,642
He's a professor!

530
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:31,352
He's your professor.

531
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:35,148
-I haven't been accepted.
-You'll get in next year.

532
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,357
I know you'll make it.

533
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,151
What if I don't?

534
00:36:39,652 --> 00:36:41,446
Why? You want to leave me?

535
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:43,907
That's not what I meant.
Even I got accepted.

536
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,241
But you're smarter, so--

537
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,451
Exactly!

538
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:49,204
If you got accepted, why can't I get in?

539
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:51,498
That's why
my father treats me like an idiot.

540
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,418
-Ye-seul.
-Yeong-chang.

541
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,962
I love you so much.

542
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,965
You aren't allowed to treat me
like a nobody.

543
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:02,467
Darn it!

544
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,469
Are you crazy?

545
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:06,304
Ouch. Darn it.

546
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,891
Ye-seul, why do you let him
trample all over you?

547
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:13,019
Hey, who do you think you are
to meddle in our relationship?

548
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:16,564
You go keep your butt out of pain.

549
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:18,900
Ye-seul.

550
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:23,530
Where's Prof. Yang?

551
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:26,491
How does he know my butt hurts?

552
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,077
I never told anyone about it.

553
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,290
What are you saying?

554
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:39,837
I mean, I guess it's very stressful
for you to stay away from lecturing.

555
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:42,423
You wouldn't usually do that
in front of students.

556
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:44,592
What about you applauding like crazy?

557
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:46,386
I thought of getting into politics

558
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,304
just to revise
the article on feeble-mindedness.

559
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,558
But thanks to him,
I didn't have to do that.

560
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:53,518
Right.

561
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:57,146
What's this about a student
who suggested the Lee Man-ho Act?

562
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:01,109
And a whistle-blower
of the Public Official Election Act?

563
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,903
Everything you said was very dangerous.

564
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:06,072
I'm sure
it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing.

565
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:08,491
It's unlike you to give someone an excuse.

566
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,369
-An excuse?
-Yes.

567
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:14,789
An excuse for Assemblyman Ko
to sue you for slander.

568
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:16,749
Do you think he will?

569
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,875
What?

570
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:20,545
You sound like you want him to.

571
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:24,007
Is that it? Was that bait?

572
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:26,926
Goodness, it was bait.

573
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,927
But why?

574
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,056
Hey. I'll see you at the Copy Room.

575
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:35,727
Why should Assemblyman Ko take that bait?

576
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:40,148
Gosh, he never tells me anything.

577
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,319
<i>Come to your room right now.</i>

578
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:48,448
Didn't I tell you
to dismiss Yang Jong-hoon immediately?

579
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:51,659
Who do you think
helped you become president?

580
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,870
Yet you fail to control him
and bring me shame?

581
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:54,996
Ouch.

582
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,331
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:58,124
Are you all right, sir?

584
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,752
Hey, wait.

585
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:02,462
Yes?

586
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:10,011
Are you a student here?

587
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,596
Yes, I am.

588
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:13,973
-What's your name?
-Me?

589
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:15,808
I'm sorry, but why?

590
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:18,311
Where are you?

591
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:20,146
I'm Kang Sol.

592
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,733
Hurry up and come. It's really weird.

593
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:25,526
Yes, to your room.

594
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:27,153
QUESTIONS: KANG SOL

595
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:29,864
I brought witness questions
for your next trial.

596
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,160
You have an office.
Why do we always meet here?

597
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:37,497
Tapping devices hear you by day,
and spy cams see you by night.

598
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:40,541
He's the "Law School Murderer".

599
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,335
He's the biggest troublemaker,

600
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:44,420
so who knows what he has in his office?

601
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:47,674
When it comes to trouble,
you're the biggest troublemaker.

602
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,468
Look, you have tapping devices
and spy cams.

603
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:51,844
And speakers.

604
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:54,639
It's starting to feel like
you're slandering me.

605
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:56,808
Who knows what's planted here?

606
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:57,892
Don't worry.

607
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:02,105
Ta-da.

608
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,400
Yes, you're dirty.

609
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,610
-Goodness. Unbelievable.
-See?

610
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:08,986
What is it?

611
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:12,448
I need to check something.

612
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,034
Check what?

613
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:37,557
Hey, goodness.

614
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,142
I got you, you jerk.

615
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:44,188
You're finished now.

616
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:45,606
You're dead.

617
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,069
Did you know he had been recording you?

618
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,114
Darn it.

619
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:02,915
I don't feel very safe
about letting Kang Sol A take the stand.

620
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:05,334
What about her?
She's definitely on his side.

621
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,754
That's why I feel more anxious.

622
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:11,174
She might get emotional
and be led by the prosecutor's questions.

623
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,550
I'm more anxious about you.

624
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:15,219
Why do you have no confidence
and keep asking your client?

625
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:17,388
I never asked him too many questions.

626
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:20,600
And it's not that I don't know. I do know.

627
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:23,561
I wanted to make sure of everything,
so I'm just checking.

628
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:26,564
You'd ruin his trial
if you decided to check twice.

629
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:32,487
Anyway, we didn't approve of Kang Sol B
as our witness.

630
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,324
So why didn't the prosecutor
request to have her as a witness?

631
00:41:37,033 --> 00:41:39,994
Try to put your head to use
before you check with him.

632
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:43,623
Vice Dean and Kang Sol B
saw the sugar packet at the crime scene.

633
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:46,834
The prosecution wants the judges
to drop the sugar packet.

634
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,587
Why would they call Kang Sol B
and make her bear witness?

635
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,507
But I have to ask her
if she saw the sugar packet.

636
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,675
That's why they didn't want her.

637
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:57,845
Then we should have her as a witness.

638
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:59,972
You're very quick, aren't you?

639
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:02,099
-I'll make the request, okay?
-No.

640
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:04,310
Why not?

641
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,396
I don't think
they'll trust the vice dean's testimony.

642
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,023
So we should get her.

643
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,775
I won't have her in the court.

644
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:15,822

645
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:29,974
I thought you'd have me as a witness.

646
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:33,061
Did you find out

647
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:35,647
why my laptop
was at the vice dean's office

648
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,773
instead of yours?

649
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,902
Even if you found out the reason,
you wouldn't tell me.

650
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,614
If I were to have you as a witness,

651
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:48,117
I'd also ask you about the laptop
as well as the sugar packet.

652
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:50,161
But you won't tell the truth.

653
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:52,246
You won't have me at the witness stand

654
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:54,832
because I may be charged with perjury?

655
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:00,797
Because you may not be charged
with perjury.

656
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:06,135
You'll tell a lie as if it's the truth
even after the oath

657
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,888
yet leave enough room
to avoid getting charged.

658
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,641
I swore none of my students

659
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:14,811
will turn out to be
someone who takes advantage of the law.

660
00:43:16,104 --> 00:43:18,606
So I can't let you taint my career.

661
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:25,530
Let's meet over there
once you're ready to tell the truth.

662
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:27,657
I want to start

663
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,536
from the moment you went to see Prof. Seo
on the day of the incident.

664
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:46,467
Plagiarism.

665
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:50,013
It won't be easy to disclose the truth.

666
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,681
I understand.

667
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,310
You probably think everything will be over
the moment you admit it.

668
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:01,649
But no.

669
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,819
The moment
you choose to gloss over your fault,

670
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,530
the door to damnation opens up.

671
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,579
Like I told your father,

672
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:17,290
before I make an issue of this,
you should--

673
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:18,499
What could I possibly…

674
00:44:20,877 --> 00:44:21,836
do?

675
00:44:59,707 --> 00:45:00,958
What are you doing here?

676
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:02,877
Hey.

677
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:04,921
Getting some air.

678
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:06,255
I see.

679
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:07,799
Gosh.

680
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:11,177
I should be keeping my mouth shut
and studying.

681
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,179
That's how I can save myself.

682
00:45:13,262 --> 00:45:15,264
But I see a million things to meddle in.

683
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:18,351
What drives me crazy the most is

684
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,186
I shouldn't ask though I'm curious.

685
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:22,230
Why can't you do that?

686
00:45:22,897 --> 00:45:25,316
If I found out now,
I'd probably break down,

687
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:27,151
then I'll ruin all my tests.

688
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:29,612
I'll be finished
once I do badly on the finals.

689
00:45:30,404 --> 00:45:32,114
Right, flunking out.

690
00:45:33,574 --> 00:45:34,742
-That's not good.
-No.

691
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:37,703
I worked so hard to get in here.

692
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:42,500
There's something I'm curious about, too.

693
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,837
You're the A-plus guy
who doesn't have to study.

694
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:48,172
-If you're curious--
-May I ask?

695
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:52,468
Why did Prof. Kang bear false witness?

696
00:45:53,344 --> 00:45:54,262
Well…

697
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:58,683
Does this have something to do with Sol B?

698
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,561
One second.

699
00:46:04,814 --> 00:46:06,023
Yes, professor.

700
00:46:06,732 --> 00:46:07,942
Right now?

701
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,946
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

702
00:46:14,574 --> 00:46:17,660
I greatly appreciate your help.
Thank you very much.

703
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,496
We were just doing our job.

704
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,498
I'm glad we were able to help.

705
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:26,794
That's also the reason why
this Legal Clinic is here.

706
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:28,880
She's here.

707
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:31,799
-Goodness, hello.
-Hello.

708
00:46:32,592 --> 00:46:34,927
Thank you.
It's all thanks to your interpretation.

709
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:37,763
Her indictment might be suspended.

710
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:38,764
Suspended?

711
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,267
I was fined last time.

712
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:44,312
It's all thanks to you.

713
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:45,897
Don't say that.

714
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,940
I only did as my professor told me.

715
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,027
-That professor is here.
-I see.

716
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:54,280
Hello, thank you.

717
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:57,783
Thanks to you, she won't be fined.
Her indictment might be suspended.

718
00:46:58,576 --> 00:47:01,370
Didn't they tell you
to stop running the website?

719
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:03,664
How did you know?

720
00:47:03,748 --> 00:47:05,416
Wait, they had a condition?

721
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:07,960
Gosh, I knew it.

722
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:11,881
That's the reason why
I came to see you again.

723
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,884
You don't want to stop running it, right?

724
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:16,510
No.

725
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:19,555
I don't run it for my benefit anyway.

726
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:22,391
But it'd be much better
if your indictment were to be suspended.

727
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:25,645
Just let them indict you,
then be found innocent in court.

728
00:47:25,728 --> 00:47:27,813
-Sorry?
-"Just let them indict you"?

729
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:31,567
Have you been indicted?

730
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:34,946
She can be found innocent in court?

731
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:38,115
-Who's going to make it happen? You?
-Sorry?

732
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:40,201
-Can you be responsible?
-No, I meant…

733
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:42,787
You spoke words
you can't be responsible for.

734
00:47:44,622 --> 00:47:46,290
There's a need to bring up this issue

735
00:47:46,374 --> 00:47:48,417
since unpaid child support
is a major problem.

736
00:47:48,501 --> 00:47:50,670
So you're using a trial
to manipulate opinions?

737
00:47:50,753 --> 00:47:52,171
Who taught you to do that?

738
00:47:54,465 --> 00:47:56,175
-Was it you?
-Prof. Yang.

739
00:47:56,258 --> 00:47:57,301
I'm sorry.

740
00:47:58,886 --> 00:48:00,930
Please disregard what she said.

741
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:04,266
I'm sorry.
I spoke up without thinking it through.

742
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,394
No, it's all because of me.

743
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,357
Just repeat the year instead.

744
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,526
You didn't learn anything from me.

745
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:14,860
You better retake it.

746
00:48:20,992 --> 00:48:22,118
Ouch.

747
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:24,412
What's wrong?

748
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:26,831
He wants me to repeat the year? Nonsense.

749
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:28,791
Someone told you to flunk out?

750
00:48:28,874 --> 00:48:30,668
Just go on your way.

751
00:48:31,335 --> 00:48:33,170
Let's get ready for Prof. Yang's trial.

752
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:35,089
-Make some time--
-Go do it alone.

753
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:36,424
I don't have to do this.

754
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:37,925
You suggested we do this.

755
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:39,260
I'm not going to do it.

756
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:42,221
Prof. Yang is even eviler than Lee Man-ho.

757
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:43,389
He's the devil.

758
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,518
-And the trial?
-I'm not going.

759
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:50,187
If you fail to appear, there's a fine--

760
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:51,480
I'll just pay the fine.

761
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:54,817
You won't see me, Kang Sol,
at that witness stand.

762
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,152
"Oath.

763
00:48:56,235 --> 00:48:57,153
I solemnly affirm

764
00:48:57,236 --> 00:49:00,322
that I will tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

765
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:02,742
I understand that
I would be committing perjury

766
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,410
if I said anything untruthful."

767
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:14,795
Your footprint wasn't found on the scene,

768
00:49:14,879 --> 00:49:17,089
but you volunteered to be a testifier.

769
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:19,550
-Yes.
-Why?

770
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:22,386
Because I was sure
Prof. Yang was innocent, but…

771
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:23,971
But?

772
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:27,767
To be honest, I'm not so sure anymore.

773
00:49:30,686 --> 00:49:32,730
I really wish I could say that.

774
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:33,647
WITNESS

775
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:36,192
But I'm still 100 percent sure
he didn't kill him.

776
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:37,359
Witness.

777
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:39,904
I really didn't want to be sitting here,

778
00:49:39,987 --> 00:49:42,364
but I had no other choice
because I'm that sure.

779
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:44,033
Why is she so pouty?

780
00:49:44,116 --> 00:49:45,826
She has all the reasons to pout.

781
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,578
But she still showed up.

782
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:49,455
I don't quite understand.

783
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:51,665
He died of methamphetamine overdose.

784
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:52,875
The defendant's fingerprints

785
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:56,378
were found on the meth sachet,
the coffee cup, and lid.

786
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:58,130
How can you be sure he's innocent?

787
00:49:58,214 --> 00:50:01,634
Even if his fingerprints were found
on the meth sachet and the coffee cup,

788
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:05,096
it's not like anybody saw Prof. Yang
put the meth in his coffee, right?

789
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:06,931
It's not like there's an eyewitness.

790
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:08,099
Only I ask questions.

791
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,351
You'll just answer.

792
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:11,685
Okay.

793
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:14,021
Witness.

794
00:50:15,106 --> 00:50:17,108
You were sent
to a juvenile detention center

795
00:50:17,191 --> 00:50:18,984
for assault back in high school, correct?

796
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:24,365
And the defendant was the prosecutor.

797
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:25,950
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

798
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:29,245
-Really?
-Objection--

799
00:50:29,328 --> 00:50:31,914
-Objection!
-The witness cannot make an objection.

800
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:35,668
Your Honor,

801
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:37,211
I have no idea why

802
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:40,297
the prosecutor brought up something
that has nothing to do with this trial.

803
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:41,465
No.

804
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:43,884
Her conviction
of the defendant's innocence

805
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:46,137
is contrary to the evidence
proving his guilt.

806
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,306
This question is necessary
to break the credibility of her testimony.

807
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:51,725
Continue.

808
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:54,103
Back then,

809
00:50:54,186 --> 00:50:57,773
the defendant ignored the victim's request
to have you punished severely

810
00:50:57,857 --> 00:51:00,901
and punished you lightly
to the juvenile detention center

811
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:02,778
instead of criminal punishment.

812
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:05,114
Well, the victims were--

813
00:51:05,197 --> 00:51:06,532
Please answer yes or no.

814
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,411
-Yes.
-And you are taking his side today

815
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:12,580
because he showed you mercy, correct?

816
00:51:12,663 --> 00:51:14,915
-I am not taking his side.
-Answer yes or no.

817
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:16,125
Yes…

818
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:18,836
or no is not necessary
when the witness answers.

819
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:23,799
Would you still be sure of his innocence
if you were sentenced criminally,

820
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:25,509
in other words, more severely?

821
00:51:26,385 --> 00:51:27,344
No, right?

822
00:51:27,428 --> 00:51:29,305
-I'm not sure if--
-That's all.

823
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:39,690
What?

824
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:41,400
About four years ago,

825
00:51:41,483 --> 00:51:44,320
do you remember how
the CEO of TOYGOODTOY killed himself?

826
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:46,530
A few days ago,

827
00:51:46,614 --> 00:51:49,491
Seo Byung-ju's nephew
came and asked me about it.

828
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:50,743
The witness right there?

829
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:51,869
Yes.

830
00:51:53,412 --> 00:51:54,246
Witness.

831
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,706
WITNESS

832
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:58,417
Why are you smiling?

833
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,129
I remember how I almost ended up
sitting there as a defendant, too.

834
00:52:02,755 --> 00:52:05,216
You tried to indict me
as an accomplice to him--

835
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:09,220
You said you did not see
the sugar packet at the crime scene.

836
00:52:09,887 --> 00:52:10,804
No.

837
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:12,598
But I was busy checking on my uncle--

838
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:14,642
-Answer yes or no--
-It's not necessary.

839
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:17,603
I'm the one
who told the witness before me.

840
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:21,607
But if you still want me to…

841
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:23,317
yes.

842
00:52:25,903 --> 00:52:30,407
Your Honor, the witness was there
after Professor Kang Ju-man came by.

843
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:33,202
If he still did not see
the sugar packet there,

844
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:36,121
it lowers the reliability
of Professor Kang Ju-man's testimony

845
00:52:36,205 --> 00:52:38,832
on how he brought sugar
to the crime scene.

846
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:42,544
I understand how you tried very hard
to destroy the credibility of the sugar.

847
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:44,046
Just because I didn't see it

848
00:52:44,129 --> 00:52:46,298
-doesn't mean nobody else did.
-I rest my case.

849
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:47,216
Oddly enough,

850
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:50,844
you didn't request the one who saw
the sugar packet as your witness.

851
00:52:50,928 --> 00:52:52,513
I was finished questioning him.

852
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:54,682
Please delete his final remark
from the record.

853
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:57,434
I'll say it during the cross-examination.
It's unnecessary.

854
00:52:57,518 --> 00:52:58,644
JUDGE

855
00:52:58,727 --> 00:53:00,646
You let the prosecutor toy you around,

856
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:02,731
but look at how he's playing with him.

857
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:04,650
Defense counsel, cross-examine.

858
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:07,278
Keep a good eye on him.
This is how you'll learn.

859
00:53:07,903 --> 00:53:09,405
You won't even ask questions.

860
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,495
<i>No broadcasting scheduled for today?</i>

861
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:21,709
<i>Not in the mood.</i>

862
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:24,878
It's on the subrogation right.

863
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:30,509
Ms. Kang Sol?

864
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:35,347
Why didn't she call us a bit later?

865
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:43,731
What brings you here?

866
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,316
Let's go inside.

867
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:56,535
I'm finished.

868
00:53:57,578 --> 00:53:59,455
Defense counsel, cross-examine.

869
00:54:00,664 --> 00:54:01,707
Let me do it.

870
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:05,002
I'd be grateful.

871
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:07,796
Your Honor.

872
00:54:10,632 --> 00:54:11,967
Yes, I just got here, Father.

873
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:16,180
I'll call you after the trial.

874
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:21,612
I'll begin questioning.

875
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:26,117
JUDGE

876
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,201
Witness.

877
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:30,371
You once came to me with this.

878
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:33,291
Your Honor, the evidence wasn't
a part of the main examination.

879
00:54:33,374 --> 00:54:34,876
I request to question him

880
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,378
on an issue that wasn't a part
of the main examination.

881
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:41,257
Are we going to see something new
with every single witness?

882
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,177
Many aspects weren't disclosed
during the investigation.

883
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,344
What is he…

884
00:54:45,428 --> 00:54:46,804
Permission granted.

885
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:52,560
Strictly speaking,

886
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:54,645
we're allowed to only cross-examine

887
00:54:54,729 --> 00:54:57,148
on things mentioned
during the main examination.

888
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:59,442
Article 76.1,
Regulation on Criminal Procedure.

889
00:54:59,525 --> 00:55:02,236
The judge just granted me permission
to question him

890
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,822
on something not mentioned
in the main examination.

891
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:10,495
Therefore, this will be considered
as a main examination,

892
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:13,039
which forbids me
from asking leading questions.

893
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:16,542
Defendant. This is not a lecture hall.

894
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:17,752
Yes, it's a courtroom.

895
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:21,714
Look at how he couldn't help
but give a lecture.

896
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:23,883
Listen up.

897
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:27,094
Then let me question you on the aspects

898
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:29,555
the prosecution overlooked.

899
00:55:31,557 --> 00:55:33,309
Why did you come to me with this?

900
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:37,146
SUMMER BREAK, 2020

901
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,233
You want to make an accusation
against Prof. Seo Byung-ju?

902
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,610
Article 126, the Criminal Code.

903
00:55:42,693 --> 00:55:45,112
I want to accuse him
for publicizing suspected crime.

904
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:47,865
Prof. Seo publicized
your dad's accusation as a prosecutor

905
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:50,117
then caused him to take his own life?

906
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,079
Yes. If you saw the files,
I'm sure you'd know--

907
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:56,040
Prosecutors are never indicted
for publicizing suspected crimes,

908
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:56,999
not even once.

909
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,417
Are you aware of that?

910
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:01,045
-Yes.
-And it'll never be easy.

911
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:03,714
I'm aware of that.
That's why I came to you--

912
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:04,715
Why me?

913
00:56:06,092 --> 00:56:08,803
Tell me a reason why you need me
to get your revenge.

914
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:13,891
I needed your help for my revenge.

915
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:15,560
A revenge against who?

916
00:56:16,352 --> 00:56:17,603
Professor Seo Byung-ju.

917
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:19,855
He killed my father.

918
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:21,774
-What?
-Really?

919
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:23,526
What on earth is this now?

920
00:56:24,944 --> 00:56:26,612
-Seriously?
-He killed him?

921
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:28,447
-Did you know about this?
-No.

922
00:56:29,073 --> 00:56:30,575
Order.

923
00:56:32,702 --> 00:56:34,537
Witness, continue.

924
00:56:40,334 --> 00:56:41,586
My father…

925
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:44,422
<i>He was the CEO of a toy company.</i>

926
00:56:44,505 --> 00:56:46,883
<i>I wonder if you remember TOYGOODTOY.</i>

927
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:49,468
Mr. Seo, this is bad.

928
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:52,555
<i>Then someone said</i>
<i>carcinogens were detected in his products.</i>

929
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,641
Apologize to the children!

930
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:57,643
-Apologize!
-Stop using carcinogens!

931
00:56:57,727 --> 00:57:00,479
<i>News articles poured out,</i>
<i>and his name trended online.</i>

932
00:57:00,563 --> 00:57:02,315
<i>Protests and demands of compensation…</i>

933
00:57:02,398 --> 00:57:03,274
FUN WORLD OF TOYS

934
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:05,234
<i>But that's probably all you remember.</i>

935
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:08,362
<i>After the investigation,</i>

936
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:11,657
<i>none of his toys included</i>
<i>a toxic level of cancer-causing agents.</i>

937
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,253
<i>My father lost his reputation</i>
<i>and was framed unfairly.</i>

938
00:57:27,173 --> 00:57:29,425
<i>He took his own life</i>
<i>after he lost everything.</i>

939
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,312
-Objection.
-Of course you'd object.

940
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:44,231
The Korean law guarantees
the presumption of innocence.

941
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:47,944
So how was the witness's father framed
because of a false accusation?

942
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:50,363
Before the investigation was completed,

943
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:53,199
the media heard of his accusation
then reported on it.

944
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:07,171
After my father passed away,
I swore to avenge his death

945
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:10,049
on Prof. Seo Byung-ju,

946
00:58:10,132 --> 00:58:12,051
who killed him
by leaking out his accusation.

947
00:58:13,094 --> 00:58:17,014
Are you saying Seo Byung-ju is an enemy
who killed your father?

948
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,724
Your Honor, he's leading the witness.

949
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:20,434
What exactly am I trying to get to?

950
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:23,145
He's trying to point out
the witness's resentment

951
00:58:23,229 --> 00:58:25,856
to prove the witness has
a stronger motive than him…

952
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,027
Come to think about it,

953
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:32,697
the witness does have
a much stronger motive

954
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,906
to murder the victim.

955
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:43,958
Did you tell any investigators
about your relationship with Seo Byung-ju?

956
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:45,710
I never had a chance to.

957
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:46,877
No one asked.

958
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:48,337
No one asked?

959
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,841
The basic step in murder investigation

960
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:53,801
is finding hateful relationships
of the victim.

961
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:57,430
I guess they were set
on having you as the culprit.

962
00:58:57,513 --> 00:58:59,390
-Objection!
-And I agree.

963
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:02,435
Your Honor.

964
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:04,937
The witness is sharing an opinion

965
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:07,606
and a very personal opinion he has of me,
not facts.

966
00:59:08,566 --> 00:59:11,694
Witness, only provide factual testimonies.

967
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:14,739
Do not share your personal opinions

968
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,491
such as how you could've been
sitting here in my place

969
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:19,076
if they asked you one question

970
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,079
before they began to design a whole story
on my motive of murder.

971
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:24,707
Come to my office
to tell me such personal opinions.

972
00:59:28,794 --> 00:59:30,296
Then I have no choice but to ask.

973
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:33,049
Seo Byung-ju.

974
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:39,805
Did you kill him?

975
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:48,147
Is this real?

976
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:52,068
The son of TOYGOODTOY's CEO
is Yang's student? I got chills.

977
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:55,654
He thinks Seo Byung-ju disclosed
his dad's accusation.

978
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:59,533
So that's why his nephew came to see me.

979
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:02,953
I hope he didn't do this
to get revenge for his father.

980
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:05,081
If he did,
he totally killed the wrong man.

981
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:05,998
Be quiet.

982
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:10,586
Man, I can't believe this mess.

983
01:00:10,669 --> 01:00:14,715
It didn't look like
Prosecutor Jin felt guilty at all.

984
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,759
So what if he feels guilty at this point?

985
01:00:16,842 --> 01:00:19,178
But still, he leaked it out,
not Seo Byung-ju.

986
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:20,471
I told you to be quiet!

987
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:32,775
<i>Then I have no choice but to ask.</i>

988
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:35,486
Seo Byung-ju.

989
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:37,404
Did you kill him?

990
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:43,577
I didn't need to.

991
01:00:44,328 --> 01:00:45,579
You didn't need to?

992
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:48,499
It was the day my father died,

993
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:51,210
so I went to tell him
I'll get my revenge by the law.

994
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,217
My nephew, you're here.

995
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,860
You aren't my nephew.

996
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:18,112
You're my son.

997
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:24,118
My son.

998
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:28,789
Do you know how much…

999
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:32,585
I love you?

1000
01:01:35,087 --> 01:01:35,921
I do.

1001
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:45,556
Please don't forget that…

1002
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:49,518
my son.

1003
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,026
Seeing him high on drugs

1004
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:00,446
seemed worse than his death.

1005
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:06,744
You left him there
knowing that he was on drugs?

1006
01:02:06,827 --> 01:02:08,204
Because he was on drugs.

1007
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:11,373
I couldn't call 911,

1008
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:15,044
so I called a friend of mine at school
who used to be a doctor.

1009
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:16,462
SEO JI-HO

1010
01:02:16,545 --> 01:02:17,963
But he didn't pick up.

1011
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:19,673
Prosecution.

1012
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:24,261
The witness held a grudge on the victim
and witnessed him intoxicated.

1013
01:02:24,345 --> 01:02:27,014
Don't you find
the record of statement on Seo Ji-ho

1014
01:02:27,097 --> 01:02:28,724
to be a bit too insufficient?

1015
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,269
Yes, well…

1016
01:02:33,062 --> 01:02:36,815
Since the defendant fed coffee with drug
to the victim,

1017
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:40,402
I thought it's natural for the witness
to see the victim intoxicated.

1018
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:41,779
It wasn't drugs, it's sugar!

1019
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:42,780
Defense counsel.

1020
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:46,200
I knew we needed to have Kang Sol B here.

1021
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:47,326
Defense counsel.

1022
01:02:47,409 --> 01:02:52,289
You stated you were in your office
at the presumed time of his death,

1023
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:55,501
between 14:25 and 14:55, correct?

1024
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:57,503
Yes.

1025
01:02:58,128 --> 01:03:02,591
2:25 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

1026
01:03:09,723 --> 01:03:10,724
SEO JI-HO

1027
01:03:21,527 --> 01:03:22,528
<i>You're right.</i>

1028
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:28,826
JUDGE

1029
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,043
I was in my office.

1030
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:06,995
Subtitle translation by Eun Sook Youn

1031
01:04:15,581 --> 01:04:17,833
You weren't there
at the time of the incident?

1032
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:22,087
Your Honor. I found an eyewitness
who saw the defendant kill Seo Byung-ju.

1033
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:24,882
<i>People are beginning to doubt it,</i>
<i>and reasonably so.</i>

1034
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:26,425
I never suspected Prof. Yang.

1035
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:28,927
It feels awful to see myself
beginning to suspect him.

1036
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,513
<i>Who do you think the witness is?</i>

1037
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:33,307
Hold on.

1038
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,560
<i>Does it mean there's a possibility</i>
<i>that Prof. Yang actually killed him?</i>

1039
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:39,480
Seung-jae, what happened to you that day?

1040
01:04:39,563 --> 01:04:42,274
<i>He said this new witness</i>
<i>saw you murder the victim.</i>

1041
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:43,734
<i>He's sitting in this court.</i>

1042
01:04:43,817 --> 01:04:45,110
<i>It's game over.</i>

1043
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:47,821
<i>When you actually saw that,</i>
<i>you got out of control?</i>

1044
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,331
