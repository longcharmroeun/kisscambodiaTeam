Do

6
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,110
you like me?

7
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,710
How can I possibly like you?

8
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,470
I don't even think of you as a woman.

9
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,030
Why are you doing this then?

10
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,070
Don't tell me that to you,

11
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,910
I am the same as Er Gou.

12
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,350
That's right, you are

13
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,190
no different from Er Gou to me.

14
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,950
Why did you come out?

15
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,550
That was scary.

16
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,270
Luckily, I was sharp.

17
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,140
I am like Er Gou to him?

18
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,950
Will Er Gou clean his house, make dinner,

19
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,630
or read his manuscript for him?

20
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,510
What was I thinking?

21
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,070
I actually thought that he liked me.

You are everywhere.

34
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,140
I am everywhere?

35
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,910
You are letting a girl carrying
so many stuff by herself.

36
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,190
Shouldn't you get yourself checked to see

37
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,510
if there is something
wrong with your body?

I mean she is my editor.

48
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,550
So, you do know that she is your editor,

49
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,909

Bai Zhi.

89
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,430
I'd better get going.

90
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,190
Talk to other experienced
writers and learn from them.

91
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,350
Don't mess it up.

92
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,750
Don't worry.

93
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,390
When you return,

94
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,030
I will pick you up at the airport.

95
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,230
Focus on your book.

96
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,390
Let's talk inside, come on.

97
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,390
Let's go.

98
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,430
I heard that Yuan Yue Publishing House
is holding

99
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,470
some kind of
interactive cultural festival.

100
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,750
Isn't that some outdated stuff?

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,710
Exactly.

102
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,470
Gu Bai Zhi is working for Xin Dun Books.

103
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,150
I have a friend who really
wants to get signed to her.

104
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,710
Is your friend man or woman?

105
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,790
Woman.

106
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,150
Woman? It's not going to happen.

107
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,790
Let me tell you, Gu Bai Zhi
only signs male writer,

108
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,430
especially young and handsome man.

109
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,150
No way.

110
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,909
Seriously?

111
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:05,870
Seriously.

112
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,430
You know Yun Fei, right?

113
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,510
She made him famous.

114
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,750
I heard that

115
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,950
they are secretly dating now.

116
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,670
That's why she is working
so hard to make him famous.

117
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,270
Her parachute appointment
in Xin Dun Books,

118
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,590
do you know anything about it?

119
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,030
I do know a little bit about it.

120
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,390
Their company has
a president surnamed Luo.

121
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,510
He admires her.

122
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,870
Why else would she be
able to stay in the company

123
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,710
after she missed out on Zhou Chuan

124
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,380
and Jiang Yu Cheng's new book?

125
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,070
There might be something
going on between them.

126
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

127
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,220
Say it again if you dare.

128
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,070
Who are you?

129
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,230
Who are you?

130
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,860
Do you believe that I can sue you

131
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,470
for defamation and bankrupt you?

132
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,500
I will call the cops now.

133
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,790
I will sue you for
physically threatening me.

134
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,550
Excuse me,

135
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,590
I tripped.

136
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,190
You know,

137
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,190
about Bai Zhi,

138
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,910
I know exactly what kind of person she is.

139
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,190
Parachute appointment?

140
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,910
She has got connections?
Those are nonsense.

141
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,870
I know that it has been tough

142
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,700
for her in the company.

143
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,430
When she signed me

144
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,230
back then,

145
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,510
no one

146
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,590
read my stupid book

147
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,780
I could barely afford food at that time.

148
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,270
Bai Zhi,

149
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,350
she rented a house for me,

150
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,350
she even hired a maid for me.

151
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,270
So that I could focus

152
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,510
and write something out.

153
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,110
So, my new book this time,

154
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,110
it has to be a hit.

155
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,270
She will continue to have a rough time

156
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,780
until I get famous, you know?

157
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,470
Do you know why is she going to

158
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,950
France this time?

159
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,190
She is going to see Maurer.

160
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,510
To sign his new book.

161
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,390
If she fails this time,

162
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,150
she will have to leave Xin Dun Books.

163
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,310
Do you know that?

164
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,110
She never told me.

165
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,750
That's because you don't care about her.

166
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,590
Mr Jiang,

167
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,670
if you don't like her,

168
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,670
convince her to give up.

169
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,550
We have broken up a long time ago.

170
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,350
But she still loves you.

171
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,980
Can you stop getting her hopes up?

172
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,380
I don't want to see
her keep being like this.

173
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,900
Because I really,

174
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,270
really like her.

175
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,710
Don't you have food at your house?

176
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,350
Why did you have to come here to eat?

177
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,870
If Chu Li hadn't invited me here,

178
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,310
I wouldn't have wanted to come too.

179
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,660
It's good to hear that.

180
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,590
The door is right there, go ahead.

181
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,390
He is not going anywhere.

182
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,070
Mr Jiang is my guest.

183
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,830
This is my house.

184
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,100
Yes! This is your house.

185
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,310
And I am just a pet in your house.

186
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,670
I don't deserve to invite
a friend over for breakfast.

187
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,750
I never...

188
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,030
I never said something like that.

189
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,230
You offended her?

190
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,830
Given your intelligence,

191
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,310
you wouldn't have realized it
even if you really offended her.

192
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,390
I really didn't.

193
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,270
Mr Jiang,

194
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,470
thank you for your help for
the Interactive Cultural Festival.

195
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,950
You wrote the openings for me.

196
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,190
You are welcome.

197
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,470
You made all of these?

198
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,230
Yes, I made all of these.

199
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,430
Eat up.

200
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,510
Okay.

201
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,390
This is yours.

202
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,110
I wrote the openings too.

203
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,900
Why do I get only a bowl of peanuts?

204
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,030
Why are you staring at me?

205
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,510
I said nothing wrong.

206
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,190
Why does he get a luxurious breakfast

207
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,620
while I get this

208
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,870
beggar set meal?

209
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,510
Beggar set meal?

210
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,900
A beggar wouldn't be called a beggar,

211
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,030
if he could eat so well.

212
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,710
Mr Jiang, it's too noisy here.

213
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,750
Why don't I take you out to eat?

214
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,350
Sure.

You guys are leaving me behind so that
you don't have to share the food.

to him, I am no different from Er Gou.

I am in a difficult spot right now.

As your friend,

242

I should enlighten you at time like this.

243
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,750
But as a man who is courting you,

244
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,350
if I say something good

245
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,190

246
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,630
doesn't that make me uncommitted?

247
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,660
Mr Jiang, stop teasing me.

248
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,870
Do I look like I'm not serious?

249
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,790
Very much so.

250
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,350
I think

251
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,590
if what Zhou Chuan said

upsets you,

253
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,420
my advice is tell him directly.

Otherwise, a single-celled

255

256
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,470
he had said something wrong.

257
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,980
What he said wasn't exactly wrong.

Morning.

Let me look at the submissions.

273
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,670
Half of the submissions are to

274
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,630

275

It's all thanks to them.

278
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,870
But there were only about 60 submissions.

279
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,550
That's a lot less than

280
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,830
what I thought it would be.

281
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,510
What do you mean by only?

282
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,790
Do you know how many
we received last year?

283
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,790
We received only a total
of 135 submissions last year.

284
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,390
So, based on what you said,

285
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,910
this number is actually a miracle?

286
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,990
Yes.

328

Why do you need my car?

341
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,470
I am going to drive your car

342
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,790
and pick up Chu Li from work tonight.

343
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,270
Don't follow us, can you do that?

344
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,150
No.

345
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,070
Do you want the answer or not?

[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

347
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,270
Mr Jiang, what are you doing here?

348
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,060
Isn't this Mr Zhou Chuan's car?

349
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,990
Yes, I'm going to take you for a spin

350
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,910
and do an experiment.

351
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,430
It's about the ending.

352
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,270
Come on, get in.

353
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,830
How long does it take?

354
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,630
30 minutes.

355
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,990
Mr Jiang, what experiment is this?

356
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,550
There is an escape plot in the ending.

357
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,910
I want to see how long it takes

358
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,710
for the male lead to
escape with his girlfriend

359
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,820
in a high horsepower car

360
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,550
without breaking any traffic rules.

361
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,900
So, what do you think about the result?

362
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,510
It's too slow, it's ten minutes too slow.

363
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,510
In this case, the male lead
is bound to be caught.

364
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,470
It seems I have to
write in a different way.

365
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,460
Such a pity.

366
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,070
You have wasted a lot
of brain cells for nothing.

367
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,180
But I get to take a ride with you,

368
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,590
and we get to

369
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,430
watch the sunset by the river.

370
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,590
It's beautiful.

371
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,390
It's beautiful.

372
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,870
Mr Jiang, why do you keep staring at me?

373
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,030
I just feel

374
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,710
very relaxed when I am with you.

375
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,030
Who do you get nervous around?

376
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,710
Let me take you home.

377
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,220
It's fine, I have to go back to
the office to work overtime.

378
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,300
You are going back to the office to work?

379
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,270
I have kept you for so long,

380
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,910
is there anything I can do to help?

381
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,190
It's fine.

382
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,190
All you need to do is write the ending

383
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,950
and submit without any delays.

384
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,740
Look at the time now,
why isn't she back yet?

385
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,190
Not only did he take away my girl,

386
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,030
he even took my car this time.

387
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,710
What are you barking at?

388
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,950
This is your fault.

389
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,660

Second section of editorial department,

What is the status of
the submissions for the week?

446
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,510
In seven days,

447
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,910
we received a total of 335 submissions.

448
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,270
105 follow-up fan fictions based
on Mr Zhou Chuan's works.

449
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,060

450
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,350

451
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,310
54 for Mr Nian Nian's works.

452
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,310
And Ms Suo Heng

453
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,310
only got 5.

454
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,700
Are you sure you've sorted
through all the replies?

455
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,780
So far, yes.

456
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,230
So few.

457
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,110
Quantity is not good enough,

458
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,230
what about quality?

459
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,910
Basically unusable.

460
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,110
Keep this from the author first.

461
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,750
Miao, you are responsible for Suo Heng.

462
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,150
Is there anything you can do?

463
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,190
What solution can I come up with?

464
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,310
I have tried everything I can.

465
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,110
Is that so?

466
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,830
What have you tried? Tell me.

467
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,030
When she didn't write well, I got
someone to pick up where she left off.

468
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,510
But her openings are too intricate.

469
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,470
No one can pick it up.

470
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,870
You chose this piece yourself, didn't you?

471
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,190
How come you didn't
realize this issue before?

472
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,700
What do you think?

473
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,070
That's because her other articles

474
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,590
are not as good as this one.

475
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,630
That can't be.

476
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,710
I have read Ms Suo Heng's other articles,

477
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,830
they are much better to pick up than this.

478
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,070
That's your own opinion.

479
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,430
Have you read more articles

480
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,430
than I have?

481
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,350
Chief Editor Yu,

482
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,710
can we use another article
written by Ms Suo Heng?

483
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,630
Sure.

484
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,070
Didn't we hold this event for Suo Heng?

485
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,110
Because Suo Heng can't write well,

486
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,900
we had to get someone to write for her.

487
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,590
When no one is capable
of writing for her,

488
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,420
we just change to another article.

489
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,500
Right, looks like
Yuan Yue Publishing House

490
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,260
is opening only for Suo Heng.

491
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,630
Are we giving up on
the author just like this?

492
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,150
So what else can we do
if we don't give up on her?

493
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,030
Can she bring any value to

494
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,590
Yuan Yue Publishing House now?

495
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,030
That's enough.

496
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,870
The quality and quantity of submissions

497
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,230
are not up to standard,

498
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,510
it's not only the author's problem,

499
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,910
we editors are also responsible.

500
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,870
Miao, I don't care if
the selection of this article

501
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,030
was a mistake,

502
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,580
but we are having a problem now,

503
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,150
and you have to take care of it.

504
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,270
Please keep in mind that

505
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,550
authors and editors are tied together.

506
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,430
You rise or fall together.

507
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,790
Find a few tight-lipped authors

508
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,190
to help write the follow-up.

509
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,270
We can't afford to have any problem.

510
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,470
Meeting adjourned.

511
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,630
Chu Li,

512
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,070
since you care about Suo Heng so much,

513
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,510
why don't you get
someone to write for her?

514
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,870
Fine, I will do it.

516
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,870
Mr Cao,

517
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,470
for this year's
Interactive Culture Festival,

518
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,470
I'd like your help in writing a follow-up

519
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,190
for a science fiction's openings.

520
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,310
You are the best at science fiction.

521
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,470
Yes.

522
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,030
But you only have three days.

523
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,630
Thank you for your help.

524
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,190
Okay, okay.

525
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,310
Bye, bye.

526
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,950
Mum, Dad and I are here
to pick you up from work.

527
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,220
I am here.

528
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,710
Qiu Qiu, thank you for you and
Dad to come pick me up.

529
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,950
I didn't drive here today.

530
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,990
I was just thinking about

531
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,270
hailing a cab home.

532
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,230
I knew you would get off late from work.

533
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,590
By the way, my mom's
birthday is coming soon.

534
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,510
I want to gather the family

535
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,550
to have a meal together by then.

536
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,740
Don't forget it.

537
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,430
I won't forget her birthday.

538
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,790
I have got her gift.

539
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,510
Mum, let me tell you a secret,

540
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,870
I have prepared a gift for Grandma too.

541
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,180
Really? You have really grown up, Qiu Qiu.

542
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,070
The results of
the submissions came out today.

543
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,750
Mr Zhou, would you like to guess

544
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,310
how many submissions have you got?

545
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,790
No, it's predicable.

546
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,030
105 submissions in total.

547
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,350
105?

548
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,870
Is that many?

549
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,870
Yuan Yue Publishing House
is out of date indeed.

550
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,940
Don't you dare insult
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

551
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,110
How many have Jiang Yu Cheng received?

552
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,310
Less than me?

553
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,100
So,

554
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,470
what exactly is
the ranking of submissions?

555
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,030
Did Jiang Yu Cheng receive
much lesser submissions than me?

556
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,950
Only the author can know

557
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,310
the number of submissions for his article.

558
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,910
Other people is not allowed to know.

559
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,950
I am other people?

560
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,390
Especially certain people
with bad intentions.

561
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,830
Now I am other people.

562
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,780
Who begged to be
my managing editor back then?

563
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,420
We are all on the same team.

564
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,110
Don't you forget that

565
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,550
even though I am managing editor
of Book of Luo He God,

566
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,580
but I am also the managing editor of

567
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,190
Mr Jiang's
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

568
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,110
So,

569
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,150
how many submissions does
Jiang Yu Cheng actually receive?

570
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,070
If you sign your new novel

571
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,910
to Yuan Yue Publishing House,

572
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,910
I can consider that I will
only have eyes for you

573
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,750
in future.

574
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,750
Very tactical, you.

575
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,630
Tell me then.

576
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,630
Are there authors who receive submissions

577
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,430
so little that that can be
counted on one hand?

578
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,150
Mr Zhou, since you care
so much about your peers,

579
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,590
will you consider writing a follow-up

580
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,590
for author who receive
poor quality submissions?

581
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,790
Who is it?

582
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,790
Just tell me will you do it or not?

583
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,510
There is no way I would
be a ghostwriter for others.

584
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,510
Move, move, get out of my way.

585
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,670
You think I can't find out
about it if you don't tell me?

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,150
You are coming back?

Did you stay up all night

640
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,510
because you were worrying
about Suo Heng's submission?

641
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,270
Not only this.

642
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,150
Also, it's that friend of mine.

643
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,070
She saw the guy talking with

644
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,310
another woman on the phone,

645
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,220
they were talking and laughing.

646
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,230
Somehow,

647
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,990
she felt upset.

648
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,830
It's obvious that

649
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,790
that friend of yours was jealous.

650
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,510
Chu Li,

651
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,390
is that guy a playboy?

652
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,380
Calling him a playboy is
a flattering term for him.

653
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,510
Except for

654
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,510
my friend,

655
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,110
no one can stand him at all.

656
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,350
Mr Fox finished it so soon.

657
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,230
I thought Mr Fox would get rusty
in writing since he hadn't written

658
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,110
anything over the past years.

659
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,180
I didn't expect that he still got it.

660
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,430
Let me see, let me see.

661
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,110
How good can it be that

662
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,590
it impressed you so much?

663
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,430
Mr Zhou Chuan wrote this, isn't it?

664
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,340
The writer has such a wild imagination.

665
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,630

666
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,750
his wonderful storytelling skill

667
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,350
has completely surpassed

668
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,430
the openings written by Suo Heng.

669
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,870
This was not written by Zhou Chuan.

670
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,830
It's my friend.

671
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,190
Their styles are so similar.

672
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,270
It is obviously the same person.

673
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,110
Forget it, I am sending it
to Chief Editor Yu now.

674
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,030
I am sure of it.

675
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,270
Chu Li.

676
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,710
I read the draft.

677
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,830
It's nice.

678
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,430
The writing style is
sophisticated and neat.

679
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,110
The plots are brilliant.

680
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,510
Who wrote it?

681
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,350
Why do I feel that
his writing style is a bit similar

682
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,990
to Mr Zhou Chuan?

683
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,790
No, no, this wasn't written by Zhou Chuan.

684
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,180
It's my friend.

685
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,350
But he has mimicked
Zhou Chuan's writing style before.

686
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,990
He is known as Junior Zhou Chuan.

687
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,350
He has stopped writing for many years,

688
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,190
I am surprised that he is
still as good as ever.

689
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,860
He has saved the day for Suo Heng.

690
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
Thank him for me.

691
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,470
You can ask him to
write some short articles.

692
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,270
Really?

693
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,790
You really think he can write?

694
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,130
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

695
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,150
[Interested to write articles for us?
The money is good.]

696
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,830
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

697
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,030
Be honest with me,

698
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,070
was it written by Mr Zhou Chuan?

699
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,990
It really was not.

700
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,140
I swear that if I lie,

701
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,350
I would gain 20 pounds.

702
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,230
I asked him before,
he denied it immediately.

703
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,310
This is so strange.

704
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,150
What is so strange about it?

705
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,230
There are many authors
who write in the same style.

706
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,660
No, Chu Li.

707
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,910
I have been keeping watch on Mr Zhou Chuan

708
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,390
since he published his first book.

709
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,830
Every one of his books,

710
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,790
I have read them

711
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,030
more than ten times from beginning to end.

712
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,990
I noticed that Mr Zhou Chuan

713
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,430
has a special habit in writing books.

714
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,910
Between the paragraphs
of significant plot like this,

715
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,550
he always uses five ellipses.

716
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,030
At the end of his work,

717
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,030
he also uses five ellipses

718
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,950
and writes an End.

719
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,230
See.

720
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,350
This book is the same.

721
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,760
[End]

722
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,750
See this.

723
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,910
And look at that again.

724
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,950
[End]

725
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,350
It's the same, isn't it?

726
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,790
How's that possible? You must
have been watching too many dramas.

727
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,830
One, two, three, four, five.

728
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,190
After Zhou Chuan became famous,

729
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,630
Mr Fox started to stop writing.

730
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,110
Oh my god.

731
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,190
No way.

732
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,150
What should I do?

733
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,310
If Mr Zhou Chuan really is Mr Fox,

734
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,750
I have been mocking him every day

735
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,870
and calling him a Drama King.

736
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,300
That doesn't make sense.

737
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,350
If Mr Zhou Chuan

738
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,070
really is Mr Fox,

739
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,310
he would have killed me already
under these circumstances.

740
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,990
How could he be possibly
letting me freeloading off of him

741
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,630
and live in his house for free?

742
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,390
No.

743
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,990
It's not like that.

744
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,350
If Mr Zhou Chuan isn't Mr Fox,

745
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,150
we are not that close for him to

746
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,270
sacrifice his millions dollars worth
of house to let me live for free.

747
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,470
But I...

748
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,750
I clean his house,

749
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,630
make dinners and walk the dog for him.

750
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,670
But he can get anyone to do that for him.

751
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,070
No, no.

752
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,340
I have to ask him for answer.

753
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,750
If Mr Zhou Chuan

754
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,780
and Mr Fox are the same person,

755
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,030
then haven't I been fooling
by the same person

756
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,550
with two accounts?

757
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,870
No.

758
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,750
I will send him a message and bluff him.

759

763
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,950
She managed to twist
her ankle while walking.

764
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,510
I am impressed.

765
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,510
Mr Zhou Chuan!

766
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,870
Your ankle...

767
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,220
What's wrong with my ankle?

768
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,070

Your shoes are dirty,

773
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,710
you should wash it.

[I didn't get busted, did I?]

775
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,830
Good for you.

776
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,230
You have been coming
home late every night.

777
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,910
You didn't even walk Er Gou.

778
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,460
I let you live here for free.

779
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,030
Did Yu Yao pay you for working overtime?

780
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,190
Can't you tell which side

781
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,790
is more important?

782
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,990
Such a fool.

783
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,070
Yes, yes, yes.

784
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,550
I don't know what's good
for me, and I am a fool.

785
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,350
After all, when you advised me
not to join the publishing industry,

786
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,150
that I should first stay alive
before I go after my dreams,

787
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,540
I didn't listen to you.

788
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,070
That's right. When did
you ever listen to me?

789
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,470
[Oh no, that's what Mr Fox said to her.]
