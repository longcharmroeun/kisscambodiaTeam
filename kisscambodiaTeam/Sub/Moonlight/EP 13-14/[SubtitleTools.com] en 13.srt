17

It won't do.

18
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,670
I'll try it again.

19
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,310
Hello.

20
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,070
Right,

21
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,550
my work is a trash and it's not
qualified for the selection.

22
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,550
Only the work of an old author like you

23
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,540
is qualified.

24
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,870
But

25
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,060
which book of yours is awarded

26
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,110
after winning Hong Ying Award?

27
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,510
I guess the old author like you

28
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,310
has been drained,

29
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,350
that's why they want

30
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,350
the young authors
like us to be the fillers.

31
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,110
Forget it.

32
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,030
I never thought

33
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,630
you were my father.

34
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,590
I won't be surprised

35
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,310
if you tell me

36
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,150
that I was adopted.

37
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,590
I wonder why

38
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,070
a person who never calls me

39
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,710
gave me a call all of a sudden.

40
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,070
So, it was Mr Xia told you that.

41
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,390
Are you afraid that
I'll embarrass the Zhou family

42
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,310
if my work is sent to
the selection of Huazhi Award?

43
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,420
Oh my god, Mr Zhou senior!

44
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,829
You're getting me

45
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,910
in trouble.

46
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,910
All right.

47
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,230
I know what to do then.

48
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,030
Gentleman, this is a toast to you.

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,550
Are you sleep walking?

50
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,670
I will only dare to flatter my mother

51
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,900
and secretly complain about her.

52
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,710
I really respect the one who dares to

53
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,430
fight face-to-face like you.

54
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,830
You should be ashamed

55
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,230
of eavesdropping.

56
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,870
Mr Zhou Chuan.

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,350
Don't waste your chance

58
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,350
because of your father.

59
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,150
I think you worry that
I might hold up on you.

60
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,310
Promise me to send your work to

61
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,269
Huazhi Award's selection for my sake.

62
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,830
Book of Luo He God
managed to sell well.

63
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,430
The honour and bonus

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,950
are all given
to the circulation department.

65
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,510
Miao and Liang Chong Lang

66
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,510
even grossed me out
with the figure 349,000.

67
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,470
I've been depressed

68
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,710
for a whole day by this matter.

69
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,140
As for Ah Xiang,

70
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,550
she has been editing the poster.

71
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,100
This deepens

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,420
her myopia.

73
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,790
And for Mr Xia,

74
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,350
he has a weak body,

75
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,350
but still insists to supervise
the progress of the project.

76
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,750
It breaks my heart
whenever I think about it.

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,550
Use your words.

78
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,550
Why are you crying?

79
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,990
I don't know why.

80
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,830
But I always want to cry lately.

81
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,900
Stop crying.

82
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,470
Probably because I think it's unfair.

83
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,550
Why does all the credit
go to the circulation department?

84
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,590
But there's nothing

85
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,230
for our editorial department.

86
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,350
I've seen your effort.

87
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,990
Just that I didn't get
a chance to say thank you.

88
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,310
I'm glad that

89
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,750
I'd signed Book of Luo He God
over to you.

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,990
Thank you.

91
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,350
Mr Zhou Chuan,

92
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,580
so you've seen my effort.

93
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,510
All right, don't cry.

94
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,830
Why do you cry over anything?

95
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,270
Aren't you usually

96
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,790
a domineering person?

97
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,830
Why are you crying so much recently?

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,590
Can I ask you a question?

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,270
Go ahead.

100
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,150
Can you send Book of Luo He God

101
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,190
to Huazhi Award's selection?

102
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,590
Okay.

103
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,390
I'll do as you wish.

104
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,630
I think you deserve

105
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,470
the most credit anyway.

106
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,470
I'll let you call the shots.

107
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,670
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

108
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,470
Don't mention it. Don't cry.

109
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,870
Cheers!

110
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,710
We didn't get a chance to celebrate

111
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,390
the great sale of
Book of Luo He God.

112
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,710
Congratulations on
becoming the top author!

113
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,430
Slow down!

114
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,830
Why are you more excited than me?

115
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,230
Because I'm happy.

116
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,620
Since your bonus is gone,

117
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,990
then just stay in my house.

118
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,190
Do you have only one bedding set?

119
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,710
Go and acquire one more set.

120
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,980
Are you going to pay for it?

121
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,430
You've just cried in my arms

122
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,830
this afternoon.

123
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,750
And now

124
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,430
you started to swindle me, right?

125
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,990
Of course.

126
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,030
Money is the most important thing.

127
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,870
The royalty on
Book of Luo He God that I got

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,150
is enough for you to
buy ten mattresses.

129
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,190
No, besides the mattress,

130
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,950
there're a lot of stuffs I want to buy.

131
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,030
For example, my new clothes,

132
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,380
new pillow,

133
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,510
and also a beanbag.

134
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,070
Then I just buy you a new house.

135
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,180
All right, stop drinking.

136
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,990
You're not allowed to

137
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,820
go out drinking as
you're a bad drinker.

138
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,230
I refuse.

139
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,510
You're not my boyfriend.

140
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,550
Why are you telling me what to do?

141
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,190
I tell you what. I'm a good drinker.

142
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,670
Give it back to me!

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,870
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

Last night?

164
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,110
Nothing happened last night, right?

165
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,470
Probably...

166
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,430
Nothing happened, right?

167
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,270
Rest assured.

168
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,030

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,950
Then... I shall go to work first.

171
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh my god!

172
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,750
What should I do?

173
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,190
Did something really happen?

174
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,430
He wants to be responsible for me?

175
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,550
What is that about?

176
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,870
What am I going
to explain to my father?

177
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,700
Chu Li, what's the matter?

178
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,190
You look awful.

179
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,550
Last night...

180
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,870
What happened last night?

181
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,260
Last night,

182
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,710
there's a friend of mine
and she was drunk.

183
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,710
Then?

184
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,350
Then an indescribable matter seemed to

185
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,750
have happened between her and a man.

186
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,270
Then?

187
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,990
Then I...

188
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,700
My friend doesn't know what to do.

189
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,780
Then does your friend

190
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,310
like the guy?

191
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,550
She seems

192
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,230
kind of

193
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,540
likes that guy.

194
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,350
Just ask your friend

195
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,790
try dating the guy.

196
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,070
It's not right.

197
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,030
That guy's best friend is pursuing her.

198
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,590
It's confusing.

199
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,070
Then who exactly

200
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,110
does your friend like?

201
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,190
Of course she likes...

202
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,910
Why didn't you answer
Mr Zhou Chuan's call?

203
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,670
Did she just hang up on me?

204
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
[When are you coming back?]

205
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,310
[I want to have hotpot tonight.]

206
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,550
[Zhou Chuan]

207
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,070
Hello.

208
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,430
The books are here?

209
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,790
All right, I'm coming.

210
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,950
Meeting in the conference room.

211
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,510
Let's go to the meeting.

212
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,430
Hurry up! Let's go to the meeting.

213
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,390
It doesn't feel right.

214
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,910
Who's her friend?

215
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,550
Isn't that me?

216
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,870
Yuan Yue's annual
Interactive Cultural Festival

217
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,270
between authors and readers
is coming soon.

218
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,790
Story relay event is held every year

219
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,670
to increase the interaction between

220
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,950
the journal and
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

221
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,470
Contact each author you handle.

222
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,430
Understood.

223
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,220
Chu Li,

224
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,350
have you heard me?

225
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,910
Yes, I heard you.

226
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,790
That's perfect. I have something to add.

227
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,710
What did she say?

228
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,110
Mr Liang suggests that

229
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,470
we can examine

230
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,230
the popularity of our authors

231
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,150
with this Interactive Culture Festival.

232
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,110
For those who have less popularity,

233
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,430
we will

234
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,540
cancel their serial stories

235
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,790
in Moonlight Magazine.

236
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,590
Do you mean

237
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,630
terminating the contract
with those authors?

238
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,190
Right, it's the survival
of the fittest.

239
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,750
It's very normal.

240
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,870
I think Mr Liang's suggestion

241
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,470
is reasonable.

242
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,990
I agree.

243
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,190
Did Director Yang agree with it?

244
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,580
Director Yang said

245
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,750
Yuan Yue is not a charitable institution.

246
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,910
In this Interactive Culture Festival,

247
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,070
please be sure to do
your best for each author

248
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,670
so that they could
perform at their best.

249
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,510
In this way, the editorial department
can have a clear conscience.

250
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,590
Chu Li, you have Zhou Chuan

251
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,790
and Jiang Yu Cheng these two geniuses.

252
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,470
What are you worried about?

253
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,990
I'm not worried about that.

254
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,430
They can't take advantage
of others like this.

255
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,580
They keep asking them to

256
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,150
write manuscripts without paying them.

257
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,630
How can they do that?

258
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,020
Listen to me.

259
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,550
You don't have to write 6,000 words.

260
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,430
Just 3,000 words are enough.

261
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,830
It's just the new pattern once a year.

262
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,940
Then I'll wait for
your starting article.

263
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,580
It's a deal, goodbye.

264
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,310
I forgot to tell Suo Heng

265
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,580
that she doesn't have
to write many versions.

266
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,630
I can't read that much.

267
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,430
Miao doesn't worry about
how the writing's going.

268
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,900
He doesn't care

269
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,510
if those unpopular authors get fired.

270
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,560
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour: When are you
coming back? I want to have hotpot tonight.]

271
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,430
[When are you coming back?]

272
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,190
[I want to have hotpot tonight.]

273
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,110
Why does he act

274
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,230
like nothing happened?

275
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,580
This is awkward.

276
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,870
This Stinky Monkey is indeed disloyal.

277
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,030
She already sneaked out to date

278
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,470
after only a few hours.

279
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,030
For this year's
Interactive Culture Festival,

280
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,980
my company asks every editor

281
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,390
to find our author to
create a story relay.

282
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,470
Mr Jiang, I'm begging you.

283
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,710
Okay, when do you need it?

284
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,030
Really?

285
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,070
Preferably within this week.

286
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,510
Mr Jiang, I'll never
forget your kindness.

287
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,070
I will never turn down your request.

288
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,790
But why didn't you ask Zhou Chuan?

289
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,310
Such activity without pay,

290
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,110
he will say that I'm insulting him

291
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,630
if I ask him to do it.

292
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,750
It's better for me not
to ask for trouble.

293
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,230
What is the activity?

294
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,710
But he'll know it

295
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,430
sooner or later.

296
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,070
And again he'll think that

297
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,910
you don't think much of him
if he finds out about this.

298
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,020
It's all right.

299
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,070
I already got used to it anyway.

300
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,349
You don't seem fine today.

301
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,630
Why are you avoiding whenever

302
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,829
we talk about Zhou Chuan?

303
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,869
Did something happen
between you two?

304
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,099
Am I? I'm not avoiding.

305
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,420
Nothing happened between us.

306
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,470
Are you sure?

307
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,710
Yes, I'm sure.

308
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,670
What can happen between us?

309
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,140
Nothing happened.

310
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,910
Mr Jiang,

311
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,670
I'll leave first as I got work to do.

312
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,750
Come out, she didn't say anything.

313
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,830
How did you know I was here?

314
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,790
Look at your size,

315
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,580
you're like a groundhog,
sneaking around.

316
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,310
Do you think I'm blind?

317
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,190
I think you are.

318
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,660
This is so-called
James Bond's hiding skills.

319
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,750
Do you know that?

320
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,740
A cup of coffee, please.

321
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,150
I think you're more
like James the groundhog.

322
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,580
I wonder

323
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,950
what happened between you and Chu Li.

324
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,950
Normally, you'd have rushed in

325
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,350
if you saw us talking.

326
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,110
But today you were hiding instead.

327
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,750
Who's hiding?

328
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,110
I was standing there

329
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,510
to rest for a while.

330
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,430
Did you two

331
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,830
have a fight?

332
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,230
That's great!

333
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,150
What do you mean great?
Where are the books?

334
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,070
Thank you.

335
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,990
What exactly is the story of

336
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,430
Huang Quan Inn you wrote?

337
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,350
Why do you need many
ancient architecture books?

463
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,630
So, what my suggestion for you is

464
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,590
that I hope that you could

465
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,430

But I'm bad at writing
in science fiction.

469

It's not that hard, look.

470
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,790
You just have to watch a few movies.

471
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,510
And then read more
science fiction novels.

472
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,070

473

I think you're good at
writing in this genre now.

475
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,870
Actually, it was quite hard for me
to write in that genre.

476

of being a bad player.

that you're good at?

[Golden Spears and Armoured Horses]

508
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,110
Golden Spears and Armoured Horses.

509
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,310
If you like histories,

510
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,550
this is a nice book.

511
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,630
This author is pretty cool.

512
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,630
This book is quite nice.

513
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,470
But the subsequent book is not
as good as the previous one.

514
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,350
The debut work got
the author to the peak.

515
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,310
But there's no news of the author now.

516
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,910
How is it? Do you like it?

517
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,950
I'm selling it for two dollars.

518
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,310
No, thank you.

519
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,910
Don't go.

520
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,430
I sell it for 50 cents.

521
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,270
There're many other books, pick some!

522
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,550
You're not going to work
overtime this weekend, right?

523
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,630
Let's go and buy two beanbags.

524
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,030
What's wrong? Who made you angry?

525
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,550
Don't start it.

526
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,790
Today, Miao asked one of his authors

527
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,740
to write in the genre
which she is bad at.

528
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,950
What does that have to do with you?

529
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,070
That author is Suo Heng.

530
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,990
I've read her Golden Spears
and Armoured Horses.

531
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,070
She is suitable in
writing historical novel.

532
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,300
Asking her to write science fiction,

533
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,060
isn't that ruining her career?

534
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,380
Then

535
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,910
did she agree?

536
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,470
It looked like she didn't reject him.

537
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,470
She asked for it.

538
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,350
If you have the time to feel aggrieved,

539
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,350
you might as well prepare the dinner.

540
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,470
Do you have compassion?

541
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,070
She chose to compromise.

542
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,230
Do I still have to show my compassion?

543
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,150
There're many authors
like her in this world.

544
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,630
You can find them everywhere.

545
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,140
Do you think every author could

546
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,510
write the stories they like?

547
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,780
To earn a living,

548
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,510
they will give up on
what they insisted.

549
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,030
For this kind of author,

550
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,310
I advise you to mind your own business.

551
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,390
Ms Suo Heng, is your hand all right?

552
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,070
I'm fine. It comes from years of writing.

553
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,790
Let me help you.

554
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,430
Thank you.

555
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,550
Wait a little longer,

556
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,310
Miao will be here soon.

557
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,350
I have to go.

558
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,300
Here, did you write it?
Let me take a look.

559
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,550
You're done for now. Get out.

560
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,980
Deputy Editor Miao,

561
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,230
I was cramming last night.

562
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,380
I watched dozens
science fiction movies.

563
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,990
And I wrote three
introductions in total.

564
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,270
I'm more confident

565
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,830
about the first one.

566
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,710
About the third introduction,

567
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,270
I personally think that

568
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,030
there's some problem on the setting,
it's not clear enough.

569
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,710
In these few introductions of yours,

570
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,030
I think

571
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,270
the third one is the best.

572
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,670
The third one?

573
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,110
The third one.

574
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,700
This one, look.

575
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,870
In these three introductions of yours,

576
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,100
as for the first one,

577
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,590
it is a historical plot
which is cloaked in science fiction.

578
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,430
You're skilled at writing

579
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,630
in historical theme, it is common.

580
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,190
The readers are used to it.

581
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,230
As for the second one,
it's just a historical theme.

582
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,750
This is already outdated.

583
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,590
The young readers

584
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,230
are not interested in this.

585
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,110
As for the third one...

586
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,310
Look, it's really eye-catching.

587
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,470
Look at this.

588
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,550
The Eighth Universe...

589
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,740
This... This... This...

590
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,350
The Husky Planet...

591
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,390
The story about the fallen
of the youngest great man...

592
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,310
It's

593
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,390
the Watt Empire of the Husgy Planet.

594
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,550
Is it Husgy?

595
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,950
Look, I've mistaken.

596
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,710
Right, it's the Husgy Planet.

597
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,510
The youngest great man
in the Watt Empire

598
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,590
is going to fall.

599
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,390
Look at this introduction,

600
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,270
it caught my eyes.

601
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,310
But I think the third introduction

602
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,390
is too fanciful.

603
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,710
There's a few conversion
rules of the universe

604
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,670
that I haven't set clear.

605
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,670
Didn't I tell you that?

606
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,870
You don't have to think about it.

607
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,390
Let the readers think.

608
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,310
But I'm afraid the readers
can't understand.

609
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,750
It's not possible.

610
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,230
Right.

611
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,950
It's alright that they can't understand.

612
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,390
Just think this way.

613
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,950
The more odd it is,

614
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,910
the more serious they will read it.

615
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,550
There're many young readers,
they will think

616
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,230
that only they can understand it.

617
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,180
It's good.

This...

620
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,030
I'll take this and

621
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,190
proofread it right away.

622
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,390
This...

623
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,150

hand in the manuscript.

626
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,550
This time, there's no exception too.

627
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,190
Good, you deserve the encouragement.
Keep going.

628

This is for you.

If you haven't consulted doctor,

you can go to the hospital
to have a check-up.

633
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,910
You can only keep writing

00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,540
Thank you, Chu Li.

636
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,390
Then I'll off to work first.

Never mind.

I think your hand's condition
is quite bad.

643
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,469
Maybe you should see a doctor

after submitting the manuscripts.

645
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,389

in the following month.

674
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,620
Rest assured, Chief Editor Yu.

675
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,790
Chu Li,

676
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,390
you're here.

677
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,830
Chief Editor Yu is asking
for your typography.

678
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,110
This introduction of Ms Suo Heng

679
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,220
is much worse than
the previous version I read.

680
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,110
Ms Suo Heng usually
will write several introductions

681
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,700
for Miao to choose.

682
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,790
This must be chosen by Miao.

683
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,150
It started with a large framework of

684
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,030
science fiction in the current version.

685
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,510
The begin of a war,

686
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,190
the federal and empire,
the fallen of the youngest great man.

687
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,350
It's too complicated.

688
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,310
Perhaps man

689
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,430
likes this concept more.

690
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,230
Other authors are trying to make

691
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,990
the introduction as simple as they could.

692
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,140
What Nian Nian writes
is a sweet article.

693
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,550
The dog of the male lead passed away.

694
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,310
and come back as a human to repay him.

so that the readers from
various levels can continue writing it.

698
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,430
Only Ms Suo Heng
takes the opposite track.

699
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,710
I don't understand why

700
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,660
Miao asked her to write
this kind of introduction.

701
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,390
I have no idea too.

702
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,630
Perhaps Miao wants to give up on her.

703
