00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,070
Chu Li, what happened to your leg?

5
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,830
It's fine. I just fell down.

6
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,070
Why are you so happy
even though you fell down?

7
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,470
Am I?

8
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,270
Yes.

9
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,229
Look in the mirror
if you don't believe me.

10
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,550
Your face is all red.

11
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,110
And you can't stop smiling.

12
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,830
I'm happy.

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,220
Enough. Let's go in.

14
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,270
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

Are these my books?

17
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,390
I've been imagining this

18
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,550
for so long.

19
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,060
Finally, I can see them for myself.

20

I know.

00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm too excited because
this is my first time seeing them.

By the way,

27

was that the 4-Colour Heidelberg?

33
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,230
I thought you hate him.

34
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,390
Yes. I hate him.

35
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,190
You don't look like you hate him.

36
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,590
You'll develop affection
for him eventually.

37

The person I hate

38
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,829
is him in real life.

39
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,270

about you visiting the printing house
to do the colour match?

about what they want

affectionately tagged Mr Zhou Chuan.

63

It's just part of my job.

64
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,950
Besides, it's not that affectionate.

65
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,310
That's not up to you to decide.

66
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,710
Look at the comments on Weibo.

67
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,310
Cocoon has told the public that

68
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,820
you don't allow

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,460
the illustrator and the author
to communicate with each other

70
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,470
and are using the power that
you don't have to bully the illustrator.

71
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,300
And when you are updating them
with the progress,

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,500
you always try to flaunt

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,260
how intimate you are with the author

74
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,030
and think of him as
your personal property.

75
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,270
Madam Cocoon is affecting
Mr Zhou Chuan's work.

76
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,550
It's my duty to prevent her from

77
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,350
harassing Mr Zhou Chuan.

78
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,510
As for the other accusations,

79
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,910
they are simply not true.

80
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,230
They are nonsense.

81
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,990
Simply not true?

82
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,300
Simply not true?

83

85
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,790
when he was stung by his conscience.

86
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,710
I don't care if you are out

87
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,710
to release stress

88
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,510
or release sexual tension.

89
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,340
But in this critical moment,

90
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,870
nothing can go wrong,

91
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,270
understand?

92
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,310
Look.

93
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,110
Zhou Chuan and Jiang Yu Cheng

94
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,030
are considered as

95
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,750
handsome male authors, right?

96
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,510
A lot of female readers

97
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,030
are not reasonable.

98
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,790
You can't talk sense into them.

99
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,909
They'll think of themselves
as the author's

100
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:05,990
mother,

101
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,100
wife

102
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,150
or even auntie,

103
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,510
right?

104
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,500
If you are too close with the author,

105
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,350
you'll become their imaginary enemy.

106
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,670
Don't worry.

107
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,220
My relationship with both of them

108
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,350
is totally innocent.

109
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,030
Yes.

110
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,620
I totally

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,350
believe that you are innocent.

112
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,310
But the thing is, those readers

113
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,550
have to believe it,

114
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,660
right?

115
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,660
So, I called you here today

116
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,910
to give you a reminder.

117
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,230
No matter what they say online,

118
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,070
do not

119
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,750
talk back to them.

120
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,950
Okay.

121
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,310
What do you want to drink?

122
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,310
I'll buy it from the convenience store.

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,340
My treat.

124
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,220
By the way,

125
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,750
did anything happen today?

126
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,590
No.

127
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,710
Just some evil fans

128
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,870
and that unprofessional Cocoon.

129
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,390
But I'm not affected by them at all.

130
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,470
The drama that they've started

131
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,150
has become a promotion for the books.

132
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,180
As long as the books can sell,

133
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,230
I don't mind.

134
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,150
By the way,

135
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,220
do you have any idea

136
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,830
on what exclusive gifts to give

137
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,790
for our advanced sale this time?

138
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,910
I thought you'll threaten me to sign

139
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,380
every single book that we sell.

140
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,510
Of course not.

141
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,780
Too many signatures
will decrease its value.

142
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,390
I'm glad you know not to

143
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,630
kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

144
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,670
Actually, I know that

145
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,190
our fans want an extra volume.

146
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,590
But if we have an official extra volume,

147
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,220
those booksellers will not agree.

148
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,030
What do you think about
main characters' journals?

149
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,630
It's like a summary of

150
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,780
those important events from your novel.

151
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,230
Main characters' journal.

152
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,060
Sounds good.

153
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,390
But let me tell you.

154
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,070
Don't make it too long.

155
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,190
It's going to be

156
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,430
a thin little booklet.

157
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,430
Always remember that

158
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,380
your words are money.

159
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,070
Don't try so hard.

160
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,470
Are you saying that I'm too wordy?

161
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,390
I wouldn't dare.

162
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,470
If those keyboard warriors

163
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,390
knew how you treat me,

164
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,910
they wouldn't have misunderstood.

165
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,110
What?

166
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,310
That Madam Cocoon replied to the readers

167
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,430
insinuating that I am uneducated.

168
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,790
She's the uneducated one.

169
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,670
Don't be mad.

170
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,950
You'll have to buy a new phone
if you break yours.

171
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,950
Who is Fairy Li that
screenshot this for you?

172
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,070

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,790
Great!

340
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,620
Great.

341
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,430
We have less than

342
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,910
24 hours before the pre-sale starts.

343
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,070
Make sure that you are ready for battle.

344
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,390
Do your best!

345
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,020
Do your best!

346
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,950
Do our best.

347
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,630
Move!

348
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,780
[I want Mr Zhou Chuan's signature!]
[Mr Zhou Chuan has another new book.]

349
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,280
[I want Mr Zhou Chuan's signature.]

350
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,110
Chu Li.

351
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,110
The sale of the Book of Luo He God
is going great.

352
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,030
You might be getting a bonus next year.

353
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,390
Really?

354
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,540
Am I finally going to become rich?

355
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,350
Look at you.

356
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,390
How long is your house contract?

357
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,470
Maybe

358
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,630
you can rent a bigger house next year.

359
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,390
Ah Xiang.

360
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,220
Ah Xiang.

361
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,030
Have you ever realised that

362
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,740
when you open your door,

363
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,590
you'll be lonely and upset

364
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,790
when your house is in total darkness?

365
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,030
No.

366
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,390
Imagine this.

367
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,830
When you open the door one day,

368
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,550
a very cute dog

369
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,350
will run enthusiastically towards you

370
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,310
and a person will drowsily
say this to you.

371
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,590
Why are you so late?

372
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,270
I'm famished.

373
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,940
You are talking about marriage?

374
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,589
But at this age,

375
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,470
I'm not planning on getting married yet.

376
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,230
I'm not talking about marriage.

377
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,109
I'm talking about renting a house.

378
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,069
Weren't you talking about

379
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,430
husband and a dog just now?

380
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,109
I just suddenly realised that from now on,

381
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,470
I don't think I'll be able to live alone.

382
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,630
Did you fell in love with your landlord?

383
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,670
I don't think so.

384
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,710
No?

385
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,380
Why did you sound so unsure?

386
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,780
Chu Li.

387
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,710
How can you like a man

388
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,110
who just lies there and

389
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,870
orders you to cook for him?

390
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,750
We are quite pretty.

391
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,340
When we choose a man,

392
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,190
we have to choose a good man.

393
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,300
You can't simply choose someone.

394
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,470
Nonsense.

395
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,670
I don't

396
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,990
like him.

397
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,700
My feeling for him

398
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,150
is just simply an admiration.

399
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,830
It's not love.

400
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,340
Your antagonist this time is not bad.

401
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,470
But the protagonist is too weak.

402
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,060
Are you listening to me?

403
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,580
I'm listening to your every word.

404
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,070
Go back and amend it then.

405
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,350
Hello?

406
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,710
Okay. I'll go there now.

407
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,910
Sister, what's wrong?

408
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,150
How is Ms Liu now?

409
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,220
She passed out.

410
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,390
The doctor said that

411
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,230
this has happened many times already.

412
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,990
I didn't even know.

413
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,870
It's quite serious this time.

414
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,030
Don't worry.

415
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,910
She'll be fine.

416
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,270
When I was young,

417
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,710
I waited outside like this

418
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,350
when my parents passed away.

419
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,910
All these years, Ms Liu is like my mother.

420
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,070
What if she doesn't

421
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,270
wake up?

422
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,550
Don't think too much.

423
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,430
The result is not out yet.

424
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,550
Sit down first. Don't panic.

425
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,510
Come.

426
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,790
I'm back.

427
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,310
Why are you back so late?

428
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,670
I'm famished.

429
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,140
Can't you order food delivery?

430
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,750
I'm shocked by those enthusiastic supports

431
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,270
from my seniors.

432
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,110
I'm too shocked to order food delivery.

433
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,670
Even Jiang Yu Cheng's father,

434
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,910
that Chinese calligrapher,

435
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,550
has shared the post.

436
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,780
What about your father?

437
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
He posted something too.

438
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,150
Really?

439
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,180
Let me read it to you.

440
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,190
"Warning."

441
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,150
"One more share will save one more life."

442
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,270
"Eating these food together might lead to"

443
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,300
"serious food poisoning."

444
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,350
Is he really your father?

445
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,310
Why does he

446
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,510
sound like my father?

447
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,390
Since I've been working hard
for you the whole day,

448
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,550
can you wash the rice for me?

449
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,390
No.

450
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,990
That's right.

451
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,270
Looks like you are quite skilled in this.

452
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,910
That's because I learnt it
in the mortal world.

453
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,710
How much water should I add?

454
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,150
There's a measurement here.

455
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,590
Just measure it with your finger.

Use your middle finger.

are already considered as top authors.

If I want to forget about my past,

it means that I'm denying myself now.

even if something bad happened,

we have to look at the bright side of it.

651
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,590
Actually, when I first came to
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

652
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,870
it was so stressful.

653
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,030
I was suddenly in charge of

654

two top authors, you and Zhou Chuan.

655

Everyone was looking forward
to my performance

656
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,110
and some were waiting for my downfall.

657
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,830
But, these stresses are my motivations.

658
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,070
Because of them, I grew up faster.

659
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,070
I had gained new experience.

660
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,110
Besides, I think that
I'm very fortunate to be able to

661
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,430
handle both of your books for you.

662

I don't know what past that

666

But you have to thank your past.

667
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,630
Because of it,

668
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,270
you are who you are right now.

00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,510
Why?

841
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,590
If I hit 350,000, no one will cook for me.

842
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,950
What logic is that?

843
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,510
Are you drunk?

844
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,550
Go and choose the shirt yourself.

845
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,590
Where are your sleeping pants?

846
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,990
Don't change here.

847
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,870
Go to the toilet.

848
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,060
How long do I have to wait?

849
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,150
Hide properly.

850
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,470
Zhou Chuan.

851
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,070
I think this pair of pants

852
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,350
is too long for me.

853
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,430
You...

854
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,900
Go out first,
I'll get another one for you later.

855
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,550
Don't come in again.

856
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,590
Stop it.

857
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:11,060
Be good. I'll buy can food
for you next time.

858
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,540
Wake up, I'm not Er Gou.

859
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,150
I'll shave you if you move again.

860
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,670
Er Gou is so pitiful.

861
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,390
You even torture it in your sleep.

862
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,350
You...

863
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,590
What are you doing?

864
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,910
What can I do?

865
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,150
You were so naughty last night.

866
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,590
I couldn't even sleep well.

867
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,470
Mr Zhou Chuan, do you remember

868
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,630
what you promised me

869
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,180
last night?

870
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,590
Did I promise to marry you?

871
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,550
Don't believe it.

872
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,350
Don't worry.

873
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,270
Nothing happened.

874
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,590
Congratulations.
Your virginity is still intact.

875
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,470
Last night, you drank, you ate

876
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,710
and had fun with Mr Jiang

877
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,830
until you forgot about me.

878
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,110
Do you still remember?

879
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,990
Both of you really have
no tolerance for alcohol.

880
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,990
Don't drink if you can't drink.

881
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,030
Who are you talking about?

882
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,790
It's Jiang Yu Cheng who has no tolerance.

883
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,350
Your friend, Mr Jiang Yu Cheng,

884
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,620
is standing outside the door now.

885
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,030
Yes, it's me.

886
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,390
I'm not your imagination.

887
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,230
In order to avoid more misunderstanding

888
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,830
and more colourful imagination,

889
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,830
can you

890
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,460
open this magical door right now?
