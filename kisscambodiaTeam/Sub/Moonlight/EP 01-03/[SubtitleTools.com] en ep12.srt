Both of you are dating?

5
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,190
So, what's going on?

6
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,990
I dragged her into some trouble before,

7
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,150
and caused her to lose out on her salary.

8
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,430
She almost had to sleep on the street.

9
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,539
That period

10
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,270
was when Book of Luo He God

11
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,710
was about to be prepared.

12
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,670
I was afraid that her being homeless

13
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,350
would affect her creativity,

14
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,550
so I lent her my second-floor room.

15
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,390
Why are you so nervous?

16
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,470
So, why was she in your room?

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,870
Was it to hide from me?

18
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,110
Yes!

19
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,550
So, the two of you really don't

20
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,830
have that kind of relationship
that I imagined?

21

No!

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,750
Suo...

337
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,790
Mum,

338
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,590
Li Wei has guaranteed me

339
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,790
that he will be back

340
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,190
before Qiu Qiu's Sports' Day.

341
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,150
Ms Suo Heng, please hold on!

342
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,030
Ms Suo Heng! Ms...

343
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,310
That Deputy Editor Miao is really bad.

344
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,790
How can he dump someone here

345
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,430
with just a call?

346
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,390
Chu Li.

347
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,630
Do your work well.

348
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,150
Don't let your author down.

349
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,790
Book of Luo He God is making
a name for itself.

350
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,350
Jiang Yu Cheng even gave you
his new book to you.

351
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,670
You need to continue your good work.

352
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,590
If Jiang Yu Cheng can rise from the ashes,

353
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,910
it will also serve as a ray of hope

354
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,270
for authors who are currently in a slump.

355
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,950
I will do my best.

356
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,500
Director Gu,

357
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,260
this is the list of authors who will
participate in the Book Exchange.

358
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,230
Please take a look.

359
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,990
Is Jiang Yu Cheng not attending?

360
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,700
Jiang Yu Cheng has contacted us,

361
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,910
but he said he would not attend.

362
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,870
Put his name on the list.

363
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,220
I'll follow up on this matter myself.

364
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,910
Okay.

365
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,980
There's another thing.

366
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,750
Yun Fei's book has been on hiatus
for three days already.

367
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,710
We couldn't contact him.

368
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,350
Have you been to his house?

369
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,830
We've been there. No one was in.

370
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,420
I'll handle it.

371
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,550
[Hello, the caller you are dialling
is currently switched off.]

372
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,270
[Please dial again shortly.]

373
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,790
How did you find me?

374
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,150
You always play here
whenever you're unhappy.

375
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,150
You should find somewhere new.

376
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,070
Tell me. What's wrong?

377
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,310
When something happened to Ms Liu
the other day,

378
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,070
you just cried in front of him.

379
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,910
Before he arrived,

380
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,390
I was always by your side.

381
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,230
Am I so unreliable?

382
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,260
Just because of this?

383
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,460
Of course not.

384
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,750
Both Jiang Yu Cheng and I

385
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,390
write mystery stories.

386
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,630
When my first book was published,

387
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,700
some people called me
a mini Jiang Yu Cheng.

388
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,310
Fine.

389
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,910
So, I avoided modern stories.

390
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,150
I wrote stories about the past.

391
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,750
I just don't want to be called
a mini Jiang Yu Cheng.

392
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,790
But Ms Liu...

393
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,310
When she met me that day,

394
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,190
she also called me Xiao Jiang.

395
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,870
Then you got drunk,

396
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,550
held onto my hand

397
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,630
and called out his name.

398
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,500
I am not a mini Jiang Yu Cheng.

399
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,390
I am Yun Fei.

400
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,350
You're clear about
the situation I'm in, right?

401
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,350
That day,

402
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,670
I really was drunk.

403
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,030
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,790
No one sees you as just a replacement.

405
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,630
What's the point of

406
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,030
driving yourself into a dead end?

407
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,950
I don't know where you got

408
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,340
such messy thoughts from.

409
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,190
But no matter where they're from,

410
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,310
you have to dispose of them.

411
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,900
What's most important to you
right now is writing.

412
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,420
Don't forget that when
spring comes next year,

413
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,270
you and Jiang Yu Cheng will publish
new stories at the same time.

414
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,750
Don't you want to stop being called
a mini Jiang Yu Cheng?

415
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,190
If you beat him,
he will be the mini Yun Fei.

416
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,270
Sister.

417
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,510
Do you think I can do it?

418
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,870
Of course.

419
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,790
How can someone scouted by me ever lose?

420
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,190
Alright.

421
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,750
I'll be going back to write.

422
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,150
Go.

423
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,950
For you.

424
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,350
Thank you.

[All the complaints you've had of him]

431

[I've discovered that he's even more
outstanding than Jiang Yu Cheng.]

[I'm extremely honoured.]

437
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,790
[But an interesting soul and a toxic soul]

438

[are fundamentally different.]

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,590

He keeps asking these weird questions.

My standard of a partner,
is it Jiang Yu...

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,230
Hurry, look at the email!

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,220

00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,470
I was thinking about inviting you.

456
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,430
I don't like the way you played it.

457
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,310
What's up with you?

458
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,310
Are you not going to use a racket?

459
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,350
Don't talk so much.

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,470
I'll be playing against you.

461

Ever since graduating from high school,

462
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,150
I haven't played

463
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,590
such a fun match of squash with you.

464
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,260
You asked to be tortured.

465
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,670
When do you plan on telling Chu Li

466

that you are her online friend?

467
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,070
I don't plan to tell her.

468
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,940
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

469
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,100
[I'm honoured that you like me.]

470

[Who is it?]

473
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,430
[Zhou Chuan?]

474
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,390
[It's...]

475
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,830
[It's a friend online I made
a long time ago.]

[His name is Mr Fox.]

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,310
[Mr Fox?]

478
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,390
[So, does this Mr Fox]

479
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,590
[know about your feelings?]

480
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,390
[Does he also like you?]

481
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,310
[I'm not very sure either.]

482
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,030
[Anyway, I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.]

483
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,070
You've always been

484
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,550
an awkward

485
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,270
and indirect person since young.

486
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,310
I can't hear what you're saying.

487
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,710
Speaking of being awkward,

488
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,070
some people really are dense.

489
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,670
Just like a drowning person finding
a piece of driftwood,

490
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,790
then claiming it as his own.

491
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,590
When seeing a good umbrella
on a rainy day,

492
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,510
he wants to snatch it out
from others' hands.

493
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,910
She's been quietly supporting me
all these years.

494
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,750
It's quite unclear

495
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,740
that who will be the winner.

496
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,630
Someone like Gu Bai Zhi suits you.

497
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,510
Don't trouble Chu Li.

498
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,510
Stay away from her.

499
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,230
Whether or not we're suitable,

500
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,230
I'm very clear about that.

501
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,230
You aren't being jealous, right?

502
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,270
What would I be jealous of you?

503
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,860
What would I be jealous of you?

504
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,270
Are your sales better than mine?

505
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,430
Or are you more popular than me?

506
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,030
I'm warning you.

507
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,630
I'm Yuan Ye Publishing House's
ace author now.

508
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,780
If you get on my nerves,

509
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,630
I'll make them
end their contract with you.

510
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,910
[All employees of Yuan Publishing：]

511
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,280
[Mr Liang Chong Lang has been chosen
to receive the "Best Employee" award]

512
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,160
[and a cash bonus of 5000 yuan.]

513
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,190
Dear colleagues.

514
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,390
Mr Liang has bought coffee for everyone.

515
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,070
The sales for Book of Luo He God

516
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,030
have hit 349,000 copies!

517
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,830
This is the best result in
Yuan Yue Publishing House's

518
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,860
five year history.

519
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,510
The circulation department

520
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,820
is extremely grateful for the support
from our editorial colleagues.

521
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,110
Enjoy.

522
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,510
After waiting so long,
we only got a cup of coffee?

523
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,550
Mr Liang's sales figures this time

524
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,070
are just too strange, right?

525
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,460
349,000 copies.

526
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,950
With just another 1000 copies,
it would have been 350,000.

527
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,910
Deputy Editor Miao's spot

528
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,430
is about to be yours.

529
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,700
Chu Li, what a pity.

530
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,190
Who's speaking right now?

531
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,750
Isn't this

532
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,430
Sis Xian Yu who enjoys disappearing?

533
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,830
Editor Xian Yu,

534
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,950
do you think that my role
as a deputy editor

535
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,350
can be given to whoever you like?

536
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,030
That will depend on
the rules of our organisation.

537
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,260
I think that

538
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,670
you're not here to work,

539
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,430
but you're just here for a show, right?

540
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,790
My hip hurts!

541
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,790
Sisters, keep up the good work.

542
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,230
I'm going back to rest.

543
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,790
Goodbye, Sis Xian Yu.

544
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,870
Goodbye.

545
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,590
This is too unfair, right?

546
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,070
Not a single word is used to credit
us from the editorial department.

547
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,070
In future, our editorial department

548
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,830
is going to carry even less weight before
those of the circulation department.

549
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,470
I originally wanted to

550
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,550
use the prize money to change my glasses.

551
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,900
Now I can't change them.

552
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,590
Ah Xiang.

553
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,670
Are the wages from the firm

554
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,070
not even enough for you to change
your glasses?

555
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,510
What are you complaining about?

556
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,670
We're all from Yuan Yue Publishing House.

557
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,100
Those in the circulation department

558
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,310
spend all day looking at
advertising and sales.

559
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,470
Their job is not easy too.

560
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,630
You can't blame them for
receiving a prize.

561
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,910
We worked very hard too.

562
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,870
This is precisely my point.

563
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,750
We're lucky

564
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,580
if we find people like Zhou Chuan

565
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,190
who bring in their own readers.

566
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,950
As an editor,

567
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,950
we shouldn't be surprised

568
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,990
if a book like this sell well.

569
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,870
If it's unable to sell well,
that's a true achievement.

570
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,990
Once Mr Zhou Xuan publicised
the story online,

571
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,190
the shares by readers
were over 10,000 in an hour.

572
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,710
Let's not think about superstars.

573
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,820
But among authors,

574
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,990
this sort of influence is rare.

575
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,020
That's why I'm saying,

576
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,870
you as an editor

577
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,670
being able to sell so many books
in such a short time

578
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,550
has nothing to do with your ability.

579
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,070
It was just a matter of good luck.

580
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,110
People were praising the subscription
letter of the new editor as well-written,

581
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,070
but what do sales have
to do with the letter?

582
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,300
Maybe no one even read what she wrote.

583
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,830
People only know that
its Zhou Chuan's book.

584
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,950
So, they just blindly add

585
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,070
a few zeroes behind their orders.

586
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,030
Since you're sure that
Mr Zhou Xuan's sales

587
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,790
will be good,

588
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,390
why Deputy Editor Miao, you were unwilling

589
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,710
to increase the value of the contract?

590
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,390
Book of Luo He God sold so well.

591
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,950
Even a mere 200 copies

592
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,710
were related to the subscription letter
that I edited many times,

593
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,910
I was still the one who managed
to make his sign contact with us

594
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,100
even with our small amount
of guaranteed printing.

595
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,190
Chu Li.

596
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,060
Are you not satisfied
with my criticism?

597
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,190
Is your ego so inflated?

598
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,630
Do you speak to your superior like this?

599
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,230
What kind of attitude is this?

600
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,470
Living off peoples' glory,

601
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,630
is this your skill?

602
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,430
Standing on a house someone else built,

603
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,510
showing off shamelessly, is this skill?

604
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,590
If you have the skill,

605
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,460
you should build your own house!

606
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,390
Our editorial department

607
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,830
did not receive a commendation this time.

608
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,150
I'll say this to all of you.

609
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,430
"It is through work that we improve,
and all efforts will be repaid one day."

610
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,270
Okay, the quadrennial Huazhi Award

611
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,750
have begun judging again.

612
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,550
If the material submitted by

613
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,110
our editorial department can win a prize,

614
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,870
no one can take this honour away from us.

615
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,980
The Huazhi Award.

616
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,750
So, Mr Xia, which work from
our editorial department

617
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,070
do you intend to push forward?

618
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,220
From the first section,
there's The Edge from Mr Chu,

619
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,590
and Daybreak from Ms Zheng.

620
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,190
For the second department, there's
science fiction work from He Ma,

621
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,260
The Earth.

622
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,990
Mr He Ma

623
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,510
is a good author.

624
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,710
The chance of winning will be very high.

625
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,870
And, Book of Luo He God from Zhou Chuan.

626
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,030
Book of Luo He God.

627
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,990
Mr Xia,

628
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,310
Huazhi Award

629
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,950
is an award for serious
traditional literature.

630
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,230
Although Zhou Chuan's book

631
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,260
is a traditional legend,

632
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,990
it has quite a lot of
fantasy elements, right?

633
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,550
Maybe...

634
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,590
Times are changing.

635
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,110
Even the old heads judges

636
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,070
should know that it's time

637
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,340
to accept the modern trends.

638
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,150
And we should also

639
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,390
keep up with this trend.

640
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,060
Chu Li,

641
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,270
check on Mr Zhou Chuan's
opinion immediately.

642
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,070
Okay.

643
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,830
If Zhou Chuan has a conflict of emotion,

644
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,910
remember,

645
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,030
heroes struggle to deal with beauties.

646
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,670
Whether or not Chu Li is a beauty
is yet to be seen.

647
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,670
But, she will give it a try.

648
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,100
Don't worry, Mr Xia.

649
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,910
A matter like this where he can
receive honour

650
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,910
should not cause him any conflict.

651
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,430
Hello, what's up?

652
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,310
Mr Zhou Chuan,

653
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,910
from your voice,
I guess you're not in a good mood.

654
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,070
I'm hanging up if there's nothing.

655
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,350
There's something!

656
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,270
Mr Zhou Chuan,

657
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,470
Mr Xia brought up Huazhi Award today.

658
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,380
You should know about it, right?

659
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,590
You want to submit
Book of Luo He God for the award?

660
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,150
Impossible. I'm not going!

661
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,350
Hello?

662
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,390
Chu Li.

663
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,870
It's hot.

664
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,790
Ah Xiang, I finally know

665
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,710
why Mr Xia

666
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,750
wanted me to desperately
ask Mr Zhou Chuan

667
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,260
about Huazhi Award.

668
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,340
Ginger gets spicier the older it gets.

669
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,350
Mr Zhou Chuan was very steadfast
in his decision

670
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,980
to not submit his work to
participate in the Huazhi Award.

671
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,150
I can't understand.

672
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,790
Why someone would avoid honours so much?

673
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,390
You don't need to be so anxious.

674
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,140
I think that you should

675
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,590
have a good talk with Mr Zhou Chuan.

676
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,590
This matter doesn't only involve him,

677
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,180
but also Mr Xia.

678
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,820
Why?

679
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,700
Last time when Mr Xia

680
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,710
was in charge of Time Is Like A Song
from Old Mr Zhou,

681
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,590
he still wanted to improve it.

682
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,790
In the end, the book did
not win in Huazhi Award.

683
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,700
And so by mistake,

684
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,150
it was awarded to another book.

685
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,710
This kind of thing happened?

686
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,620
Has he never sent a book
for judging since then?

687
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,110
He did.

688
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,910
In the past years of Huazhi Award,

689
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,190
all the books handled by Mr Xia
were submitted.

690
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,830
But they were only given
honourable mentions.

691
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,310
He was snubbed again and again.

692
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,380
And people started to call him

693
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,150
the Murakami of the editorial world.

694
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,030
Being snubbed for 20 years?

695
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,830
No wonder Mr Xia is so vocal about

696
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,699
how he owes Yuan Yue Publishing House
a Huazhi Award.

697
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,870
If I were him, I would
be determined to get it too.

698
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,900
Yes.

699
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,909
This might be Mr Xia's last chance

700
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,550
before he retires.

701
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,750
[How can I convince Zhou Chuan?]

702
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,949
Don't leave.

703
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,310
I'm here to talk to you about work.

704
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,230
A lot of your old friends

705
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,230
will be attending
Xin Dun Creative Exchange.

706
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,870
I'm sorry.

707
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,190
I've already told your company.

708
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,420
I'm busy.

709
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,420
You have time.

710
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,390
You just don't want to go.

711
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,670
It's better for you to interact more

712
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,710
in the authors' circle.

713
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,030
There are many things that
you will not learn about

714
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,030
if you stay in this bookstore.

715
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,620
If in the future,

716
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,150
you wish to leave
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

717
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,430
and want to find a new editor,
and a new publishing house,

718
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,990
those information will be useful for you.

719
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,330
[Xin Dun Creative Exchange]

720
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,950
Who's there?

721
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,670
Mr Liang,

722
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,900
I need to thank you for
that previous matter.

723
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,430
About the number 349,000,

724
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,670
I understand your meaning.

725
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,710
Please don't mind that I criticise you.

726
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,190
You're already old.

727
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,270
You shouldn't speak so inappropriately

728
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,950
in front of a little girl.

729
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,390
You almost threw away your position.

730
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,470
I was too careless.

731
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,590
Who knew that Zhou Chuan's book

732
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,790
would be able to sell so well?

733
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,230
It's fine now.

734
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,430
Chu Li

735
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,190
is even more arrogant and domineering.

736
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,620
Why does she dare to act this way?

737
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,510
It's because you're the deputy editor.

738
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,390
Yu Yao is the chief editor.

739
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,550
She's supporting the little girl.

740
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,950
Would she respect you?

741
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,350
Miao,

742
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,350
have you ever thought of

743
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,420
a promotion?

744
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,710
There's nothing special about

745
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,430
the role of chief editor.

746
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,790
Look,

747
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,470
the wages don't increase much.

748
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,430
The workload and responsibilities

749
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,230
increase substantially instead.

750
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,710
Unlike now, I'm a deputy editor

751
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,860
and I'm still relatively relaxed.

752
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,790
You can continue to act.

753
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,830
You continue acting before me.

754
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,510
If you want to relax, it's easy.

755
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,830
If you relax, you will also
be taken advantage of.

756
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,860
Miao.

757
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,830
Thank you.

758
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,820
Think about it.

759
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,750
If you become the chief editor,

760
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,310
who at Yuan Yue Publishing House
will dare to take advantage of you?

761
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,030
Think of it in another way.

762
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,500
If you don't want
to work at Yuan Yue Publishing House

763
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,140
and want go to some other big company,

764
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,510
if you go with the role of chief editor,

765
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,780
you will at least be a director, right?

766
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,830
If you remain in your role
as a deputy editor,

767
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,790
you'll only be offered a manager position.

768
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,990
I'm sure you're clear of how

769
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,900
power is distributed among
those in charge here.

770
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,550
Of course.

771
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,980
This is your personal matter.

772
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,350
I won't force you.

773
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,510
I agree with you.

774
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,470
But,

775
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,670
Yu Yao was handpicked by Mr Xia.

776
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,270
Although she used to be busy

777
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,070
handling matters at home,

778
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,510
in terms of her work,

779
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,420
there aren't any major flaws.

780
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,470
So...

781
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,710
During the cultural exchange event,

782
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,900
wasn't there an author called Suo Heng?

783
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,630
She's a good friend of Yu Yao.

784
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,270
This Suo Heng.

785
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,590
I wanted to use this matter

786
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,790
to make her leave.

787
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,790
How was her sales?

788
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,470
If her sales were good,

789
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,310
how could I let her leave?

790
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,150
Didn't Director Yang say
during the meeting,

791
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,820
writers with poor sales

792
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,950
must be dealt with without consideration?

793
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,310
He repeated that their contracts
have to be nullified,

794
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,630
am I right?

795
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,140
What kind of person is Yu Yao?

796
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,110
She's someone who values loyalty, right?

797
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,390
This is something she's always stressed.

798
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,910
Will she protect this good friend of hers

799
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,380
whole-heartedly?

800
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,230
What do you think will happen to her?

801
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,150
She'll then

802
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,670
be against Director Yang.

803
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,430
I'm not sure if this counts

804
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,230
as a flaw in her work.

805
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,350
[Who's that? Didn't you see me?]

806
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,990
[I'm sorry, Brother Xiao Chen.]

807
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,310
[I did not do it on purpose.]

808
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,030
[It's you, Xiao Niao.]

809
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,190
-[I'll help you pick them up.]
-[It's fine.]

810
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,910
[Let me do it.]

811
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,070
[Do you want to go to get that checked
at the hospital?]

812
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,550
[It's nothing. I'm not that weak.]

813
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,910
[Let's go. I'll send you
to the editorial department.]

814
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,950
[Thank you, Brother Xiao Chen.
You're such a nice person.]

815
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,190
[This is just what I should do.]

816
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,860
[Xiao Niao just stood there]

817
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,870
[and barely moved.]

818
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,750
[And she found a free worker.]

819
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,990
[I've got it, Chu Li.
You try acting as a spoilt kid too.]

820
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,190
[What?]

821
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,420
[You act like a spoilt kid too!]

822
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,830
[Are you suggesting that]

823
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,190
[I should act like a spoilt kid
to Mr Zhou Chuan?]

824
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,830
Acting like a spoilt kid...
Could it be that it's useful?

825
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,510
My stomachache!

826
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,700
Mr Zhou Chuan, are you at home?

827
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,710
My stomachache!

828
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,030
Mr Zhou Chuan!

829
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,390
Mr Zhou Chuan, I can't stand it!

830
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:32,300
My stomach really hurts, Mr Zhou Chuan!

831
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,660
Mr Zhou Chuan, please save me!

832
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,270
My stomach really hurts!

833
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,180
Mr Zhou Chuan, I can't stand it!

834
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,950
Mr Zhou Chuan!

835
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,830
Where did he go?

836
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,190
Where did who go?

837
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,390
Mr Zhou! So, you were at home!

838
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,990
It's okay.
Please continue your performance.

839
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,110
Mr Zhou Chuan, I know that

840
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,910
you're a stream of clarity
in the literary world,

841
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,110
and the solitary wolf on the plains.

842
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,990
But it is really very hard

843
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,750
to get shortlisted in Huazhi Award!

844
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,790
Think about it. If you win,

845
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,150
then you'll earn something!

846
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,180
Even if you don't win anything,
you don't lose anything too.

847
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,910
From now onwards,

848
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,150
if you say another word

849
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,140
about this matter,

850
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,310
I will start charging you rent.

851
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,780
It starts from 1,000 yuan with no limit.

852
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,470
Mr Zhou Chuan,

853
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,310
participating in the Huazhi Award

854
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,790
is really beneficial for you.

855
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,350
Mr Xia is different

856
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,710
from me who treat authors

857
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,470
as weapons to obtain fame.

858
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,990
He really does mean well for you.

859
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,790
The words that you just said

860
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,590
inclusive of the punctuation marks

861
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,790
cost you the rent of 10,800 yuan

862
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,830
every month.

863
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,380
I can't even afford 1,800 yuan.

864
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,950
Where will I find
the money to pay 10,800 yuan?

865
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,870
Mr Zhou Chuan!

866
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,390
Won't you consider it even a little?
