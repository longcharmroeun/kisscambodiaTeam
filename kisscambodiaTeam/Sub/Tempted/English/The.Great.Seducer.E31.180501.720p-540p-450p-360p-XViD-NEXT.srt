1
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:11,955
Don't bring Tae Hee into this.

2
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,495
Darn it!

3
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,605
Seriously?

4
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:35,975
You know you're being ridiculous, right?

5
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,100
You're the one who started the bet.

6
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:41,015
You're not supposed to fall for her. You know?

7
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:44,485
Who gave you the right to like someone like Tae Hee?

8
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:47,955
You think you're pathetic too, don't you?

9
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,665
Imagine how furious Tae Hee must be.

10
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:54,235
Should I ask her?

11
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:00,935
(Episode 31)

12
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:03,335
(Lee Ki Young)

13
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:09,845
Hey, Tae Hee.

14
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,815
You called.

15
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,315
Ki Young, I got a call from Hye Jeong.

16
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,040
What are you doing now?

17
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:19,140
Oh, Hye Jeong called?

18
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:21,710
I found Hye Jeong and sent her back home safely.

19
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,925
Don't worry about her. But Tae Hee,

20
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,220
did you know that Si Hyun toyed around with you?

21
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:31,065
Tae Hee, hang up the phone! Don't listen to this jerk!

22
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:34,705
I couldn't let this slide. I just couldn't.

23
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,605
That's why...

24
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,705
I'm teaching him a lesson now.

25
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:41,945
What do you want me to do? Just say the word.

26
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:45,815
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

27
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,315
Ki Young.

28
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:52,955
If this causes a problem, it'll be bad for you.

29
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:54,280
Don't do anything.

30
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:56,610
How can I just sit around?

31
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,850
What if he comes after you again?

32
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:00,490
He's showing no remorse.

33
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,195
He's even pretending like his feelings were real.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,965
Who does he think he is?

35
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,560
I'll take care of this. It's none of your business.

36
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:11,330
Why... Why are you taking his side?

37
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,660
I'm not taking his side.

38
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,745
- He's just not worth it. - Right?

39
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,400
- We're the victims here. - Tae Hee, hang up the phone!

40
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,715
Shut up, you idiot.

41
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,045
Taxi.

42
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:01,455
Hey.

43
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:03,455
You stupid idiot.

44
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,425
Didn't you have anything better to do?

45
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:07,150
Do your parents know about this?

46
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:09,395
Let's just go.

47
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:16,405
Tae Hee.

48
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,005
What are you doing?

49
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,445
Oh, you must've been surprised.

50
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:26,545
He's bleeding a little, but he's not badly hurt.

51
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,310
This is too much. It's a crime to do this.

52
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,355
Hey, it's not a crime.

53
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,310
See? I got beaten up too.

54
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,480
I suggested that we stop, but he kept on going.

55
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,295
What are you talking about? You asked for my help.

56
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,835
Did you beat him with this?

57
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:47,905
This?

58
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,360
I just threatened him with this, that's all.

59
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,230
I mean, they never listen.

60
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,115
Hey, take what's yours.

61
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:01,615
Why are you here? Just go.

62
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:08,210
Yes, we should all go. Is that what you want, Tae Hee?

63
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:11,080
- You can't let him go. - He's already weak enough.

64
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,895
(Police: There's an emergency here.)

65
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,865
Let's go, Tae Hee.

66
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:23,235
Tae Hee, let's go. I'll take you home.

67
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,775
No.

68
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,630
You two can leave in a police car when they get here.

69
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:30,130
- The police? - I knew she'd do this.

70
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,345
- Hey, give me your phone. - Hey.

71
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,785
Tae Hee, you made a report? You didn't, right?

72
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,455
Even if you did, they won't find any evidence.

73
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,810
I just heard it all and have seen everything.

74
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,195
- I'm going to be a witness. - Take her phone away!

75
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:48,420
- She can be tracked, you idiot. - Tae Hee, get out!

76
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:49,565
Go!

77
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:51,865
Hey.

78
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:54,535
Tae Hee.

79
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,645
Give me that while I'm still nice.

80
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,775
Give it to me.

81
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:01,675
Give it to me.

82
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,245
Why are you blaming me for this?

83
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,825
Lee Ki Young.

84
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:12,855
Let go of me!

85
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,585
Si... Si Hyun.

86
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,985
Si... Si... Si Hyun.

87
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,795
Si Hyun.

88
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:57,605
Si Hyun, open your eyes. Si Hyun.

89
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,145
(Inseon Hospital)

90
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,085
Si Hyun, stay with me.

91
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:26,125
Si Hyun...

92
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,405
(Operating Room)

93
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:20,655
(Dad)

94
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:27,055
- Yes, Dad. - You idiot.

95
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,825
What have you done to JK Group?

96
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,825
Where are you hiding?

97
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,795
Do you know that Seowon is in a mess because of you?

98
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:39,735
Yes. I'll be there. Okay.

99
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,335
I'm coming.

100
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,215
What are you doing so early at my house?

101
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:57,340
I heard President Myung is getting investigated as a testifier.

102
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,555
I thought you would be worried.

103
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,355
I don't need you.

104
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,720
You'll be more helpful if you don't stick around, so go.

105
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,780
Don't worry about it. She'll be released within 24 hours.

106
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,895
And if she is found guilty of something and needs help,

107
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,190
then we'll step up to help her.

108
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,435
Stop talking nonsense, and get lost.

109
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:17,105
Soo Ji.

110
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,305
You need to be nicer.

111
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,645
It's nothing like how you look.

112
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:24,145
If you keep behaving like that,

113
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,215
one day, you'll get badly hurt.

114
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:28,215
Like this.

115
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:32,785
Lee Ki Young.

116
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,555
- Be polite. - What have you done to Se Joo?

117
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:39,425
Where is he?

118
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:41,495
Are you only worried about him?

119
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,335
What about him?

120
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,215
I love that little place of yours.

121
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:56,945
You're a crazy psychopath.

122
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,385
What have you done to them?

123
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,385
Stop swearing at me. It's all because of you.

124
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,210
You're the brain behind them.

125
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:10,125
You come up with the plan, and they go out and act on it.

126
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,325
By the way,

127
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,695
I had no idea you liked me that much.

128
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:17,865
Did you do all this because you were that angry at me?

129
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:23,305
Lee Ki Young.

130
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,975
I'm going to kill you.

131
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,175
I was right.

132
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:32,145
The best revenge I can give you is making them look like that.

133
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,040
If you want to protect your dear Si Hyun and Se Joo,

134
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,585
don't do anything. Understood?

135
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,455
I stopped by to tell you that.

136
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:45,895
Bye.

137
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,205
Give me your phone.

138
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,575
You're grounded for a while, and you can't use your phone either.

139
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:05,300
You understand why, right?

140
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:08,640
She's not grounded for a while. She's grounded for life.

141
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:11,285
- Goodness, Hye Jeong. - Kyu Jeong.

142
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:14,855
You will be punished for treating your sister like that.

143
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:18,380
Okay, fine.

144
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,825
Mom.

145
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,365
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:28,890
Hye Jeong. I am...

147
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:32,675
not going to marry you off to an awful family like Seowon.

148
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:35,900
I made the wrong choice.

149
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,315
You can also stop thinking about other stuff...

150
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,615
and focus on your studies, okay?

151
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:43,215
Okay.

152
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:49,455
Kyu Jeong, come out. Hye Jeong is going to study.

153
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,025
Okay, fine.

154
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,435
What's going on?

155
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,935
Why won't they pick up?

156
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,315
Se Joo!

157
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,325
Se Joo.

158
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,235
What happened?

159
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,305
Sleep well.

160
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,675
I'll come by tomorrow.

161
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,945
Let's visit Si Hyun again.

162
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:55,315
Okay.

163
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,415
Was it tough?

164
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,185
You won't be bothered anymore.

165
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,515
JK will do what they can to help.

166
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:05,785
Where's Soo Ji?

167
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,955
Is the vice chairman recovering well?

168
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,625
Yes.

169
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:17,465
In the end, only you came to get me.

170
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,435
Mr. Kwon told me to.

171
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,535
He's not able to call yet.

172
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,805
Thanks for coming.

173
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,475
Let's go. I'll drop you home.

174
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,025
It's so pretty.

175
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:22,865
The vase.

176
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,505
Where is it?

177
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,175
Soo Ji.

178
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:47,915
Are you asleep?

179
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,025
Soo Ji?

180
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:01,595
Soo Ji! Soo Ji!

181
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,995
Soo Ji...

182
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:16,975
The trauma to his head caused a cerebral edema.

183
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:21,315
He remains in a coma because the swelling won't go down.

184
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:24,015
We're giving him medication to lower the pressure.

185
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,385
We have to wait for him to regain consciousness.

186
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,925
Okay.

187
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,595
Where are his other family members?

188
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,465
They'll be here.

189
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:38,565
Okay, then.

190
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:11,365
Get up, Si Hyun.

191
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:16,305
How can you do this to me?

192
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,275
What am I to do?

193
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,375
We agreed not to see each other.

194
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,545
I told you that...

195
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,815
I hoped bad things would happen to you.

196
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:32,755
I want you to be in as much pain as my hatred.

197
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,355
I want you to suffer.

198
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:39,695
I hope you will never be all right.

199
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,405
(Myoungjeong Hospital)

200
00:18:56,638 --> 00:19:00,000
The cut wasn't deep and didn't reach her nerves.

201
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:03,515
Keep the cut dry to avoid any festering.

202
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:06,055
She'll have no problem playing the cello.

203
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:09,525
- I'm sorry. - Se Joo.

204
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,895
Whatever happens,

205
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,195
don't you ever apologize to me.

206
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:37,615
- Tae Hee. - Dad.

207
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:42,425
Is your friend still in a coma?

208
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,425
Yes.

209
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,195
I'm quite upset.

210
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,395
It's a lovely, spring day,

211
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,465
and you're stuck in a hospital.

212
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:54,905
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,775
Don't apologize to me.

214
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:00,975
You're not in a hospital.

215
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,545
I'll think that you're staying with a friend.

216
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,415
Dad.

217
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:12,485
About going to Germany with you...

218
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:15,155
Could you wait a little bit?

219
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,155
I need some time.

220
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:21,695
I want to see Si Hyun wake up. That would make me feel better.

221
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:24,865
Okay, take your time.

222
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,265
Your comfort is most important.

223
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,935
I said that...

224
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:33,205
your mind is a muscle with inertia and can't be controlled.

225
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:35,975
You can move slowly.

226
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,115
Thank you.

227
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:45,655
I had no idea I couldn't control my feelings.

228
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:19,885
Get well soon.

229
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:29,195
Take care,

230
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:31,765
Soo Ji.

231
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:38,165
Aren't you shocked to find out about the second son of Seowon?

232
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:39,820
I thought he was a good guy,

233
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,960
but he did things that a thug would do.

234
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:43,690
My gosh, I got the goosebumps.

235
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:46,405
He ruined the future of Seowon.

236
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:47,830
He messed with...

237
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:50,100
Samyeong Foods and Joosung Construction.

238
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,845
And the biggest of those is JK.

239
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:54,015
Seowon got shunned by all of them.

240
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,785
But Samyeong broke off the engagement first...

241
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,910
because they caught her daughter dating another man.

242
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:05,750
I heard the daughter's boyfriend met her mother at a karaoke.

243
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,425
- Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious.

244
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:09,995
No, that's not true.

245
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,490
Hye Jeong is smart and innocent.

246
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:15,760
I introduced a tutor for Hye Jeong.

247
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:19,130
I heard that Hye Jeong is studying very hard these days...

248
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:21,175
because she has to go to college and go abroad for her studies.

249
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:23,700
That's why she broke off the engagement.

250
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:26,545
It was a good thing that she broke off the engagement.

251
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,315
Hello, Ms. Jo.

252
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:32,755
Try this. It's very delicious.

253
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,525
Thank you, Ms. Jung.

254
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:38,780
Oh, right. I heard that...

255
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,650
the youngest son of Joosung disappeared.

256
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:43,150
All of his friends got injured.

257
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:45,890
I heard that it's all because of Seowon's second son.

258
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:47,265
My gosh.

259
00:23:55,637 --> 00:23:56,975
Reconsider.

260
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,400
Why must you leave? Why should you avoid them?

261
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:01,985
I'm not leaving or avoiding them.

262
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,070
I'm planning to rest and study.

263
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,510
But still.

264
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:08,855
It's my decision. I made this decision for my sake.

265
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:13,725
When I return from Germany after my studies,

266
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:15,695
do you want to be my business partner?

267
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,765
That's not possible. Our majors are different.

268
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:24,435
(Application for a Leave of Absence)

269
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:50,850
- My goodness. - Come on. Look here.

270
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,265
- Stop it. - Why?

271
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:56,260
- Look at the camera. - I mess up when people watch me.

272
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:58,730
All right. Smile like a fool.

273
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,475
- Unbelievable. - 1, 2, 3.

274
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,200
Hey!

275
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:09,940
How could you pour the sauce over it?

276
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:11,255
I'm sorry.

277
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:17,880
- Give me food. - What?

278
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:19,025
Hurry.

279
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,365
No, no. Let me tuck you in.

280
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:23,095
- Water? - Yes.

281
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:25,835

"Tae Hee".

This is it.

287
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,145
I'm sorry, Mom.

288
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:23,385
Don't be.

289
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,955
How are you holding up?

290
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:29,625
- I'm okay. - Just focus on recovering.

291
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:32,195
Don't think about the company.

292
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:39,465
But I haven't seen Si Hyun for a few days now.

293
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,205
Once you get discharged,

294
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,505
go see him.

295
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:49,675
What?

296
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,855
Si Hyun's mother lied to you to hurt you.

297
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:01,085
He asked me...

298
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,155
not to hate his mother.

299
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,025
Si Hyun...

300
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:09,495
was going to tell you after your surgery and once you recovered.

301
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:12,765
He was worried that you'd be shocked.

302
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,235
He endured it and waited for you.

303
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:17,905
You have to give me a lot of money.

It's the contrary.

307
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,845
You seem like you have the world to yourself.

308

My gosh.

309
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,185
I want to see her at least once...

310
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,725
so I know what kind of woman she is.

311
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,795
- Why are you bringing that up now? - It's because...

312
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,195
I wanted to be honest with you since it's over between us.

I can be honest with you at least once.

would you have been curious?

321
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:16,265
I would be.

00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:22,505
Thank you...

it mustn't come as a surprise to you.
