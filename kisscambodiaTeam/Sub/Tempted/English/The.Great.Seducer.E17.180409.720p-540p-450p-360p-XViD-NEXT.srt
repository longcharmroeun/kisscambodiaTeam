00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:08,678
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,963
Did his father call again?

3
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:29,532
He looks sad.

4
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:36,506
Si Hyun!

5
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,010
Stay there. I'll go over there.

6
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,513
What is it? Why are you running?

7
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:50,920
Hey, you have to be more careful.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,457
I wanted to take a nice photo to remember today.

9
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:57,694
Did it not work? You didn't hear the shutter, right?

10
00:00:57,994 --> 00:00:59,129
Come here.

11
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,834
1, 2, 3.

12
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,469
1, 2.

13
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:09,205
1, 2.

14
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:15,812
Don't you think we need something more?

15
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:16,913
What do you mean?

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,982
I learned this term from Kyung Joo.

17
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,784
It's "cliche".

18
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:24,354
It's something that usually happens in a situation like this.

19
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:26,356
Something like this?

20
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,158
Right?

21
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:40,870
You'll fall.

22
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,707
You know people do this when there are...

23
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:45,875
- rail tracks in the movies. - My goodness.

24
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,510
I wanted to try it once too.

25
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,213
- Why are you laughing? - What?

26
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:53,483
Is it because I'm not prettier than the actresses?

27
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:55,652
You're prettier.

28
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:01,391
What did you do when I was doing my homework?

29
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:02,592
I looked at you.

30
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:06,796
Did you save a nice picture of me in your head?

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,865
You said you keep forgetting it.

32
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:10,533
Yes, I did.

33
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,436
Keep it in your head,

34
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,773
and draw a picture of me a few months later.

35
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,948
Was the call you got earlier from your dad?

36
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:30,053
- Why do you ask? - For a second, you looked sad.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,288
It wasn't him.

38
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,258
- Si Hyun. - Yes?

39
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,028
Do you have anything that you want to tell me about?

40
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,464
Like what?

41
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,068
Anything. I will be a storage for your secrets.

42
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,304
I don't have any.

43
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,146
Hey, why do you not share your burdens with me?

44
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,783
I'm so worried whenever you look sad,

45
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:00,984
but you won't tell me anything.

46
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:05,655
I'm your girlfriend, but you won't share your problems or worries.

47
00:03:05,722 --> 00:03:07,290
I already gave it to you.

48
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:09,626
The paper plane.

49
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,634
You know, the paper plane...

50
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:20,703
Don't be...

51
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,072
a storage for my secrets.

52
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,675
Grant me a pardon card.

53
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:30,313
Forgive me at least once if I mess up.

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,382
Whatever it may be.

55
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,584
I'm afraid too.

56
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:36,886
In case...

57
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,257
I'll do you wrong.

58
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:47,831
Sure.

59
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:49,766
Granted.

60
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:53,703
But give me one too.

61
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,673
Sure. I will.

62
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:58,641
I will give you 10.

63
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,376
No, you get an unlimited pass.

64
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:03,513
What was it called? I'll give you an infinity card.

65
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:08,485
My goodness, you had to be the cool one, right?

66
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:10,453
- You had to say the coolest thing. - It hurts.

67
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,991
In exchange, I have a present for you.

68
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:17,193
- What? - Come with me.

69
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,236
(Let me live with the person I love.)

70
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:27,804
(I need a pardon card.)

71
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,472
My goodness, Soo Ji.

72
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:32,342
You're practicing even on a weekend. What a great student.

73
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:33,710
You bet I am.

74
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,312
I'll practice so hard until my fingerprints disappear.

75
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:39,082
Sure, sure. Eat up, and practice hard.

76
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:42,352
What are you doing? Why are you cutting and wasting meat?

77
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,855
I'm going to stir-fry them with rice later.

78
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:50,860
(Deep Pockets)

79
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:53,162
Hello, big brother.

80
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,632
What? Dad said what?

81
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:58,101
Okay. I got 20 people.

82
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:59,502
Whom else should I call?

83
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,740
- Kyung Joo. Call Kyung Joo now. - No, you call her.

84
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,708
I'm talking to Si Hyun now.

85
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,179
- This is why we didn't take my car. - This is good.

86
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,616
Of course. I chose this neighborhood to drink this.

87
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,252
You said you chose it for me.

88
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:23,893
But don't you think drinking in broad daylight is too much?

89
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,829
What's so bad about that? I'm 20.

90
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:30,333
Here.

91
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:33,336
Here.

92
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,839
No, thanks. I've never had makgeolli.

93
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,509
Hey, this is called the sit-and-get-drunk liquor.

94
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,011
It's sweet and savory,

95
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,846
so you keep having more.

96
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:46,249
And then, you're drunk before you know it.

97
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:48,585
It's really good.

98
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,198
How is it? Isn't it good?

99
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,034
It's refreshing like soda.

100
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:07,837
It's sweet and sour.

101
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:12,609
Hey, you.

102
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,310
- What? - Forget it.

103
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,045
Let's finish this, and go back to Seoul.

104
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,216
Gosh.

105
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:24,020
The sit-and-get-drunk liquor?

106
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,827
Isn't it good?

107
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,062
This is really good. What is this?

108
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:37,667
Hey.

109
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,737
- Si Hyun, get up. - What? Why?

110
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,139
- Get up. - Why?

111
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,375
We're going to miss the last bus.

112
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,647
You didn't even drink that much.

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,583
I've never been on a subway. I can't take that.

114
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,052
This is driving me crazy.

115
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:58,688
What do I do?

116
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:01,357
Let's call a cab. Let's take that back to Seoul.

117
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:04,293
Hey, do you know how far Seoul is from here?

118
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,834
We have no choice.

119
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,970
We have to spend the night here.

120
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,041
You're a beast.

121
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,244
Gosh.

122
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,047
Hey, we're going to go to a sauna.

123
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,949
I can't. I can't go to a public bath.

124
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:31,354
I have a dragon tattoo on my body.

125
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:34,257
- A dragon? - I need to pee.

126
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,459
I have to use the bathroom. Anyway,

127
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:39,328
I can't go to a sauna. I don't want to.

128
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,630
No sauna for me.

129
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,365
Gosh, what will I do now?

130
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,701
Se Joo.

131
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,270
- Hi, Kyung Joo. - Hey, Kyung Joo.

132
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,839
Soo Ji, you're here too.

133
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,474
Yes, I'm leaving.

134
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:52,642
Make something good for her.

135
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:54,577
You can't go. I need to have two here.

136
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:57,714
Hey, I can't eat grilled meat for two meals in a day.

137
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,649
Grab a seat. I'll make something else.

138
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,983
Come on.

139
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,388
Hey guys, you're here.

140
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,989
Soo Ji, say hi to them.

141
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,492
This is Eui Jae, who runs a cat cafe.

142
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,828
And this is Yun Jae, who owns an LP bar.

143
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:13,896
Hello.

144
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:16,265
Guys, grab your seats.

145
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,502
Se Joo. Why are you introducing me to your friends?

146
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:20,937
What?

147
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:24,006
Oh, right. Why did I do that?

148
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,946
- Why isn't Tae Hee with you? - What?

149
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,182
Well, she has...

150
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,218
a lot of homework.

151
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:37,720
Tell her to come over.

152
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,123
Everything is on the house today.

153
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,191
She went out of the city to do a project.

154
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:44,761
Really? Then I'll pack up some food for you.

155
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,195
You know where she lives, right?

156
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:47,764
I'll go with you.

157
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:51,667
No, she went very far. She might not come home tonight.

158
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,073
I really can't eat meat again.

159
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:58,908
I'm leaving.

160
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:00,643
Already?

161
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,450
Bye.

162
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,556
Excuse me.

163
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,129
No one is answering. Let's just go.

164
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:21,631
Yes?

165
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:23,800
My gosh.

166
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,672
- Yes? - Is there...

167
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,474
a room available?

168
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:34,777
It's the weekend, so we only have one room left.

169
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:51,460
- What are you doing? - What?

170
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:09,245
Hey, it's cold. Let's go inside.

171
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:13,583
What do you want to do?

172
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,219
You can't go to a sauna because of your tattoo.

173
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:17,453
It's not that.

174
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,258
Is it because this is an old house? Because there are no beds?

175
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:28,731
Do you not want to spend the night with me?

176
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:32,969
Hey, I won't do anything. I won't lay a finger on you.

177
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:36,706
I don't snore or grind my teeth.

178
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,040
What's with you?

179
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:40,209
My gosh.

180
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,213
I...

181
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:47,516
really...

182
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:49,852
want to sleep with you.

183
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,177
Me too.

184
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:58,354
I hope...

185
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:02,425
I never forget about today until the day I die.

186
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:05,528
Me too.

187
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,802
- What? - Take a guess.

188
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,143
"I..."

189
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,978
"I"?

190
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,981
"I want to wash my face"? All of a sudden?

191
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:00,850
It's not that.

192
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,553
Oh, "I'm shy"? Yes, I understand.

193
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:05,955
You're wrong.

194
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,124
I have no idea.

195
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:09,925
Forget it.

196
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:16,766
I love you.

197
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:54,437
You are...

198
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,238
nervous too.

199
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,647
Your palms are sweaty.

200
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,449
No, they aren't.

201
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:46,689
You know,

202
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:49,625
I doubt Tae Hee and Si Hyun will come back to Seoul at this hour.

203
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:52,294
Did you know that they've been dating?

204
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:55,798
Of course.

205
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:58,801
I see.

206
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,604
Soo Ji said Si Hyun would come,

207
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:05,007
so I figured you two thought they broke up.

208
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,042
Soo Ji doesn't know yet.

209
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,513
But who cares? They're free to date again.

210
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,548
That's true.

211
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:15,084
Si Hyun is keeping this a secret.

212
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:18,154
Do you think it'll be okay for Soo Ji to find out?

213
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:20,456
Hey.

214
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,625
You can't hide love.

215
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:25,361
I'm sure Soo Ji took notice too.

216
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,530
Right?

217
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:32,935
When did you stop by, Si Hyun?

218
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,120
Si Hyun...

219
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,623
isn't alone now, is he?

220
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,736
Play the cello for me.

221
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:10,206
Okay.

222
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,157
Did you sleep well?

223
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:44,326
Yes.

224
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:45,861
Sleep some more.

225
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:50,399
Where are you going?

226
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:56,905
Darn it. I knew it.

227
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,431
- Here. - What's this?

228
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:24,133
- Did they serve this? - No.

229
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,934
Tada.

230
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,476
You were prepared to sleep over.

231
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,349
We use the same toothbrush.

232
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:43,886
We were destined to spend the night here together.

233
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,654
This is yours.

234
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,023
Thanks.

235
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,126
It's mine?

236
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,697
- Here, have some of this. - Thanks.

237
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,233
How about...

238
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,903
we spend another night here?

239
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:03,972
Spending 2 nights and 3 days sounds perfect. I brought enough food.

240
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:08,777
Let's go.

241
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:15,818
- Hi. - Hello.

242
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:17,953
- 1 regular and 1 large. - Okay.

243
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,524
It's here.

244
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:31,500
- The large is for me. - Okay.

245
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,604
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

246
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:41,410
- Doesn't it look good? - Yes. You eat a lot.

247
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,901
What are you doing?

248
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:09,137
Hold this back and pour.

249
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:10,672
Thanks.

250
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,656
Just one bite. Please.

251
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:30,626
- Let's go. - Okay.

252
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,110
Se Joo's crazy.

253
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,113
How dare he do that to me just because I did it to him once?

254
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:03,959
Must I beat some sense back into you?

255
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:06,261
You fool.

256
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,501
Go on.

257
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,436
Hurry up and hit me.

258
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:18,173
Do it so I can go to bed.

259
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,409
Hit me!

260
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:26,415
You're worth even less than a dog's feces.

261
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:30,252
If you run a restaurant, you should buy the groceries.

262
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:34,356
If you can't make a profit within a month, shut it down.

263
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:55,277
I haven't been to the countryside in a while, and it's so nice.

264
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:57,512
It reminds me of where I lived.

265
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:58,947
Where did you live?

266
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:01,783
Jeongeup. Have you been there?

267
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:03,719
No.

268
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,121
It's so nice and quiet here.

269
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:07,589
- Isn't it? - Yes.

270
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,258
Jeongeup was like this too. The air was clean.

271
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,695
There were fields and a school over there.

272
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,501
Are you okay?

273
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:23,672
Stupid driver.

274
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:29,511
I usually stay on high alert near roads.

275
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,480
I guess I relaxed because of you.

276
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm so silly.

277
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:40,756
I was like this then too.

278
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:41,857
When?

279
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,159
When I got into an accident.

280
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,461
I was walking down a path like this one.

281
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:48,563
A car zoomed past and...

282
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:50,666
You startled me.

283
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,668
You're crazy.

284
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:55,771
It was a hit-and-run too.

285
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:57,906
Isn't that scary?

286
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:01,743
When was that?

287
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:05,681
It's been two years now.

288
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:07,816
It was during the winter break.

289
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:10,786
It was dark, so I don't remember what kind of car it was.

290
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:13,755
There were no traffic cameras or witnesses.

291
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:18,193
I rolled into a ditch like that and almost froze to death.

292
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:20,495
I couldn't walk for a while.

293
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,297
That day,

294
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:26,134
I'd left home after fighting with my mom, so we drifted apart.

295
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:30,706
I moved to Seoul after that and got my GED.

296
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:37,245
- What's wrong? - What?

297
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:40,782
What would you do...

298
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,752
if you ever come across the hit-and-run driver?

299
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,554
I'd make the person pay, of course.

300
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:48,256
I still have nightmares sometimes.

301
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:55,163
I bet that person's doing just fine, not knowing I almost died.

302
00:24:55,897 --> 00:24:59,101
Isn't that just despicable? How could someone do that?

303
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:08,944
What's wrong?

304
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:12,781
Did I make you think of your mom?

305
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,784
- I'm sorry. - No.

306
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:17,753
I was thinking about something else.

307
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:19,654
Let's go.

308
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,025
Ma'am.

309
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:27,896
Does Hye Jeong meet Soo Ji often?

310
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,999
Yes. She takes Hye Jeong to concerts.

311
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,602
Hye Jeong likes her a lot.

312
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:39,975
But Soo Ji seemed a bit daring.

313
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:43,612
I'm worried she might be a bad influence on Hye Jeong.

314
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:45,981
- She's innocent, you know. - Is that so?

315
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:47,983
She did seem so.

316
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:50,886
But I need to ask President Myung for a favor.

317
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:53,789
A favor? What kind of favor? Why don't I help you?

318
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,423
Myoungjeong can't be of much help.

319
00:25:56,792 --> 00:26:01,096
Kyu Jeong just received a notice for the physical exam for the army.

320
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:04,766
Kyu Jeong...

321
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,836
dropped out of school because he was sick.

322
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,405
He needs to get exempted from the duty.

323
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,575
- I'm thinking of asking... - Don't say that!

324
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:15,677
I'm not sick! Don't say that!

325
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:16,912
Okay, okay.

326
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:19,014
That's why he's very sensitive these days.

327
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:22,350
What did I just tell you? I'm not sick, Mom.

328
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,085
- I told you I'm not sick. - My goodness.

329
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,788
- I'm not sick! I'm not! - Oh, stop it!

330
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:28,990
- Hye Jeong! Hye Jeong! - Will you listen to me?

331
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,158
- Come on, Mom. - That's enough.

332
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:32,394
- Kyu Jeong! - I told you to stop!

333
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:35,463
- I'm sorry about this, Ki Young. - Everything is okay. Calm down.

334
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:38,400
Get lost, Hye Jeong! Let me be!

335
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:41,403
If you hurt me, I won't play games with you.

336
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,941
It was a hit-and-run too.

337
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:47,175
When was that?

338
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:51,313
It's been two years now.

339
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:54,516
We couldn't let your mom leave this world as an assailant.

340
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:03,358
Snake Bride, let's have noodles.

341
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:08,230
All right. Don't lift a finger today.

342
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,732
- I'll cook today. - Okay.

343
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:22,277
- Where's the assignment? - My assignment?

344
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:25,046
The assignment is right there.

345
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,157
My gosh, you did an amazing job.

346
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:41,763
My goodness, I told her to clean up.

347
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,999
I have to turn into the snake bride again.

348
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,912
(Explanation of Test Result)

349
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,183
(Kwon Seok Woo and Kwon Si Hyun are not biologically related.)

350
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:15,497
Si Hyun, it's all ready.

351
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,267
What are you doing?

352
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:24,339
This.

353
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:33,248
I don't know how it got there.

354
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:36,084
I was keeping it in my album.

355
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:37,919
Did it fall out?

356
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:40,956
I'll take this now.

357
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,223
What?

358
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:44,359
Did you...

359
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:46,928
read this?

360
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:49,998
Well...

361
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:55,103
I'm sorry.

362
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:03,645
Are you angry?

363
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,715
I gave it to you.

364
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:13,021
- Si Hyun. It's just... - I'm going to go.

365
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,824
Si Hyun.

366
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,998
- Are you hurt? - Don't come.

367
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:28,136
Stay away. Don't come near.

368
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,145
That's why I left home.

369
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,448
The day I first saw you on that bus...

370
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:45,353
was the day I found out that I wasn't my father's son.

371
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,525
I don't know who my real father is. I don't want to know either.

372
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,262
Even Se Joo and Soo Ji don't know.

373
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:59,501
I hoped that no one would find out if that was ever possible.

374
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:09,177
You said I could tell you anything that I wanted.

375
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:12,080
And what you've been waiting for me to tell you.

376
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,282
This was what you meant.

377
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,457
Be careful. There still might be some pieces left.

378
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,861
Si Hyun...

379
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:55,557
Si Hyun.

380
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,059
You're there, right?

381
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:03,765
I'm sorry. I should have told you first.

382
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:05,500
I was afraid.

383
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:09,104
I know that waiting for you to tell me first...

384
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:11,106
was selfish of me.

385
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:14,342
I didn't think that far.

386
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:17,612
Could you please listen to me a bit more?

387
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,581
Give me a few minutes. Please?
