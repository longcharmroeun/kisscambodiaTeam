1
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:11,181
What's this?

2
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:20,624
Tae Hee is going to complain that it's too loud to sleep now.

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:23,927
Hello?

4
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:28,965
Are you scared of thunder?

5
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:30,233
No, I'm not.

6
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:34,571
Was there anything you wanted to do on a rainy day with me?

7
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,477
Picking me up from school with an umbrella.

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,845
No, I meant now.

9
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:44,414
I will bring an umbrella to your school some other time.

10
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:45,548
Now?

11
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:47,851
Well, now...

12
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:52,289
If you can't think of anything, let's talk about it face to face.

13
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,303
Look at your pajamas.

14
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:08,972
Don't make fun of me.

15
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:54,918
Do you want to see whose wish comes true?

16
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,220
I bet it will be mine.

17
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,688
I kept it a secret.

18
00:01:58,688 --> 00:01:59,689
Not really.

19
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:02,192
A lot of my wishes tend to come true.

20
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:06,129
Please let my wish come true.

21
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:12,168
I'll have a good dream tonight.

22
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:29,953
Why aren't you sleeping?

23
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,688
I'll sleep after I stare at you some more.

24
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,027
Is there anything you need to tell me?

25
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:42,399
Yes, there are tons.

26
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,534
I don't think you have a lot to tell me.

27
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,936
It's just that you have a lot on your mind.

28
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,811
"Don't worry about your future before it's time."

29
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,881
"You don't know when you need to take a break."

30
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,984
"Running in the rain which you can't stop..."

31
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:02,585
"is equivalent..."

32
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:05,955
"to getting wet which is meant to happen in the future."

33
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:12,162
My dad used to tell me this.

34
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:15,131
When I see you these days, you remind me of these quotes.

35
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:18,868
I'm worried because you seem to worry a lot.

36
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,570
Tae Hee.

37
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:25,408
You're so mature.

38
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,245
Didn't you know? I'm older.

39
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:31,781
- By three months. - Hey.

40
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:33,783
Unbelievable.

41
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,823
You had a tough day today.

42
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:44,194
You visited that woman and saw your father today.

43
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,566
There are so many things I want to hear from you,

44
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,401
but I'm just going to sleep tonight.

45
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:55,104
You should try to get some sleep too.

46
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,742
Sure. Let's go to sleep.

47
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:42,886
I'm going to make a long and difficult confession to you.

48
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,763
Did you know that those two were living together?

49
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,698
No.

50
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,869
I came here because I was worried about Si Hyun.

51
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,505
I didn't have to worry about a thing.

52
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,376
I came here because I was worried about you.

53
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,647
Did something happen to Si Hyun?

54
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:13,816
No.

55
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,022
I won't stand in the way of their marriage now.

56
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:21,891
I'll let my mom do whatever she wants to do.

57
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:26,963
Switch seats with me. I'll drive.

58
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,132
I'm fine. I can drive.

59
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:43,146
Are you all right?

60
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,584
I must've stepped on the wrong pedal. What's wrong with this?

61
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,652
I can't let you drive. I'll drive.

62
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:15,311
Wake up.

63
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:19,015
Get up. Come on, get up. Let's exercise.

64
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:21,517
- Why? - Exercise with me.

65
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,653
Wake up. Come on. Get up.

66
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:24,687
Let's go.

67
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:36,766
I can't run anymore.

68
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:42,071
Hey, if you want to drink with me, you must be able to run this much.

69
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:45,274
Apparently, you can tolerate more alcohol if you exercise.

70
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,577
Hey, you're on a bicycle now.

71
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:49,946
- I'm going. - What?

72
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,816
Hey. My gosh.

73
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,877
I can get used to you driving me to school.

74
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:21,944
Anytime.

75
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:25,581
Since you're dropping me off, walk me to my class.

76
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:26,816
Of course.

77
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,385
Let me take a good look at the guys in your class.

78
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,021
Don't worry. I have high standards.

79
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:33,690
What do you take me for?

80
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:09,892
Wait.

81
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,900
(Accepting Applications for Exchange Student Program)

82
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,001
"Exchange student"?

83
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,437
Don't you need to go abroad for this?

84
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,306
Yes, you're right.

85
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:25,374
I was just curious.

86
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:27,076
You can't leave.

87
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,312
Should I go to college too?

88
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:34,016
Tae Hee, are you reading the poster for the contest?

89
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,987
- Yes. - That's the one I mentioned.

90
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:39,756
Let's do it together.

91
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:41,891
Hey, just ride my coattail.

92
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:46,395
I told you I didn't want to.

93
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,432
And what do you mean? Who's riding whose coattail?

94
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:54,403
You put your arm around me during dinner that day.

95
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,607
I clearly said I wasn't interested. Do you not remember?

96
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:00,977
I thought you didn't remember that because you were drunk.

97
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:03,746
You were looking at the post, so I thought you changed your mind.

98
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:07,116
I don't want to do this with you,

99
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:08,618
so don't ever mention it to me again.

100
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,221
Okay. I'm sorry.

101
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,891
Bye. Sorry.

102
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,995
Tae Hee, you're so awesome.

103
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:21,664
Keep turning guys down like you did just now.

104
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:26,669
See? I was only nice to you.

105
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,273
I must've been insane.

106
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:32,842
Let's go.

107
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,630
Why did you let go of my arm?

108
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,266
Right.

109
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,877
Why aren't you guys saying hi?

110
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:09,679
I'm going to see her later anyway.

111
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,248
Grandma called us all.

112
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:14,684
Let's go.

113
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,758
I don't care if it's the last time. Please hear me out.

114
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,374
Okay. It's the last time.

115
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,654
You came together.

116
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,390
Don't worry. We got here separately.

117
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:58,394
- Sit, Si Hyun. - Hello.

118
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:07,904
Grandma.

119
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,339
Goodness, my grandson.

120
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,475
- Have you been well? - Yes.

121
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:13,676
- Have a seat. - Okay.

122
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,649
Have a seat. Goodness.

123
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:28,724
Have some more.

124
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:33,095
I wanted to meet here to make you eat some abalones.

125
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:35,631
Did you have seaweed soup on your birthday?

126
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,767
I told you to come to my house.

127
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,669
I had a lot.

128
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:42,505
You look worn out.

129
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,841
Your dad must tell you off with every chance that he gets.

130
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,044
He doesn't. Have some more.

131
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:50,546
This is good. Try some.

132
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,016
I know he's busy working,

133
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,751
but Seok Woo has no idea...

134
00:11:55,751 --> 00:12:00,156
that it's important for a family to eat together.

135
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:03,993
He gathered the four of us for dinner after his business trip.

136
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,762
Seok Woo is trying hard to make time for us.

137
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,131
Eat up.

138
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,100
Okay.

139
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:16,005
I heard you two are close.

140
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:19,241
They've been friends since middle school.

141
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,477
There's another boy, and the three of them are very close.

142
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,879
I wasn't asking you.

143
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:25,481
Okay.

144
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:28,751
So you play the cello?

145
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,654
And you go to a prestigious school. Good girl.

146
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,357
Thank you.

147
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:36,392
Are you going abroad right away?

148
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:38,894
Pardon?

149
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,896
Are you not good enough to go abroad?

150
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:44,033
Is there anything else you want to do in Korea?

151
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:48,404
It's not that,

152
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,406
but I will think more about what I want to do.

153
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,174
I am thinking of sending her abroad.

154
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:56,012
She has no other interest other than music.

155
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,148
If you're done, let's ask them for some tea.

156
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:02,885
You two can go out and have some dessert.

157
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:04,520
Okay.

158
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,458
(Voice Recorder)

159
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:24,507
I never knew a meal could feel so burdening.

160
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:27,676
After they get married,

161
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,513
we'll have such a suffocating time in the same house.

162
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:34,383
I understand that my grandma doesn't particularly like Ms. Myung.

163
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:38,054
But we need to give her some time to accept her.

164
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,755
Please do understand.

165
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:41,757
You speak as if you didn't do that.

166
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,527
You were like that to my mom.

167
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,130
You said you don't want a car from a stranger. You kept on saying that.

168
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,867
But I still took your side.

169
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,303
Let's not get into an unnecessary fight, Soo Ji.

170
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:00,643
I wanted to ask you about the exchange student program.

171
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,378
Can freshmen apply?

172
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:04,246
We need your grades from the first semester, an application,

173
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:05,481
and a professor's recommendation.

174
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,517
- You can read that. - Thank you.

175
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:10,653
Why? Do you want to visit your dad?

176
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:14,023
No. I'm just looking into it.

177
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:15,658
And...

178
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:18,794
where can I find information on college entrance qualification...

179
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:20,429
for our school?

180
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,264
You can check our website.

181
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,501
One second. I think I had a brochure here.

182
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:27,736
Is this for Si Hyun?

183
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:31,474
- I'm just asking. - He can't get into our school.

184
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,144
I should ask him.

185
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,818
Snake Bride.

186
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:45,154
Tell me your grades and college entrance exam score.

187
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,989
I didn't take the exam last year.

188
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,158
Are you going to lie to me?

189
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:53,929
Don't be alarmed.

190
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,970
(2017 College Entrance Exam Result)

191
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:06,408
This isn't going to work. I'm going to have to tutor you too.

192
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,648
Is her name Soo Ji?

193
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:16,519
You should teach her some manners.

194
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:18,754
I apologize.

195
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,657
That's not why I sent them away.

196
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:25,227
I wanted to give you an advice...

197
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,996
and a warning.

198
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,499
I can't let anyone who talks too much...

199
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,601
become a part of my family.

200
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,803
What do you mean?

201
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,139
I don't know about anyone else,

202
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,143
but I know exactly what you said to Si Hyun's mom...

203
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:45,114
on the day she passed away.

204
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:48,417
I'm sure you didn't think things would turn out like that.

205
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,753
But things said out of greed...

206
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,022
will bring about a disaster.

207
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,793
Should we let the kids back in and call it a day?

208
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:00,362
Please excuse me.

209
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,181
I'm going to leave.

210
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,283
Goodbye, Si Hyun.

211
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:23,652
See you at home, Soo Ji.

212
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,188
Mom.

213
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,760
What on earth could she have said?

214
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:34,930
Mr. Kwon is really something.

215
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:37,132
Is he letting my mom deal with...

216
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,767
such a scary grandma all by herself?

217
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,270
Well, I guess he was late back then too.

218
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,007
- The family meeting without you. - That's the one I skipped.

219
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,142
I saw them that day.

220
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,346
Mr. Kwon and that potter at the exhibition at Joosung Hotel.

221
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:55,050
They're never going to meet again. Don't worry.

222
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,787
How can that happen if you're seeing Tae Hee?

223
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:00,789
What are you talking about?

224
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:03,492
How's your apology to Tae Hee going?

225
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,262
Why do you ask a question if you aren't curious?

226
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:07,997
Well, you know.

227
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,498
You two already get along well.

228
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:12,101
I don't understand why you told her and gave her an apology.

229
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:14,403
It's not like you'll see her for life.

230
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:17,039
She just doesn't have to find out until the day you break up.

231
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:19,608
Who knows? I might see her for life.

232
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:22,144
Si Hyun.

233
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,648
Relationships like those are all bound to change.

234
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:27,883
Do you want to go out with me?

235
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,218
No.

236
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:30,719
Why not?

237
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:33,188
Such relationships get broken.

238
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:37,126
Soo Ji.

239
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,663
All relationships change.

240
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:44,199
Friends, lovers,

241
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,401
and even family.

242
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:49,471
If you aren't sincere, it just changes a bit quicker.

243
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:53,375
Yes.

244
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:56,578
They do change.

245
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,082
I wonder...

246
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,085
which one of us wasn't sincere.

247
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,208
You heard that he is...

248
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:29,345
going to Jeongeup, not on a business trip?

249
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:31,980
The vice president and I went to the same university.

250
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,216
Since he's a guy with a huge background,

251
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:37,920
people followed everything he did as if he was a celebrity.

252
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,090
I've already heard that the two of them...

253
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,894
had an engagement ceremony, but Chairwoman Hong stopped them.

254
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,397
I've always known...

255
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:50,733
who his partner was.

256
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:53,402
I see.

257
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:57,039
A patient of mine recently gave me a piece of pottery.

258
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,375
I searched for the potter,

259
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,877
and her workroom...

260
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:03,946
is in Jeongeup.

261
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:05,848
I see.

262
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,884
I see...

263
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:11,887
the chief secretary made a mistake.

264
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,923
He could've just said he had some other business.

265
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,860
Did he have to go into such detail?

266
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:23,031
I shouldn't have told you.

267
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,133
No.

268
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,834
I'm sure...

269
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:29,838
it was because he knew how much you care about us.

270
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:33,208
I'll go and get some rest.

271
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:03,439
Hello.

272
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,009
It's been a while.

273
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,178
Yes. Do you have a lecture right away?

274
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:10,212
- Yes. - Yes.

275
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:15,217
Isn't that Soo Ji's car?

276
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:18,821
Her mother hadn't driven it in a while.

277
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,556
I took it to get it checked out.

278
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,959
I saw Soo Ji get out of a taxi this morning.

279
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:28,564
Did you celebrate Si Hyun's birthday?

280
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,065
What?

281
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,167
Yes.

282
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:37,973
The three of us always celebrated his birthday together.

283
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,642
We left school early just for that.

284
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:43,846
Did you celebrate together this year?

285
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,047
No.

286
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:47,583
He pushed us aside now that he has a girlfriend.

287
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:52,421
He didn't just push us aside. We had a huge fight.

288
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,558
Why did you fight on his birthday?

289
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,994
He said he didn't need us now.

290
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:02,431
I'd never felt so gloomy on a birthday.

291
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:40,202
You keep calling me.

292
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,204
That means you know.

293
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,641
- Young Won. - Yes.

294
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:47,843
Your son was here.

295
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,279
He didn't do anything wrong.

296
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:51,947
I just...

297
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,816
I just felt ashamed to death.

298
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:57,119
I regretted everything so much.

299
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:01,390
Why did you buy my works?

300
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,892
Did you pity me?

301
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:06,461
You must've felt...

302
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,463
relieved and pleased that...

303
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:11,300
you could release your guilt by helping me.

304
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:13,936
You and I...

305
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:17,205
We hurt our kids more than enough.

306
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:18,807
Also,

307
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,077
I heard that...

308
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,080
your wife died while on her way to see me.

309
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,215
How could you...

310
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,652
What did you want to do with me again?

311
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:35,557
I wanted...

312
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:39,928
to see and remember you one last time.

313
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:41,663
That's all.

314
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:44,900
It's all my fault.

315
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,235
Let's remember each other as sinners.

316
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:49,738
That's...

317
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:52,474
our punishment.

318
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:39,388
(Icheon Hospital)

319
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,456
Kwon Seok Woo's guardian.

320
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:42,824
Kwon...

321
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,626
Are you his guardian?

322
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:47,629
Not really.

323
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:50,832
Can you contact someone from his family?

324
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:13,655
(Father)

325
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:19,461
Hello?

326
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:22,297
It's Seol Young Won.

327
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,534
What is it?

328
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:37,946
Sure, okay.

329
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,314
- Hey. - What?

330
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:43,351
You should've said hi. Why are you standing here?

331
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,921
I was going to wait for you to get off work,

332
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,856
but I have to go somewhere.

333
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:50,859
Why? Is something wrong?

334
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,362
I think my dad's sick.

335
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,597
I won't be long.

336
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,599
Shall I come with you?

337
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,301
It's far away.

338
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,303
Okay.

339
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:03,438
Stay safe.

340
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:06,041
Tell me all about it when you get back.

341
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,910
- Okay. - You have a lot to say to me.

342
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,479
We'll have to stay up all night.

343
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,581
Let's do that.

344
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,356
(Nanpa Music Hall)

345
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,592
The full check is complete.

346
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:24,626
Thank you.

347
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,562
How did you like meeting Si Hyun's grandma?

348
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,565
Why even ask? It was suffocating.

349
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:33,201
Shall we go for a drive? I'm such a good boy.

350
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,904
I pushed my business aside to get your car checked.

351
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:37,973
I was going to go, but you insisted.

352
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,641
Was something wrong?

353
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,378
They checked everything, and the brakes were fine.

354
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,282
They asked why this was replaced.

355
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,717
Was there an accident?

356
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:50,352
An accident?

357
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,854
Was there a minor collision?

358
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:55,957
No, my mom's a really safe driver.

359
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:58,994
Ask her.

360
00:25:58,994 --> 00:26:01,963
Don't get caught driving her car in secret.

361
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,199
Let's go on a drive.

362
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,903
I have one more lecture.

363
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:10,906
And I'm going somewhere else in the afternoon.

364
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:12,240
Where?

365
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:14,242
I'll call in the evening.

366
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:45,140
I didn't know whom else to call.

367
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,643
I'm prepared to be chewed out.

368
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,713
I shouldn't get involved,

369
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,582
but whether it's physical or mental,

370
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:57,219
you know how he hides his wounds.

371
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,888
You really do know him very well.

372
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:02,357
What's wrong, and how bad is it?

373
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:05,627
Is it worse than what he put my mom through?

374
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:07,829
Si Hyun.

375
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,131
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:13,268
This could just be my imagination,

377
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:17,439
but I'm wondering if this is why he came to me after two years.

378
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:18,974
If I'm right,

379
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:22,711
then he's very sick.

380
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,148
I don't know how bad it is,

381
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,086
but maybe...

382
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,322
we're both being punished.

383
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,626
My daughter...

384
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:41,029
paid the price for my actions.

385
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:46,167
The day your mother came to Jeongeup to see me,

386
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:48,570
my daughter was in a car accident.

387
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:51,940
We never found the hit-and-run driver.

388
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,876
My daughter suffered a lot.

389
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:57,679
I'll live with...

390
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:00,181
the guilt and regret...

391
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:03,385
toward you and her forever.

392
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:05,854
I'm really...

393
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:08,490
sorry.

394
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:23,939
How can that happen if you're seeing Tae Hee?

395
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,707
What are you talking about?

396
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:39,054
Hello?

397
00:28:39,054 --> 00:28:40,121
Tae Hee.

398
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:42,390
Did something happen?

399
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:44,859
Like what?

400
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,362
I'm fine.

401
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:49,331
How is your dad?

402
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:50,632
He's fine.

403
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,568
I'll call when I'm back in Seoul.

404
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:02,777
(Soo Ji)

405
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:12,921
(Si Hyun)

406
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:16,358
You can go home now.

407
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:17,892
Okay. Thank you.

408
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:19,928
You started this,

409
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,131
but I'll end it.

410
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:30,572
She left.

411
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:34,576
She said she won't call you and doesn't want you to either.

412
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:37,912
Okay.

413
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:42,150
Drive me back to Seoul.

414
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:47,489
Why did you want to see me?

415
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:49,858
Just because.

416
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,193
Our school is close to this cafe.

417
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:56,131
I almost ran you over the other day, but I never got to apologize for it.

418
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:58,533
I'm sorry about that.

419
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,668
No, that's all right.

420
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:04,339
It seemed like you and Si Hyun made up.

421
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,041
We did.

422
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,811
But why do you ask?

423
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:11,679
You're something else.

424
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,417
If he dumped me like that, I wouldn't want to see him again.

425
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,988
It was between us.

426
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:22,424
And it turned out to be a small problem.

427
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:24,392
We are dating.

428
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,327
It's easy for us to clear up small understandings like this.

429
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:30,565
How much do you know about Si Hyun's family?

430
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:36,071
I'm not sure what you're asking,

431
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:40,809
but I presume you and Se Joo know more than I do.

432
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:45,080
Well, I think that I will get to know more from now on.

433
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,949
When I look at you, I can see you're so confident.

434
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:50,718
You think you can stay confident, right?

435
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:55,723
Soo Ji.

436
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,527
I know that you like Si Hyun.

437
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:02,097
I think you're taking it out on me...

438
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,967
because Si Hyun likes me, and you don't like that.

439
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,038
To me,

440
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:12,373
you look sad...

441
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:15,043
because Si Hyun doesn't love you.

442
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:18,279
Don't you dare...

443
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,350
pretend that you understand me or us.

444
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:25,620
Si Hyun told me this once.

445
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:28,957
He said that his friendship with Se Joo and you is...

446
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,627
something precious that can't be described in words.

447
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:36,531
That's why I envied you guys.

448
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:39,801
Because I wanted to be someone he treasured too.

449
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:44,606
When he was with me, he would leave and go to you guys.

450
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:47,909
There were times when I was disappointed and resentful.

451
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:50,378
But Si Hyun told me...

452
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:53,882
that I was important to him in another sense.

453
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:56,317
And I believed his words as they were.

454
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:01,489
After that, I was more at ease.

455
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:05,193
I was able to accept the love Si Hyun gave me as it was.

456
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,662
And I could...

457
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,697
follow my heart and love him.

458
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:11,599
You're...

459
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,638
My gosh, you think only your feelings are important.

460
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:21,409
You think your love is the only thing that matters in this world.

461
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:23,344
No.

462
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:27,549
It's just that you and I think differently.

463
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:30,018
The three of us aren't like other friends.

464
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:34,055
The secrets and pain we've shared are beyond your imagination.

465
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:37,959
I agree.

466
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,095
I don't plan to stand in the way of your friendship.

467
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:43,598
It means a lot to Si Hyun.

468
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:47,602
Just like now, I want to...

469
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:50,905
talk to Si Hyun about our relationship.

470
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:54,876
And just because I'm dating him...

471
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:58,146
doesn't give you the right to vent your feelings on me.

472
00:32:58,146 --> 00:33:00,615
I wish you won't visit me like this again.

473
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:03,718
Your feelings are your responsibility.

474
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:07,889
Sure.

475
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:11,392
I'm grateful that you won't stand in the way of our friendship.

476
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:14,896
But you...

477
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:17,498
are standing in the way of Si Hyun and my family.

478
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,101
Actually, your presence is making it worse.

479
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:24,138
Si Hyun's father,

480
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:27,508
who will be my stepdad, is seeing another woman.

481
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,344
Did Si Hyun tell you that?

482
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:31,412
Yes.

483
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,848
My gosh, Si Hyun. You're too cruel.

484
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:38,152
I will be his stepsister, and this will hurt my pride.

485
00:33:38,152 --> 00:33:40,355
How could he share that with you? He's undermining me.

486
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:43,491
What he told me had nothing to do with you.

487
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:45,627
He was just telling me his problem.

488
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:49,697
Then I must tell you my problem from my point of view.

489
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,034
That woman...

490
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,436
is your mother.

491
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:57,639
Potter Seol Young Won.
