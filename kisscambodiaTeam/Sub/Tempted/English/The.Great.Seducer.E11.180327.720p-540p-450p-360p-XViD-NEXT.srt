00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:08,945
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,085
I hate to draw.

3
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:14,855
With a vengeance.

4
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:19,050
Kids like us are taught everything from an early age.

5
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:20,325
I was forced to learn.

6
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:23,165
Would I have enjoyed that?

7
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:24,965
I shut her out...

8
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:27,735
because that's what...

9
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,035
I had always done.

10
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,805
I'll go inside first.

11
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:34,675
I have to call Kyung Joo.

12
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,545
It didn't bother me before I got to know you.

13
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:41,685
But after I got to know you,

14
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:45,455
I began to feel uncomfortable.

15
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:54,495
Stay.

16
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:56,695
Don't leave.

17
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,905
I'll stay. Talk.

18
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:09,445
I'm not sure if I'm fond of it.

19
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:12,415
That's why I said that.

20
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:14,345
Then you don't like me.

21
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:18,085
You wouldn't embarrass someone you like.

22
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,985
Not you, but the drawing.

23
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,750
I'm not sure if I really like drawing.

24
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:26,125
You don't have to explain.

25
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,865
I just overreacted.

26
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,335
You must've been hurt.

27
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:43,845
Look at me.

28
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:47,615
Come on.

29
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,355
Why aren't you shaking me off this time?

30
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,925
Why are you sticking around?

31
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:00,750
You said that when you broke the granny's dish.

32
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,865
I'm sorry for not calling in advance.

33
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,165
Please at least hear me out.

34
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,205
But all I did was blame you for everything.

35
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:13,705
I regretted that a lot.

36
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:22,485
Why do you...

37
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:25,285
keep pretending to be bad?

38
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,455
Doing that only hurts you.

39
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,525
Tae Hee.

40
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:39,165
You're such a grown-up.

41
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,305
What are you saying?

42
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,105
Go away.

43
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, stop. I'm not going anywhere.

44
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:49,900
- Don't come. - Come here.

45
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,245
No, go away.

46
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,155
If you get this nervous,

47
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:05,225
it makes me look like a bad guy.

48
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:16,705
I'm leaving.

49
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:20,205
- What? - You told me to go.

50
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,475
You aren't going to come out if I stay.

51
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:26,470
- No way. - I won't look. Come on out.

52
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:28,215
Let's go look at the stars. I know a good spot.

53
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,695
- Did you swim? - Yes. Where's Soo Ji?

54
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,695
What's Soo Ji up to?

55
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:45,465
She's asleep.

56
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:48,705
Are you leaving?

57
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,805
To look at the stars.

58
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:53,605
- You look excited. - Get lost.

59
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:55,175
Have fun.

60
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:56,675
But...

61
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:59,345
get permission from Soo Ji.

62
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:02,115
What permission?

63
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,885
If you started the game together, you have to end it together.

64
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:07,655
It's always been like that.

65
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:12,050
I don't need her permission. Do you all want to come?

66
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:14,020
You don't even mean that.

67
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,695
I'm just going to drink like a disowned son that I am.

68
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,255
I know...

69
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:45,025
that Si Hyun loves to draw.

70
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:47,725
Then why?

71
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:51,065
I'm just being mean.

72
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:56,135
I pretend like I don't know and I don't understand.

73
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,605
Mean and mischievous.

74
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,575
We have to hide our feelings.

75
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,815
What do you mean?

76
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:15,455
We like...

77
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:18,725
each other.

78
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:30,130
There are things we can't go against in our lives.

79
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:33,405
We've been taught that since when we were kids.

80
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:36,245
We can't stop our parents from getting married.

81
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,545
We have to try hard to be like real siblings.

82
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:41,415
And we do.

83
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:45,485
I'm glad that Si Hyun...

84
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:47,955
found someone first.

85
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,555
So are you saying that...

86
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,150
Si Hyun is seeing me...

87
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,865
as a part of him trying hard?

88
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:57,795
I'm sorry...

89
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,935
that you have to live with that secret now.

90
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,735
Why are you telling me this?

91
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:07,575
Because I'm sad.

92
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,475
Our story was closed...

93
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,515
without us barely opening it.

94
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:19,055
It'll be even sadder...

95
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,455
if no one knew about that.

96
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,415
Don't be sorry.

97
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:52,255
I don't mind keeping a secret.

98
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:53,985
Do you know why?

99
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,525
Because most of these secrets are...

100
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:58,750
a huge deal for them,

101
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,795
but nothing for others.

102
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,895
It's just a passing thing...

103
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:04,965
like a drama you saw last night.

104
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,535
Okay.

105
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,535
- Then I won't be sorry. - But I don't believe...

106
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:15,345
that people can always discern exactly how they feel.

107
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:18,745
Look at how you think that you should be sorry for this.

108
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,945
You can be confused between...

109
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:22,915
old friendship and affection.

110
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:25,285
I wish that was true.

111
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:33,225
How much...

112
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,095
did you like him?

113
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:41,535
So much that our parents should never find out.

114
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:07,595
I don't think I can go.

115
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:10,565
I'm going to sleep. Goodnight.

116
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:12,965
Is that for me?

117
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,205
I'll make you one.

118
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,635
Forget it.

119
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,830
That wasn't for me.

120
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:21,775
Goodness. I'll make you one first.

121
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:25,545
Do you want some marshmallows? Your throat seems swollen.

122
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:28,685
My stomach is upset too.

123
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:31,585
1 or 2?

124
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:34,655
Three.

125
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:41,895
Give me your hand.

126
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:47,860
You know that marshmallows are good for sore throats...

127
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:50,235
and where to massage when my stomach is upset.

128
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:54,775
We're probably the only ones who know that you're so nice.

129
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,400
The end of niceness.

130
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,245
You should've given me that cup.

131
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,440
You're nice, but you can't take a hint.

132
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,915
- It's for you. - I'll get fat.

133
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,725
It seems like she likes you.

134
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,450
Do you think so?

135
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:16,895
I thought we were going to stop trying to make her fall for you...

136
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:19,990
and then dump her. Why are you trying so hard?

137
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,535
Quiet. She might hear you.

138
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,005
You must be concerned that she might find out.

139
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:29,175
Do you not like that Tae Hee might like me?

140
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:34,915
No.

141
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:39,655
But I hope you will stop keeping secrets from us.

142
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:42,625
There are no secrets between us.

143
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:44,455
No, between the three of us.

144
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,595
Se Joo doesn't know...

145
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:49,265
that we made a bet with our marriage.

146
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,505
Is that for Tae Hee? I'll bring it to her.

147
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:12,085
Here.

148
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:17,125
Is your room cold? Do you want me to make it warmer?

149
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,550
It's warm enough.

150
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:22,165
How disappointing. I wanted to show you the stars.

151
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,465
Later.

152
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,865
- Thanks. - Sure.

153
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:30,335
Goodnight.

154
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,005
You too.

155
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:45,885
No.

156
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,655
I don't like you liking her.

157
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:09,975
A secret?

158
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:23,255
You have high blood sugar. You need to eat less snacks.

159
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:26,220
I have almost no appetite.

160
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,690
I need to eat something to keep my energy up.

161
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,220
Do you want to wrestle?

162
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:32,035
How much more energy do you want?

163
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:34,535
Your teeth are all gone, and you still snack.

164
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:37,435
I told you to eat less snacks.

165
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,500
I knew you'd get told off. Give me that.

166
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:42,045
Father, you need to quit snacking altogether.

167
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,975
I'm cutting down.

168
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:46,415
Don't. Don't laugh.

169
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,210
We'll treat you...

170
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:51,680
and make you new dentures. Don't worry.

171
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,555
Dentures are so expensive.

172
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:57,255
Does that mean I can eat ribs this Chuseok?

173
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:59,950
- You want ribs? - You'll live that long?

174
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,295
Do you have to talk like that?

175
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,165
- Hey. - What's that?

176
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:06,565
Gosh.

177
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:10,835
My goodness. What's that?

178
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:22,310
I haven't seen a photo of him this young.

179
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:23,985
He looked just like his dad.

180
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,155
It's been a while.

181
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,895
Do you mind...

182
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,765
seeing me here?

183
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:09,195
I regret that.

184
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:14,065
But I'm not apologetic.

185
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,905
I didn't do anything too wrong.

186
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,975
President Myung.

187
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:28,940
Will JK Foundation stop supporting us?

188
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,385
No.

189
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:32,285
The two foundations will merge.

190
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:35,450
I don't know how JK did things until now,

191
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,155
but I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

192
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,195
Thank you so much.

193
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:42,865
You donated hospital beds and leisure supplies.

194
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,790
You're so detailed and thoughtful.

195
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,935
Everyone's so astonished.

196
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,500
Isn't he cute?

197
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,075
He's 20 years old already.

198
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,745
The ladies here just adore him.

199
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,770
He kept coming here regularly?

200
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,115
No, he started coming recently.

201
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,055
Just three plates?

202
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:10,855
Tae Hee left.

203
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:12,425
What? When? Why?

204
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,195
I knocked to invite her to breakfast, and she'd gone.

205
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,695
What was I to do?

206
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,265
- Did you call her? - Why should I?

207
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,035
You call her. Over there.

208
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,945
I forgot to tell you that I have to leave early.

209
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,915
Thanks a lot. Have fun.

210
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:39,655
I'm leaving too. She can't manage alone.

211
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:44,425
See?

212
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:49,395
Is it a game, or is he acting like it's a game?

213
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:52,065
Aren't you confused too?

214
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,530
I need an espresso...

215
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,375
to wake me right up.

216
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:29,405
I shouldn't have gotten in-between them in the first place.

217
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,205
Why do I feel like this?

218
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,315
(Kwon Si Hyun)

219
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:45,685
Eun Tae Hee.

220
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,425
Gosh.

221
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,995
Why didn't you pick up?

222
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:57,695
I'll want to see you when I hear your voice.

223
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:03,205
You're so far from the villa.

224
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,405
Get on my back.

225
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,205
- It's just a cramp. - Get on.

226
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:27,495
The old ladies must've loved it up here.

227
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,695
The world looks different.

228
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:34,665
Thanks for coming for me.

229
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:37,135
Why did you leave first?

230
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,205
I had plans.

231
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:43,245
Was it boring last night?

232
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:47,145
No. Everyone was nice to me but you.

233
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,315
Did something happen?

234
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,385
I said no.

235
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,695
Look over here.

236
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,460
- 1, 2, 3. - Hey.

237
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,460
- What are you doing? - Come on.

238
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,630
1, 2, 3.

239
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:09,735
Stop it.

240
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:11,135
1, 2, 3.

241
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,500
What's that for?

242
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,630
- Come on, pose. - But...

243
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,575
- 1, 2, 3. - You're weird.

244
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:20,770
I came to have fun, but I took no photos.

245
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,685
You could've asked to take some.

246
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:27,685
Let's go to where you wanted to take me to see the stars.

247
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:30,350
I can't. If we don't leave now, the roads might be packed.

248
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,520
You can give me a piggyback to Seoul.

249
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,295
To carry you to Seoul,

250
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:36,195
we'll have to sleep overnight.

251
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,865
Why not?

252
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,705
Let's hold hands.

253
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,710
You followed out of concern for me?

254
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:00,785
- No. - It's true.

255
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:04,155
Your eyes can't lie.

256
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:05,595
I know.

257
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,295
They say my eyes are like Cinderella's mirror.

258
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:12,865
Snow White had a mirror.

259
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:15,935
Se Joo said that?

260
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,705
How did you know?

261
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,775
I thought he'd get things mixed up.

262
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:26,640
Did you think it was Cinderella too?

263
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,440
- I did not. - You did.

264
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:29,710
I did not.

265
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:30,940
Did you not read the story?

266
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,355
I did.

267
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,555
Are we going the right way?

268
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,225
Get lost again, and I'll kill you.

269
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:54,800
I'd rather you get drunk. Do you think this suits you?

270
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:57,000
Sit down.

271
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,045
Nothing beats fishing when you need to calm down.

272
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,715
You're really...

273
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,385
You're blessed at infuriating people.

274
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:07,385
You're worse.

275
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,980
I'll take a taxi back.

276
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:12,025
It's just for an hour.

277
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,205
Do you know how to fish?

278
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:24,035
Did your dad teach you?

279
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,475
Are you crazy? Would I come here with my old man?

280
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:31,075
If I did, he'd have tied a block of lead to my leg,

281
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,445
and I'd have become fish feed long ago.

282
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:37,215
I'd love to turn you into fish feed right now.

283
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:41,955
This is the ideal place to hide when you run away from home.

284
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,925
Who would expect a teenager would come here?

285
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,125
It's nice here.

286
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,320
This is where I first drank soju.

287
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,165
Are you proud of that?

288
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,330
How many fish will you catch? Tell me now.

289
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,805
I'll catch them all.

290
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:58,135
I won't catch any.

291
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,475
What?

292
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,405
It's not about the catching.

293
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,875
The fish are over there, and I'm over here.

294
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,445
That's good enough.

295
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:08,785
You're loony.

296
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,680
Leave if you want to.

297
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,955
First you stopped me, and now you want me gone?

298
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:17,480
You hate being alone other than when you shop.

299
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,925
You know me way too well.

300
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,395
So it's annoying.

301
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,365
Listen.

302
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,605
A fisherman once told the bait...

303
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30,705
to catch a fish.

304
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:35,045
But the bait became friends with the fish.

305
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:36,975
The bait thinks.

306
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:41,270
Should it escape the safety of the hook and sink to the floor?

307
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,715
- Or... - What is that nonsense?

308
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,655
Why do you think Tae Hee left?

309
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,425
How would I know that?

310
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,520
Say that you really wanted to find out...

311
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:57,465
if Si Hyun was interested in Tae Hee.

312
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:00,465
That's why you planned this trip to see them together.

313
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,235
But you know what? You became the fisherman.

314
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,475
What would be the next step?

315
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:08,570
You would have to tell...

316
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,645
Tae Hee that there's no place for her in our group.

317
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:13,545
What are you getting at?

318
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:15,515
But you failed.

319
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:17,915
Then what should your last step be?

320
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:20,885
That's not funny. Stop writing a story.

321
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:25,725
What did you tell her in the swimming pool?

322
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:28,995
You can tell me.

323
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,765
Why are you looking at me...

324
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,205
like that?

325
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,505
Could it be my interest?

326
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,075
Get lost.

327
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:46,915
Should we catch just one fish? I make mean seafood soup.

328
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,980
Just like President Myung's suggestion,

329
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:57,055
regarding the matter of the damage caused by Tiuzen,

330
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:59,650
the number of errors on the report will go down to 90,

331
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:02,095
and you will get an extension to submit your proposal.

332
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:05,565
If it goes your way, your proposal will be passed.

333
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:10,860
I was very worried after our first proposal was denied.

334
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,775
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

335
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:16,670
Businessmen like myself are relieved that a specialist...

336
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:19,270
such as yourself is planning to go into politics.

337
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:21,445
I'm fulfilling my duty. That is all.

338
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:24,715
Without JK Group, Korean economy is bound to face hardships.

339
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:29,580
I'm planning to use this as a chance to revise the regulations...

340
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:30,980
regarding the screening process.

341
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:33,225
Thank you so much for your help.

342
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:37,595
Well... I'm quite embarrassed to bring this up.

343
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:40,390
I'm wondering if there would be an available position...

344
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:42,535
for internship at the PR Team in JK.

345
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:45,205
My oldest will graduate college soon.

346
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,705
I told her to major in science, but she majored in liberal arts.

347
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:50,345
Getting a job is hard these days.

348
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:54,115
All right. I will look into it.

349
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,885
Internship is nothing, sir.

350
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:01,185
We can give her a full-time job.

351
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,955
My goodness. I didn't expect that.

352
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:05,620
That's all right.

353
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:07,620
But how far could she go after getting a job in JK...

354
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:09,195
through connections?

355
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:12,265
15 years later, would she be a manager for the PR Team?

356
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:15,030
Listen, President Myung.

357
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,660
During hearings, politicians lose their support because of favors...

358
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,275
they asked for their children.

359
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:20,975
You must make a mark in politics.

360
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:24,845
You can't spoil your big plan because of this small matter.

361
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,980
We do anything for our children, don't we?

362
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:36,955
I asked this daring lady for a foolish favor.

363
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:42,295
You have joined hands with an amazing lady.

364
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:43,495
Congratulations.

365
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,135
Thank you.

366
00:23:46,595 --> 00:23:49,735
I'll get going first since I'm quite embarrassed.

367
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:53,105
Enjoy your meal, and let me buy you a celebratory drink next time.

368
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,375
Bye then.

369
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:05,810
What did you do over the weekend?

370
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:08,650
It looks like it was a relaxing one. You look great.

371
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,825
It's the same.

372
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:13,525
I worked, exercised, and went for a drive.

373
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,195
Spend some time with your son.

374
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:19,735
- I did. - Is that so?

375
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:26,005
I'm thinking of sending Soo Ji abroad for her studies.

376
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:29,375
Is that what she wants?

377
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,845
Soo Ji isn't studying cello for nothing.

378
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,910
She will say she doesn't want to, but she'll think about it and go.

379
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:37,015
I see.

380
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:39,910
Since your family runs a business,

381
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:42,725
I never thought that she'd want to become a cellist.

382
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:46,920
If we weren't getting married, I was going to donate...

383
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:49,320
the hospital and business to our society.

384
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:51,395
And Soo Ji could have studied music for all her life.

385
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:57,635
I mean it.

386
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:00,605
I'm telling you...

387
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:04,775
not to worry about giving her shares of the company or anything.

388
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:08,815
I'll tell the chairwoman once she returns.

389
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:11,215
I didn't worry about it.

390
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:15,355
I hope she becomes a great musician and chairs the cultural foundation.

391
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:22,990
What does Si Hyun want to do? Won't he reapply for college?

392
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:25,195
He should inherit the company.

393
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,665
Why don't I have a talk with him?

394
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:32,005
Why do you want to do that?

395
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,375
Pardon?

396
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:37,775
Don't confuse yourself with the purpose of our marriage.

397
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:42,210
Secretary Yoon...

398
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,255
tells me Si Hyun asked him about his mother's car accident.

399
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:46,955
Did you know that?

400
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:50,055
No.

401
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,725
I will handle him.

402
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:12,045
She sleeps like a baby.

403
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,970
- Look at the camera, please. - Hey.

404
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,175
Why?

405
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:46,340
- Look at the camera. - I'll mess up if you do that.

406
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,485
- Look here. - My gosh.

407
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:51,740
Hey, you looked so aloof when I first met you,

408
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:53,480
but you look like a dummy when you smile.

409
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,680
Look at this one. Your eyes disappeared.

410
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:58,155
I know. Soo Ji always tells me that I look like a fool.

411
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:03,420
I see. "Fool" does suit you perfectly.

412
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:04,820
Are they back in Seoul now?

413
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:06,965
I don't know. She didn't answer my call.

414
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:08,835
You should call Se Joo too.

415
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,560
It's probably off.

416
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:14,830
He's away running away from home for 359 days every year.

417
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,100
What about the remaining six days?

418
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:18,575
5 days for the memorial service. 1 day for his dad's birthday.

419
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:25,055
- You guys seemed pretty close. - Well, we are always together.

420
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:28,625
Was there a time when you guys almost dated each other?

421
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,595
It's all done. Let's eat.

422
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:42,105
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy your food.

423
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:48,645
Why do you keep taking photos?

424
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,715
It's been decades since someone cooked for me.

425
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:53,145
I like it.

426
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,385
Give it to me. Let me take one for you.

427
00:27:57,846 --> 00:27:58,985
Okay.

428
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,655
I'll make you look pretty. 1, 2.

429
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:04,955
Here. Let's eat.

430
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:09,790
- Lift your plate too. - What?

431
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,965
Come on.

432
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,205
- Here we go. Smile like a fool. - You're unbelievable.

433
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:20,605
1, 2, 3.

434
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,855
You can take one too.

435
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:37,255
Eat up. Or it will get soggy.

436
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,920
My gosh, this is so good. Come on, try it.

437
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,065
Okay.

438
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:50,360
I didn't get to practice because of you. What time is it?

439
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:53,130
You mixed rice with the soup. Don't pretend you didn't like it.

440
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:55,475
I can't believe you. I should just get a driver's license.

441
00:28:58,606 --> 00:28:59,745
Darn it.

442
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,040
- Gosh. - Who are those people?

443
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:03,040
Open up.

444
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:05,510
- Soo Ji, take care of the dash cam. - Open the door. Open up.

445
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:06,980
- Get him out. - Soo Ji.

446
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:09,850
- Se Joo! Hey! - Soo Ji, don't come out. Don't.

447
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,280
Let me go! Let go of me.

448
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:14,125
- What have you done now? - Don't come out. I'm all right.

449
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,295
(Soo Ji)

450
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:18,195
Yes, Soo Ji?

451
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,165
What is it?

452
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,035
Okay. I'm on my way.

453
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:25,600
- What happened? - I think there's a problem.

454
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,205
- Don't wait for me. Eat up. - Should I come?

455
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:34,945
Why are you in such a hurry?

456
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:38,980
Did he take out private loans? No, he's kidnapped.

457
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,285
I told him so many times not to act rich.

458
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:44,055
At a glance, it doesn't look like his family is loaded.

459
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:46,050
Hey, this must involve a married woman.

460
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:49,965
Her husband is the head of a gang. He knows how to pick them, right?

461
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:52,190
- Should we report it now? - Stop talking nonsense.

462
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:53,860
His family took him.

463
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:57,235
- Go back in. He will call soon. - Stay for a while.

464
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,005
Why are you in a rush to leave?

465
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,645
Wait until we confirm he's alive.

466
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:06,045
Where will you go?

467
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:15,750
- Today was the memorial service. - This lunatic.

468
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,850
If he had the memorial service, he should've gone home early.

469
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,225
Why would he go fishing?

470
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:20,725
You went to the fishing site, right?

471
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:23,095
Isn't his spicy seafood soup good?

472
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:27,865
You've been there too? Seriously. He said it was a secret.

473
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:39,540
Did you just get here? It's late.

474
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,600
- Hello. - Bye, Si Hyun.

475
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,840
Why don't you come in and talk? Why are you standing here?

476
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:45,440
No, I was just leaving.

477
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:48,085
Don't make him come in. It's uncomfortable. You should go now.

478
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:49,755
It's Sunday. Where were you?

479
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:51,955
I was with his dad.

480
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:55,095
He must be home by now.

481
00:30:57,392 --> 00:31:00,765
- He didn't even drop you off. - We're not kids. We both have cars.

482
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,530
I'll get going now.

483
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:06,275
Si Hyun, your car seems pretty old.

484
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:09,145
I'll buy you a new one. Which model do you want?

485
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:11,275
Is that your dowry?

486
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:14,470
Si Hyun's family is richer than us. Buy me a car.

487
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:16,085
You don't even have a license.

488
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:21,155
- Buy her a car. I don't need one. - No, I want to buy you one.

489
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:24,655
The car was in an accident once. It might bring bad luck.

490
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:30,695
No.

491
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:32,765
I'm going to keep this car.

492
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:36,760
Mom promised me this car when I turned 20.

493
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:40,505
And I don't want to get a car from other people.

494
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:45,045
If I don't get to drive this car, I will buy a car with my own money.

495
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:50,810
Okay. I just got excited. I shouldn't have said that.

496
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,185
Drive safely.

497
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,585
Okay.

498
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:04,895
Did you have to say that to her?

499
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:33,725
(Kwon Si Hyun)

500
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:45,535
(Kwon Si Hyun)

501
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,365
- Tae Hee. - My gosh.

502
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:13,965
What's going on?

503
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:15,535
What?

504
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,635
Kyung... Kyung Joo.

505
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:21,605
You're so lucky!

506
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:24,270
Just move in together. You two should live together.

507
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:25,815
What are you saying? Be quiet.

508
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:28,475
I don't see you in any of these photos.

509
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,115
What about the swimming pool? Do you have photos of Se Joo?

510
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:33,155
He didn't swim.

511
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:35,455
What about Soo Ji?

512
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:36,855
She came.

513
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:39,325
Why did she come if Se Joo wasn't there?

514
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:41,025
I don't know.

515
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,895
Hey, don't tell Se Joo what I said, okay?

516
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:48,705
That sign and expression is Kyung Joo's trademark.

517
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,005
How did you know that?

518
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:56,145
I see Kyung Joo every now and then.

519
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:59,245
She talks about you a lot.

520
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:00,570
What else did you tell him?

521
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:04,185
Soo Ji wanted to know more about you to help you with Si Hyun.

522
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:05,885
So I told her a bit about you.

523
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:07,385
What?

524
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:14,295
Then...

525
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,895
that means the three of them talked about me together.

526
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:19,835
It's natural since they're best friends.

527
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:21,835
You should play hard-to-get too.

528
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:24,205
- What? - That's what he's doing now.

529
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,205
Why would he go to Soo Ji during dinner?

530
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:28,975
Stop it.

531
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:31,275
I'm already confused as it is.

532
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:34,645
He was coming at me at the speed of 100.

533
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:37,985
80, 110, 50...

534
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:40,010
It feels like he's changing his speed.

535
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,580
Speed isn't everything in dating.

536
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:42,980
You don't have to obey the speed limit.

537
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:45,495
Make a left or right turn. Try to have fresh perspectives.

538
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,025
I don't know.

539
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:48,895
I'll just do what I want.
