00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,355
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:10,225
Si Hyun.

3
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:13,110
I went to your place today...

4
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:15,425
and brought your pillow.

5
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,290
Do you remember...

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,995
that rainy day when I came over with a pillow?

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,875
I hadn't been to your place in a while.

8
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:28,935
As soon as I stepped in,

9
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,645
I smelled the scent I had smelled on you.

10
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,015
I didn't notice it before,

11
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:35,975
but I did today.

12
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,770
It was nice to see the drawings...

13
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:41,185
on the glass wall after all this while.

14
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:43,985
Hey.

15
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,795
I'm talking to you.

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,155
You should listen.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,865
You should cook me noodles as you listen.

18
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:55,920
Do the cleaning while I do my homework...

19
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,535
and make me coffee.

20
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:02,475
You should also nag me to get out and see the sun.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,505
You called yourself my snake bride.

22
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,255
Just like that night,

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,525
I'll stay with you tonight.

24
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:30,135
So wake up with me tomorrow.

25
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:35,005
You need to wake up tomorrow to see the spring weather...

26
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,505
and talk to me.

27
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,305
Okay?

28
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,705
You made this for me, didn't you?

29
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:44,475
Can I read it?

30
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,175
Back then,

31
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,045
I read your paper plane without your permission.

32
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,155
I felt so bad.

33
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:58,855
I thought that was why you broke up with me...

34
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,795
and had such a hard time.

35
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:05,895
Anyway, I'll read this.

36
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,775
To my hidden but a great joy,

37
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:16,305
Tae Hee.

38
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:22,075
I don't know where and how to begin,

39
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,415
but I must tell you of something terrible...

40
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:26,885
I've done to you.

41
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:31,555
I must make a long and very hard confession.

42
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,425
I thought a lot about where to start...

43
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:39,725
and started by drawing your face.

44
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:42,595
At first, it was to avoid confessing to you.

45
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,565
To earn some time.

46
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:47,175
That was my excuse.

47
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,575
Very slowly, I started to ask your portraits for forgiveness.

48
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:54,845
They offered me comfort.

49
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:59,345
I should've told you how much I liked your smiling face.

50
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,955
Whenever I looked into your eyes that showed your soul,

51
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:05,985
my heart thumped.

52
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:08,625
I should've told you all this often.

53
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,295
When you smiled at me,

54
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:15,365
I forgot all about what I'd done wrong.

55
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:17,405
Then one day,

56
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:21,305
I started to fear the day the secrets would come out.

57
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,005
Time kept passing by.

58
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:29,175
You were the first person who smiled at me so brightly.

59
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,615
If I go back,

60
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:34,255
I don't want to tempt you with lies,

61
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:37,825
treat you like a joke and hurt you,

62
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:40,425
or make you cry.

63
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:44,865
I would only...

64
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,335
treat you with sincerity.

65
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:52,335
Si Hyun, don't you have something to confess to me?

66
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,305
The right to love you...

67
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,330
No.

68
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,760
- No. - Since when did you like me?

69
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,030
To earn the right to even remember you...

70
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,175
I came to like you so much that I forgot about...

71
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:02,945
how guilty I felt.

72
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:06,815
I convince myself that I must tell you everything,

73
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,115
but again today,

74
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,685
I draw your face.

75
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:15,195
The biggest punishment for me...

76
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,265
is not to be able to remember you.

77
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,995
The saddest punishment for me...

78
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:25,265
is for you to remember me with hatred.

79
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:28,135
Even if that day comes,

80
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:31,045
I wish to remember your smiling face.

81
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,645
Even if you don't forgive me,

82
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,345
I wish that we can reminisce.

83
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,915
Now, that is the only thing I want.

84
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:43,155
From Si Hyun.

85
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,235
Si Hyun.

86
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:58,065
This is not me.

87
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:02,035
It's the me that liked you.

88
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,875
I was able to smile like this...

89
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:11,445
because you were there...

90
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,355
and because I smiled at you.

91
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:19,555
For me to be able to smile again,

92
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,155
you need to wake up.

93
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,185
Where did Se Joo go?

94
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,885
Just stick with me. I'll show you some fun places.

95
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:52,225
When it snows...

96
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,225
or when it rains...

97
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:57,625
Whenever I want to be here,

98
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:00,225
you said you'd bring me.

99
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:02,835
It's so hard.

100
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:05,505
Now, I have to come here alone.

101
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,945
Wherever you are, I hope you're well.

102
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:17,485
Don't you ever be alone.

103
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,015
You must be with someone.

104
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,605
Let's go.

105
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,605
Here it is.

106
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,705
Call Kwon Si Hyun's doctor.

107
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,385
Kyung Joo.

108
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,055
Can you go and check?

109
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:02,155
What? Okay.

110
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:06,225
Kwon Si Hyun. Kwon Si Hyun.

111
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,520
Do you hear me?

112
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,995
- He woke up. - After over 15 days?

113
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,205
Tae Hee.

114
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,935
He's awake.

115
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:21,345
Si Hyun's awake.

116
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,045
He's awake?

117
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:26,985
Are you sure?

118
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:48,975
Let me have a look.

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,875
Okay, good.

120
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,715
Buzz if you need anything.

121
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,915
Let's go.

122
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:31,815
Tae Hee.

123
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:47,125
Are you really not going to see him?

124
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,905
- No. - Come on.

125
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,805
I don't think we should see each other right now.

126
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:59,845
Much later, after we both get healthier...

127
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,915
When nothing we talk about can hurt us,

128
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,345
that's when I want to see him again.

129
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:18,995
Thank you for crying with me.

130
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:23,595
Thanks for understanding how I feel.

131
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:50,795
Goodbye,

132
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,795
my first love.

133
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,245
Tae Hee stayed beside you for a very long time.

134
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,905
(Airport Bus)

135
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,745
You should have a chat with Mom.

136
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,485
Okay.

137
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,055
I'm sorry, Tae Hee.

138
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,095
It's okay.

139
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:04,490
I had no idea that...

140
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:07,205
you couldn't control your heart.

141
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:13,605
But I won't be shaken for a long time.

142
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:16,475
It's not good to be shaken for too long like you did.

143
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,245
Yes.

144
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:21,115
You're much stronger and cooler than me.

145
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:27,550
Anyway, I'm not leaving because of you,

146
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,995
so you have to be well.

147
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:05,695
(From your girlfriend who wants to be a great joy to you.)

148
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:11,520
(You are mine.)

149
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,765
(My boyfriend's photo shoot)

150
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,245
(Let's continue to fill up the album with great memories and pictures.)

151
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:10,995
(5 years later)

152
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,595
Happy birthday,

153
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:16,235
Si Hyun.

154
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:39,655
I hope you're both well,

155
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:42,055
Si Hyun...

156
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,055
and Soo Ji.

157
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,475
Hey.

158
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,400
Why do you always work overtime?

159
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:08,055
You need to go home.

160
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,525
I fell asleep again.

161
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:20,765
Hey.

162
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,590
After you're done with this,

163
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:26,835
we have to decide on the blueprint first.

164
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:28,390
Oh, wait.

165
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:30,330
We need to take another look...

166
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:32,200
at the earthquake-proof blueprint on the building in Paju.

167
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:34,245
Then we'll have to make adjustments.

168
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:36,330
Anyway, why is Hangyeong Industries...

169
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:39,200
suddenly asking us to turn it in three days earlier?

170
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,170
We ran around to get permissions because they were in a hurry,

171
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,985
but they won't answer us about the next payment.

172
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:48,195
Why are people like this?

173
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,695
Tae Hee.

174
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:54,290
One who's more powerful than the creator is a landlord.

175
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,495
And the one who's more powerful than a landlord is a building owner.

176
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,105
Don't you know that?

177
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:01,675
This isn't why I got into architecture.

178
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,560
They started changing their demands so many times,

179
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,100
so I'm starting to get confused.

180
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:07,230
The constructors are...

181
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,400
having a tough time redoing their floor.

182
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:11,285
I mean, it's a huge job.

183
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,740
Darn it, you workaholic.

184
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:17,840
- Get away from me. - Why?

185
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,485
Go away.

186
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:35,975
You look good. Have you been well?

187
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,175
You look a bit worn out.

188
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,275
Congratulations on your promotion.

189
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:46,915
How's work?

190
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,855
It's all right.

191
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,955
You'll be all right. You're a talented guy.

192
00:16:57,553 --> 00:17:00,565
Isn't it time you came back to the business world?

193
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,290
No.

194
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,305
Soo Ji still has a while until she graduates.

195
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,705
I confessed my crime...

196
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:10,505
and paid for what I have done,

197
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,545
but I still feel guilty about what I did.

198
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,275
All right.

199
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:19,645
I like my life now.

200
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:25,025
I have time to look after the most precious things in life.

201
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:30,955
I'm glad to see that you're doing much better.

202
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,795
Let me know whenever you want to come back.

203
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,635
The chairwoman will be happy to have you.

204
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,135
Thanks.

205
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:51,940
We have so much work to do because the exhibition hall is huge.

206
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,145
Gosh, you're so greedy.

207
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,910
- I hope they all get sold out. - Goodness.

208
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:00,280
Your daughter is making money now.

209
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:01,995
I need to get her married.

210
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,465
My goodness.

211
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:09,265
- Ms. Seol, someone sent flowers. - Really?

212
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:14,005
- Thanks. - Sure.

213
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:23,630
I sent them the floor plan for their terrace...

214
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:26,200
and confirmed the new blueprint for their rooftop.

215
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,155
Then I asked if they wanted folding doors for their terrace...

216
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,640
and that they could just decide on the style and the color...

217
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,455
along with some lighting recommendations.

218
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,395
Then they suddenly asked,

219
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:39,120
"Is the terrace a good place to look at constellations?"

220
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,825
That's the only thing they asked...

221
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,865
through an email at 3am.

222
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:50,435
Well, I guess that building owner and I have a connection.

223
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,560
But why do they have to ask me in the middle of the night?

224
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,600
They're probably the idle rich who look at constellations,

225
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,815
then decide to wake up in the middle of the day.

226
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:00,645
They have to be an Aries.

227
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,240
Darn it.

228
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,485
Yes.

229
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,855
They definitely have a connection with you.

230
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:11,250
So make sure you go over for an in-site survey, okay?

231
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:13,095
Why?

232
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,135
Why me?

233
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,305
(Sponsor)

234
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,800
Hello, dear sponsor.

235
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,375
Will you come to my exhibition?

236
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:27,915
Oh, right.

237
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,845
Sorry, I was busy.

238
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,155
Thanks for the flowers. You sent them, right?

239
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,125
Flowers?

240
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,485
Oh, the flowers.

241
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,565
- What's this? - It's for you.

242
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:53,990
This is for me?

243
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:56,105
It could be your soulmate landowner.

244
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,075
No way.

245
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,635
(Cosmos Graduation Concert)

246
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:51,525
Soo Ji.

247
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,895
- Yes? - Someone sent you flowers.

248
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:55,535
Flowers?

249
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,785
Dear...

250
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,125
landowner.

251
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:26,065
As you requested, your terrace...

252
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:28,235
is the perfect spot from which...

253
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:30,365
to view the constellations.

254
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,705
On the first floor, you can hold an exhibition...

255
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:39,205
as well as host small to medium-sized...

256
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,105
chamber music performances.

257
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:43,615
Are you an Aries?

258
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:45,485
Why in the middle of the night...

259
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:50,585
Is that too casual?

260
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:56,855
I'll see you the day after tomorrow when the building's completed.

261
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:12,945
It's late, but happy birthday, Si Hyun.

262
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:16,875
What do you wish for now?

263
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:19,685
I've been...

264
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,485
wishing for the same thing for the last few years.

265
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:56,315
I think you've had enough.

266
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:59,585
I'm in no mood to do business today.

267
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:02,925
That's just cruel.

268
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,165
I'll listen to the cello with you. Can you let me stay?

269
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:12,935
No. It's very windy.

270
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:16,935
On days like this, I want to get drunk on cognac.

271
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,865
Your boss is thinking of his first love again.

272
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,965
What a pity.

273
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,075
Cello music in a Japanese bar is just pitiful.

274
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:04,785
We're closed for the day.

275
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:35,515
I think...

276
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,325
Si Hyun sent your address.

277
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,625
Welcome, Soo Ji.

278
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,405
There are paintings.

279
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,115
Good lighting and ventilation.

280
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:37,975
I'm good.

281
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:05,425
It's been a while, Eun Tae Hee.

282
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:07,765
Kwon Si Hyun.

283
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,665
I knew it was you.

284
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:16,105
It had to be.

285
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,705
Of course, it had to be me.

286
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,315
You could've shown up sooner.

287
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:24,845
Not until anything we say...

288
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,585
can hurt each other.

289
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:30,355
Haven't I grown up?

290
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,535
It's nice to see you,

291
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:45,065
Eun Tae Hee.

292
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,715
(Thank you for watching Tempted.)

293
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,415
(Tempted)

294
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,565
(Thank you for watching Tempted.)
