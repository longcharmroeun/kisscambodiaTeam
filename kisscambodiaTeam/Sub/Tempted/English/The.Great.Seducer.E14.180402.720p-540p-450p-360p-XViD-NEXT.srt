00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,445
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,380
(Myoungjeong Hospital)

3
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,903
Hey, I should be there for you, but I'm too busy with work.

4
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:36,239
It's okay. We can take care of this.

5
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,540
Okay.

6
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,609
Take care of yourself.

7
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,712
If you feel any worse, call President Myung, okay?

8
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:44,748
- Si Hyun. - Yes.

9
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,984
Yes, don't worry.

10
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:58,561
(Credit Card Declined)

11
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:09,739
It's probably because your dad is a bit mad right now.

12
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,344
Hey, brighten up.

13
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:16,379
You can just do better next time.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,216
Thanks. And thanks for paying my bills.

15
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:23,720
What would I have done without you?

16
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:27,957
Don't worry. I'm paying my rent with that.

17
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:31,328
Let's apply the interest retroactively with the rent.

18
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:33,129
Retroactively?

19
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:39,569
Why are you suddenly getting glasses?

20
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:43,239
I'm going to start studying seriously.

21
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:45,775
I'll get a pair prettier than my brother's.

22
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,844
I don't like your brother.

23
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:51,948
Don't be so harsh on him. He's a little sick.

24
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,650
He's sick?

25
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,185
Where?

26
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:56,619
His heart.

27
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:59,122
That's why he didn't go to school.

28
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:03,893
- Is that why you homeschooled? - Yes.

29
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:05,295
Mr. Kwon Seok Woo?

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,235
Who is it?

31
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,738
My mom's new husband.

32
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,975
My eyesight seems fine,

33
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:22,045
but I've been having problems with glare.

34
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,316
We don't know the reason behind this symptom, so it's hard to say.

35
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,719
But it will be quite difficult to stop you from going blind.

36
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:35,959
(Young Won)

37
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,330
Let's both live our lives, then see each other once in a while...

38
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:41,998
when we miss each other to death.

39
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:45,335
But I'm sure we won't have to do that.

40
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,838
We've lived well until this day.

41
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,007
Let me just see you...

42
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,410
until the day I can.

43
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:55,779
Bye.

44
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,575
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

45
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,278
- Should we go back to the hospital? - No, it's okay.

46
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:38,254
I can draw that again.

47
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:41,191
Today is our real first day. Okay?

48
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:46,329
You need to get some rest. Go to bed.

49
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,431
Bed?

50
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,035
Will you be okay?

51
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,138
I'm a beast in bed.

52
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:59,042
- Give me some food. - Here.

53
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,611
I'm sleepy now. Goodnight.

54
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:03,480
Water.

55
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,417
- I need to use the bathroom. - You need help there too?

56
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:12,922
Gosh, you're so heavy.

57
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:14,991
- Oh, my head. - I'm sorry.

58
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:18,228
- I'm so sorry. - Pet me. Hurry.

59
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:23,066
Good boy. Who's a good boy?

60
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,670
I'm hungry.

61
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:02,505
We used to be able to get together without making plans.

62
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,380
Aren't you coming to our hideout?

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,782
Si Hyun got discharged. What are you doing?

64
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:14,717
See you tonight.

65
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:16,653
(Best Pork Skin, See you tonight.)

66
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,755
Gosh, stop making me go out.

67
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,659
Okay, I'll see you there.

68
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:35,038
(Best Pork Skin)

69
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,907
- All right. - Bottoms up.

70
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,444
- Isn't it good? - Soo Ji, over here.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,782
What's going on?

72
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:47,917
Se Joo's business opened today.

73
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:49,319
What?

74
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,588
We'll take more premium pork skin.

75
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:52,889
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,391
He bought out the restaurant.

77
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,727
He was going to get kicked out if he didn't make any money.

78
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:58,861
Cheers.

79
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,198
It's right in front of your school, so come often.

80
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:05,001
I added pork skin with rice as a lunch menu.

81
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,704
You really need some pork skin.

82
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:09,505
Your skin looks so dry.

83
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,374
You usually have such soft skin.

84
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,343
Here comes Mr. Grills.

85
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,078
Three pieces for you. Have some.

86
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:17,180
Don't give me old meat.

87
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:20,083
Can I have some to go? I want to have some at home.

88
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,018
You don't have to do that. Just have mine.

89
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:26,222
You must have a dog. A cute, little dog.

90
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:29,759
Si Hyun, don't be so cheap. Come here and pay for your food.

91
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:31,527
My dad cut off my credit card.

92
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:34,230
Did he find out that you were hospitalized?

93
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,100
That's probably why he cut it off. So give me some meat, okay?

94
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,469
Darn it.

95
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:44,841
I'll come here every day for lunch.

96
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:50,780
You wanted some to go to have it with Tae Hee, right?

97
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:52,348
Yes, you're right.

98
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:57,353
I know what you two did that night.

99
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,721
Really?

100
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,757
- Goodbye. - Thanks for the food.

101
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,225
- Bye. - See you.

102
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:07,630
They're having so much fun.

103
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:18,007
- Yes? - You called.

104
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:21,144
Did you tell Mr. Kwon that Si Hyun was hospitalized?

105
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,414
I asked you not to, didn't I?

106
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:27,050
This is why I'm against the idea.

107
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:30,286
This is how you'll treat Si Hyun once you're married.

108
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,356
Ko Kyung Joo, can you do me a favor?

109
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,128
For a while, don't tell Soo Ji or Se Joo that I'm seeing Tae Hee.

110
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:40,596
Okay.

111
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:43,266
You've finally come to your senses.

112
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:46,169
- About what? - Your future step-sister.

113
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,204
She's acting like a sister-in-law to Tae Hee.

114
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:49,872
A sister-in-law?

115
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:51,574
Si Hyun.

116
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,544
I used to really hate your guts, you know.

117
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:57,180
Did you have to put that so harshly?

118
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:59,982
But I kind of like you now.

119
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:01,784
Why?

120
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:04,654
- I wonder why. - I just do.

121
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,725
Yes, we didn't drink yet.

122
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:22,905
This is what we're up to. I took that just for you.

123
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:24,107
What's this?

124
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,679
Did your dad scold you a lot?

125
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,948
Why would he? We don't talk to each other.

126
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,016
I bet it was my mom.

127
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,551
Sorry.

128
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:37,920
There's no way Dad didn't know.

129
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:40,656
I told you before.

130
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:44,727
Don't apologize for your mom, okay?

131
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:50,266
Do you still hate me?

132
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,072
There's no way you'd forget...

133
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,608
what I told Tae Hee.

134
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,812
I thought about something while you were sick.

135
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,248
Our plot.

136
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:09,185
Our scheme. Was it all for nothing?

137
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,456
The adults might not bat an eyelid,

138
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,858
and we just squirmed for nothing.

139
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,028
The real me would be...

140
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,764
looking for worse ways to get back at them.

141
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,836
I couldn't do that, knowing you were hospitalized.

142
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:30,006
I felt like you were sick because of me.

143
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,240
I wasn't.

144
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,978
- Nice. - It's great.

145
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:37,446
Were you enjoying yourselves?

146
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:38,915
It's delicious.

147
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,018
Is he running a business or creating a playground?

148
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:45,321
- He bought the place to feed you. - Do you believe that?

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,361
It's raining.

150
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:55,998
Spring rain.

151
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,671
When the weather's warmer,

152
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,208
shall we go on a trip?

153
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:06,375
Sure.

154
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:07,944
Just us three.

155
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:10,313
Let's have fun like we did before.

156
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:20,323
Kwon Si Hyun.

157
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,330
Si Hyun, are you asleep?

158
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,367
I'm coming in.

159
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,743
I knew it.

160
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,681
Wake up. We have to go somewhere.

161
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,783
I want to sleep. I have nowhere to go.

162
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:50,586
The sun's up high, so get up.

163
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:54,390
What are you doing? You're like an animal.

164
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,860
I can't let you off today.

165
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,529
- Get up. - Why? It's too early.

166
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,032
- Come along. - Why are we here?

167
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,302
Here's the artist.

168
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:07,470
Just a moment.

169
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,905
What's going on?

170
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:11,841
They needed someone to draw, so I recommended you.

171
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,609
I can't do that.

172
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,344
No. You can.

173
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,581
I like your drawings.

174
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:20,483
Gosh.

175
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:24,253
Do your best. See you at home later.

176
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:29,692
At home?

177
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:31,794
(6th Grade Math)

178
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:34,964
This ginseng latte will improve your brain function.

179
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:39,702
Hye Jeong, you're just brilliant.

180
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,839
No one can bust through a grade a week like you do.

181
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,907
Mom.

182
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:46,709
I'm going to go to a university.

183
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,379
Yes. Yes, you must.

184
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,481
That's why...

185
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,617
I should check out a campus.

186
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:57,286
I might want to study harder after that.

187
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,822
Where should we go? Ewha? Sookmyung?

188
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:02,558
Driver Choi! Get the car right now!

189
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:03,960
No, Mom.

190
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,362
Some friends offered to show me around.

191
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:09,365
You should rest. You do so much for me.

192
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,901
My dear Hye Jeong.

193
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:14,804
Just go to any women's university,

194
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:17,506
and I won't have to eat ever again.

195
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:20,576
Are they spam messages?

196
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,312
They're codes from the pager era.

197
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,847
- Are they? - Yes.

198
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:26,983
Who would send these?

199
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,652
It must be that Kwon fool.

200
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:31,120
Don't you have his number?

201
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,155
I didn't save it.

202
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:37,727
1004. "Angel"?

203
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:39,228
He's crazy.

204
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,330
Look.

205
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:44,033
125 means "Come here."

206
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,203
1414. He wants to eat with you.

207
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,471
"Quickly, quickly".

208
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:51,407
2222 means he's grumbling.

209
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,442
Because you're not getting it.

210
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:57,179
How should I respond to this?

211
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:59,348
Why would you respond? Are you crazy?

212
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,017
Give me that.

213
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:17,566
- What are you doing? - Gathering evidence.

214
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,635
Hey.

215
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,038
What are you doing?

216
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:23,639
Gathering evidence.

217
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:25,641
That's your mom.

218
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,977
How are you?

219
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,285
It's been a while, Kyung Joo.

220
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:39,455
- Do you like the campus life? - Yes, I love it.

221
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:45,294
Tae Hee, I'm meeting Se Joo.

222
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:48,297
- See you around. - Hey, you said we'd have lunch.

223
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:50,566
Go if you want. I won't stop you.

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,502
You're both so stiff.

225
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,305
Come with me, then.

226
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,942
- I'll buy you something delicious. - Thanks, professor.

227
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:02,645
I'm not coming to eat with you.

228
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:06,315
- I want to eat with Auntie. - Stop it. Let's go.

229
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,820
Come along. What shall we eat?

230
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,289
Soo Ji.

231
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:17,927
- Did you get the call too? - Yes.

232
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:22,565
Who's that walking next to Tae Hee?

233
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:25,468
That's Tae Hee's mom. Don't they look alike?

234
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:26,936
Let's go.

235
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:39,281
Here. Will that be enough?

236
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:42,184
Thank you, ladies. And Se Joo.

237
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,820
Thanks to you, I'm going on my first date.

238
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,922
That is also my pleasure.

239
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:48,190
Get going.

240
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,326
If your mom calls, I'll make something up.

241
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:54,897
Thank you. I won't forget what you did for me. Bye.

242
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,432
Have fun.

243
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,367
Get home on time.

244
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:00,302
Is she that pleased?

245
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:03,472
Why wouldn't she be? You should find a boyfriend soon.

246
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,840
She will.

247
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:08,477
Soo Ji, are your lectures over? I'll buy you something tasty.

248
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:12,314
Go run your restaurant. You didn't make enough to treat me.

249
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:13,782
Fine.

250
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:17,052
Kyung Joo, you're up. What shall we eat?

251
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,489
Soo Ji, I have to go.

252
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,405
- Honey. - Darling.

253
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,074
I missed you so much.

254
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:40,376
Me too.

255
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,045
Oh, right.

256
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:47,516
Meet my younger sibling, Turtle.

257
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,620
Turtle is my best friend.

258
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:54,190
Would you mind dating me?

259
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,426
Meet my friend, Anna. Igu-Anna.

260
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,761
She's my roommate.

261
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:01,130
That's so cute.

262
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:03,732
- Don't you think it's destiny? - It is.

263
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,304
The weather's so nice. How about we go on a picnic?

264
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:10,806
I'd love that. Let's eat out.

265
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,978
"Love you passionately"?

266
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,917
Aunt. What's she up to?

267
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:23,819
I don't know.

268
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,824
I miss you.

269
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,297
What do you want to eat?

270
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,366
- Anything. - Did we drag you out...

271
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,034
when you'd rather be with a boy?

272
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:42,671
I don't have a boyfriend.

273
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,206
You should.

274
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:46,842
You should date so your mom can.

275
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:49,445
A perfect man like your dad's great,

276
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:52,248
but I'd like your mom to date a younger man this time.

277
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:56,552
Someone 10 years younger who is dreadfully handsome.

278
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,622
Are you seeing someone?

279
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:03,759
No. I was just saying.

280
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,829
Why?

281
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,998
Am I not allowed to see someone?

282
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,867
Said who?

283
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,938
You're a born seductress. I can't stop you.

284
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:18,674
I feel sorry for Dad who's all alone.

285
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:19,808
Tae Hee.

286
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:25,014
Geum Sil, I'll go home.

287
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,715
You can eat with Tae Hee.

288
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,853
Young Won. Hey.

289
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,247
Seol Young Won?

290
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:02,618
Should the pathetic two grab a drink together?

291
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,544
You're here early.

292
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,948
You should smile when you walk.

293
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:36,418
I trained for too long to get this strut.

294
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:37,853
I'll do that, ma'am.

295
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:42,658
What?

296
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:46,662
I thought you asked me to arrange a math teacher.

297
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,397
He's on his way right now.

298
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:52,201
That's not what I meant when I asked you to arrange a meeting.

299
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,603
I shouldn't have dressed up.

300
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:00,042
Ma'am.

301
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:04,246
Yes, you did help me out quite a lot.

302
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:07,383
Thanks to you, Kyung Joo had an easy time at school.

303
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,886
But Kyung Joo got into college,

304
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:15,557
and above all, I don't meet with my junior boys anymore.

305
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,993
Stop bothering me.

306
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:20,629
Fine.

307
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:24,600
You don't need me because Kyung Joo is done with school.

308
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:29,338
I thought we were going to look for someone for Kyung Joo to marry too.

309
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,840
I'll forget about that too.

310
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,310
Thanks for setting me up with a math teacher.

311
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,346
Can I ask him to come visit us at home?

312
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,948
I don't think we have anything else to discuss.

313
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:41,350
Ma'am.

314
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,054
(Mom)

315
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,460
Hello, this is Soo Ji.

316
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:54,463
Hye Jeong went to the restroom.

317
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:56,298
Yes.

318
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:57,866
Okay.

319
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,040
Hye Jeong, where are you?

320
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,543
- It's for you. - Why?

321
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:11,213
You need to be home in 30 minutes. You have to meet the new math tutor.

322
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,781
I'm in Gyeonggi Province right now.

323
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:24,359
- Yes? - Kyung Joo, I need your help!

324
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:26,728
What?

325
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,467
Oh, my gosh.

326
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:37,706
Mom, you need to stall Ms. Jo. At least an hour.

327
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:39,641
What can I do?

328
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,344
Ma'am.

329
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:46,448
Hye Jeong will need some more time...

330
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:48,517
to come home.

331
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:51,286
Should we talk a little more?

332
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:53,155
We have nothing to discuss.

333
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:55,591
I'm going to read at home.

334
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,926
Well, this is...

335
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:02,731
about the arrangement which you asked for.

336
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,004
- Let's meet again. - Okay.

337
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,240
Goodbye.

338
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:14,309
Joo An!

339
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,647
Joo An.

340
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:22,251
Do you want to go sing with some of your friends?

341
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,953
Okay, if you ask.

342
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:27,022
I just have to go sing and have fun, right?

343
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:31,827
Yes, you'll be her chorus for about four hours.

344
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,362
Keep it up.

345
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:39,268
The river flows under the Third Hanggang Bridge

346
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:41,703
Is she a singer?

347
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,874
No, she is actually a certified teacher.

348
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,075
Isn't she amazing?

349
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:49,011
She's a great singer.

350
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:52,114
Gosh, you're so adorable.

351
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,849
And you sing so well too.

352
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,150
Thank you.

353
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:58,487
Geun Sook, what are you doing? Get over here.

354
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,088
Of course.

355
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,160
You know that I adore you, right?

356
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:09,798
Why did you try to be so smart against me?

357
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:14,202
How about it? Are you ready to party through the night?

358
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,637
- Yes! - Yes!

359
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,875
Under the bridge

360
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:37,993
I'm done with the mural. See you at home.

361
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,763
Okay. I'll be doing homework.

362
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:50,706
She's Tae Hee's mom?

363
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,344
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.

364
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:06,788
Are you going home?

365
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:08,924
What? Why are you here?

366
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:12,227
I was just painting a bit.

367
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:14,930
It's been forever.

368
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:18,300
You go to school, and Se Joo works. I can't just sit around.

369
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,501
You can.

370
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,637
Oh, okay.

371
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:25,440
Can you drop me off at the hospital?

372
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,511
Let's go.

373
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,690
- Are you feeling okay? - Yes.

374
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:45,694
It'll only take a minute. Let's go grab dinner.

375
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:47,095
You don't have plans, right?

376
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:50,332
You should eat dinner with President Myung from time to time.

377
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,768
You must've gotten angry at her because of me.

378
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,906
I need to check her schedule to eat dinner with her.

379
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:04,212
Dismiss the president who threatens public health.

380
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:06,014
- Dismiss, dismiss! - One second.

381
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:09,418
We are against corporatization of Myoungjeong Hospital.

382
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:12,854
We are against corporatization of Myoungjeong Hospital.

383
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:14,856
- We are against it! - We are against it!

384
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:18,026
Dismiss the president who threatens public health.

385
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:21,363
We are against corporatization of Myoungjeong Hospital.

386
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:23,365
- We are against it! - We are against it!

387
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,833
There's the president!

388
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,969
- Get her. - Get the president.

389
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:30,505
- Resign! - Resign!

390
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:32,274
- Resign! - Resign!

391
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:34,609
She'll be sadder if she sees you here.

392
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:36,144
Wait.

393
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:37,379
Let's go.

394
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,047
Get in the car.

395
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:40,982
Soo Ji, come on.

396
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:43,585
- Resign! - Resign!

397
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:44,786
Let's go inside.

398
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,221
I'm fine.

399
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,556
Let's go inside for now.

400
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:54,796
Let's go register our marriage. Let's do it right now!

401
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,932
- What? - Let's get married tomorrow.

402
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:00,335
I can't let my mom marry your dad. This is too dirty and cheap.

403
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:03,238
He'll use my mom like that once they get married.

404
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:05,173
Don't get all worked up.

405
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:09,478
What's your dad doing, using Myung Mi Ri as his shield?

406
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:11,313
This is the worst.

407
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:12,514
Hey.

408
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,016
Does that offend you?

409
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:17,052
Let's get married.

410
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:20,856
Why? Are you afraid you'll do that to me?

411
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:24,826
Will you use me like your dad uses my mom? No.

412
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,496
You don't care about business.

413
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:29,798
You're going to live freely just as you do now.

414
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,234
I'm willing to marry you. Say something.

415
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,605
I'll give you what you want without any conditions.

416
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,673
I don't want it.

417
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,144
What?

418
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,481
I don't want that anymore.

419
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,552
Right.

420
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,921
This is how you are.

421
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,792
You always try to stay out, pretending like you don't care.

422
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:58,193
Am I wrong?

423
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:02,330
You gave up on the bet without telling me, didn't you?

424
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,235
I'm sick of this.

425
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:11,139
I'm sick of your selfishness and your dad.

426
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:16,545
Soo Ji.

427
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:21,183
Stop using our friendship as a weapon.

428
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:26,421
If you do this again,

429
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,526
I'm not sure if I can hold onto you again.

430
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:36,031
Your father is seeing someone else.

431
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,838
Your dad is seeing another woman.

432
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:46,775
Where did you see this? How did you see him?

433
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:48,476
- At... - Who is it?

434
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,435
(Tempted)

435
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:16,671
I'll find out about the woman you're seeing.

436
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,373
Don't do anything rash.

437
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:20,876
Maybe you have another kid out of wedlock with her.

438
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:22,110
Nothing's up.

439
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,079
You can tell me anything.

440
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,380
I'm fine.

441
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:28,917
How did you know my dad's seeing someone else?

442
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:29,951
I need to know.

443
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:31,987
No, I've never had makgeolli before.

444
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,154
It's really tasty.

445
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:36,691
Hey, I don't think we can leave. We should spend the night.

446
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:37,859
You animal.

447
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,027
Hey.
