1
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:09,845
And you hit Tae Hee.

2
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:12,615
If you have a sense of conscience, you should stop here.

3
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,355
I won't tell my father or Soo Ji.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,825
Soo Ji...

5
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:18,855
won't be able to handle it.

6
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:46,885
Soo Ji, I hope you're not having a hard time sleeping.

7
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,525
A glass of cognac helps when you can't fall asleep.

8
00:00:55,495 --> 00:01:00,465
Try saying my name and get some sleep. Okay?

9
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,935
Okay.

10
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,815
Do you have something to say to me?

11
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,385
No.

12
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,785
You don't have to come here.

13
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:31,525
When Mom was hospitalized, she hated being alone.

14
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:35,525
I understood why after I stayed at the hospital for a few days.

15
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm coming so that I'd feel better about myself, so don't worry.

16
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:44,505
If it makes you uncomfortable, I won't come.

17
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:47,305
No, it's not like that.

18
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,545
Once you get surgery,

19
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,845
I'm going to go abroad with Grandma.

20
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:55,645
I told her too.

21
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,155
I'm going to look for...

22
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:00,085
what I like.

23
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:04,425
What I like and can do.

24
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:07,925
Okay.

25
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:11,565
Aren't you going to say anything?

26
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:17,475
Take your time, and make sure you don't regret your decision.

27
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:21,905
Looking back, I don't think I was able to do that.

28
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,215
When it comes to work...

29
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:26,075
and people.

30
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:35,280
Joo An, I'm being forced to go to a birthday party by my parents.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,855
I hate this.

32
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,695
I miss you, Hye Jeong.

33
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:45,635
Is everything okay at home?

34
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:52,375
Gosh, why is this taking so long?

35
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,885
- Gosh, stop it. - "Gosh"?

36
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,655
I'm not your brother-in-law yet. Stop being impolite.

37
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:11,125
Stop picking on me again.

38
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:14,790
I'm doing this for you.

39
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,520
I turned it off so that you would stop playing games.

40
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,360
You play games all day, so you have poor vision and get fat.

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,630
You're violent and anti-social too. Don't you know?

42
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,635
Who are you calling violent?

43
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,175
Do you want me to be honest?

44
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,630
I'm going to be your brother-in-law.

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,645
And... And this is my house too.

46
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:34,985
This punk.

47
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:37,355
This won't do. You have to get punished.

48
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,285
- Don't move. - Wait.

49
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,250
- Hey. - That hurts.

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,095
You think I'm your friend?

51
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:46,580
I told you.

52
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,665
I said I'd kill you if you touched my brother again.

53
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:54,405
Did you just hit me? What did you say to me?

54
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:58,900
These idiots. I was being too nice to you.

55
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,275
- Hey. - What?

56
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,740
- Goodness. - You're so weak.

57
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,170
Gosh. Hey.

58
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,970
Hey.

59
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,340
- Hit him. Do it. - Don't even try.

60
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,985
- Hey, don't do it. - Go ahead.

61
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,180
That was nothing.

62
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,995
- Do it again. - There.

63
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:18,720
Watch and see.

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,920
Once we get married, I'm going to train you properly.

65
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Whatever. Watch what?

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,060
Watch now.

67
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,460
- Fine, watch. - Okay.

68
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,935
- Watch now. - Stop.

69
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:32,830
Watch this.

70
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,830
Hey.

71
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,940
- Kyu Jeong. - Let go.

72
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,145
Hye Jeong.

73
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,545
Mom.

74
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,855
Ki Young, I'll talk to your parents...

75
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:49,985
about what happened today.

76
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:55,325
Madam.

77
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:58,895
I know the parents will decide whether to call off this wedding,

78
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:02,505
but did you know? Hye Jeong has a boyfriend.

79
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:04,635
What did you say?

80
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:06,235
I mean,

81
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:09,070
it's okay if she doesn't get engaged to me,

82
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,875
but she's naive, so make sure you protect her. Okay?

83
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:16,145
I'm telling you this because I've known you for years.

84
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:20,110
Whom is Hye Jeong seeing?

85
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,485
I don't know.

86
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:25,095
I told you about how she's been hanging around with Soo Ji.

87
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,475
Dad.

88
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:41,905
Tae Hee.

89
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:51,280
It looks so different from when I lectured here.

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,255
I wish I could go to school with you.

91
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,785
It'd be great if you went back to lecturing again.

92
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,025
Show me that guy first.

93
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:00,925
Where is he?

94
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,565
I came here to see him.

95
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,195
What?

96
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,835
The guy who popped in when we were video chatting.

97
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,635
Is he in the same major?

98
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,505
We already broke up.

99
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,345
Why?

100
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,345
Did he not like you anymore?

101
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:18,915
That's not it.

102
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,545
Then why did you break up?

103
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,615
If that's not the reason, what's the problem?

104
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:28,325
It wasn't because we didn't like each other.

105
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,095
I don't know. It didn't work out.

106
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:36,395
If you both like each other, you should keep seeing him.

107
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:39,095
For two people to love each other at the same time...

108
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,505
is a huge miracle.

109
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:45,635
That miracle doesn't last forever. I don't like it.

110
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,805
It doesn't last forever,

111
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,615
but the time and the feelings...

112
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:53,015
are so joyful and precious.

113
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:56,285
Wasn't it like that for you?

114
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,985
You were so lonely because of Mom,

115
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:02,685
but do you still believe in love?

116
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:04,055
Of course.

117
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,395
I believe in love.

118
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:09,295
You shouldn't make fun of one-sided love.

119
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,890
Your mom didn't love me...

120
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,360
as much as I wanted her to,

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,405
but she let me love her...

122
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,135
as much as I wanted.

123
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,475
So that's enough for me.

124
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,940
I didn't win her heart completely,

125
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,945
but it fulfilled my heart.

126
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,925
If there's somebody you like, love them and be loved all you want.

127
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,750
I know you got hurt because of your mom and me,

128
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,190
and I know you don't believe in love because of that.

129
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,835
But if you can't break free from that,

130
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:21,005
I'll feel bad all the time.

131
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:44,925
Nothing happened to me.

132
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:50,465
I just wanted to give you a hug.

133
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,765
It's nice getting hugged by you.

134
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,235
Tae Hee.

135
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,975
Eun Tae Hee.

136
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:07,585
Why?

137
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:13,855
This is a miracle.

138
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,425
You called me.

139
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,195
You really came.

140
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,165
Say it. Why did you call me?

141
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,605
Okay, I'm going to say what's on my mind.

142
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:32,605
Can you spend tomorrow with me?

143
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:33,975
Just one day.

144
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,145
Why? Are you going somewhere?

145
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:44,315
Just one day.

146
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,225
Okay.

147
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,965
- Really? - I will.

148
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,895
I'll see you tomorrow then.

149
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,265
Okay.

150
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,975
- You should've woken me up. - Are you feeling better?

151
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,075
You slept for so long for once.

152
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,545
Just because.

153
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,515
Mom.

154
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:53,985
Should I go study abroad?

155
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:56,855
All of a sudden?

156
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,955
I want to get a hold of myself and just play cello for a few years.

157
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,095
Do you want to go with me?

158
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,795
What do you think about...

159
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:09,105
leaving with me and taking a few years off from work?

160
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:11,835
I have to work.

161
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,875
If you want to go, you can. I'll help you get ready.

162
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:18,975
But...

163
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,170
both of you never wanted to go,

164
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,545
but Si Hyun and you both want to go abroad now.

165
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,255
Is Si Hyun moving abroad too?

166
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,855
It seems so.

167
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,425
They're looking into it.

168
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,295
If you don't want to go, you don't have to. You can stay.

169
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,895
No.

170
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,735
I thought of this myself apart from Si Hyun.

171
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:47,370
If you're worried about Mr. Kwon,

172
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,145
we can wait until he gets better.

173
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,145
Come with me.

174
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,445
Let's take our time and think about it.

175
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,295
Get some rest.

176
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:14,865
(One sunny day, Tae Hee loves Si Hyun)

177
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:20,330
Let's fill up this album with great memories...

178
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,875
and cute pictures.

179
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,425
Hey, I'm here.

180
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,265
What are we doing?

181
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:44,595
Here.

182
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,175
What did you want to do? Why are we here?

183
00:13:58,815 --> 00:13:59,945
One second.

184
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:12,295
- What's this? - What do you think? Flowers.

185
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,995
Take this.

186
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,095
Let's take pictures.

187
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,895
When did you prepare these?

188
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:23,235
Tae Hee, hurry.

189
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:24,760
What?

190
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,645
The only thing that's left of your memories are pictures.

191
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,045
Okay.

192
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,970
What if you end up not going anywhere after all this?

193
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,885
You promised to spend a day with me.

194
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,285
There it goes. 1, 2.

195
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,295
I can't tell which one is the flower.

196
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:52,635
1, 2, 3.

197
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,570
There are no other customers here.

198
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,005
I borrowed this place out to be alone with you.

199
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,175
Are you insane?

200
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:07,915
These are all expensive, right?

201
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,985
I'm joking.

202
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:12,715
They only take one reservation per night.

203
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:17,225
I looked for a place where we could be alone.

204
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:20,255
You prepared a lot.

205
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:23,265
Would you like a glass of wine, my lady?

206
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,395
Cheers.

207
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,530
Lately when I wake up in the morning,

208
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,500
the first thing that's on my mind is that you are...

209
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,005
not too far away from me.

210
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,575
But there will come a morning when the first thing on my mind is...

211
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:42,745
that you are far away from me.

212
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:44,785
There will also come a day...

213
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,825
when all I think about is that I have...

214
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,425
deceived you.

215
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,825
Even when such day comes,

216
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,195
I pray every single day...

217
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:59,295
that I will still remember your smile.

218
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,515
(Eun Tae Hee)

219
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,025
We did so much stuff together.

220
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:39,205
- What's her name again? - Eun Tae Hee. Stop forgetting.

221
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:57,090
What?

222
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:59,995
Soo Ji, what do you say to a midnight walk in Seoul?

223
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:02,090
Out of the blue?

224
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:05,095
I want to see you right now. I won't annoy you.

225
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,865
I'm coming to your house.

226
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:25,385
Take this.

227
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,825
I'll hold onto you every single day.

228
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:36,065
Se Joo.

229
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,765
I thought we would never change.

230
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,475
When did everything begin to go wrong,

231
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,205
and since when have I done so much wrong?

232
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,915
If I had told him that I liked him first...

233
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:58,855
When he asked me why I didn't trust anyone,

234
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:02,150
if I had told him that I trusted him,

235
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,955
would we have come down to this?

236
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:06,555
I wanted to make sure that...

237
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,425
no one changed.

238
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,595
Nothing went wrong.

239
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,765
It's just that...

240
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:18,305
we changed a little.

241
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,615
Se Joo, what would I have done without you?

242
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:28,845
I'm so glad you're here.

243
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,785
All of a sudden?

244
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,455
It looks like Si Hyun is going abroad.

245
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,095
My mom told me.

246
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,195
I'm going to leave too.

247
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:48,230
I'm persuading my mom to leave everything to come with me.

248
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,765
Why? Where to?

249
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,535
Why would you leave?

250
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:55,145
You and Si Hyun can't do this. Why are you all leaving?

251
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,545
Okay, we were jerks,

252
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:03,510
but it's nothing that should've made you two split up...

253
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,115
or should have broken us apart.

254
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,695
I shouldn't have begun anything.

255
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,555
It's not your fault.

256
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,365
Soo Ji.

257
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,525
I'll fix everything.

258
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:20,435
Just stay right there, and don't be shaken.

259
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:28,775
Come in.

260
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,410
Hye Jeong.

261
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:31,875
Be honest.

262
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,375
Are you dating someone?

263
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,345
It's not a crime to have a boyfriend.

264
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,910
- Don't treat me like a criminal. - It's a crime!

265
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,580
Why? I just want to be happy.

266
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,280
Is it more important for me to be happy...

267
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,620
or for me to marry Ki Young?

268
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,090
I never said I wanted to get married.

269
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,050
Hye Jeong. Stop talking back to Mom!

270
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,160
Shut up, you idiot.

271
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:55,930
Why did you sit around when Ki Young hit you?

272
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,305
What? You...

273
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:01,410
Quiet, both of you. Whom are you seeing?

274
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,975
Who is this guy?

275
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,040
First of all, you're grounded.

276
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,315
Okay?

277
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:08,840
Mom.

278
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,880
You saw him hit Kyu Jeong and me.

279
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,180
He's not even a human being.

280
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,855
But he's Seowon's son. Seowon Law Firm.

281
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:20,595
Do you not know how scary rumors are?

282
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:22,925
My goodness.

283
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:27,735
Darn you. Mom.

284
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,770
To Kyu Jeong, if you starve Turtle,

285
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,285
I'm going to kill you when I return.

286
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,795
Why is it suddenly raining?

287
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,535
You should take that off now.

288
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:06,305
Oh, this?

289
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,375
Cherry blossoms have all faded.

290
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,515
We'll see lilacs soon.

291
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:16,215
Then it'll be roses.

292
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,015
Flowers will keep on blooming.

293
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:25,425
- You know the seasons? - Of course.

294
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:33,095
Everything will be back to normal when tomorrow comes, right?

295
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:39,605
Then...

296
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,440
give me a day too.

297
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:46,145
It doesn't have to be tomorrow. Give me one of your days too.

298
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:52,555
I can give you 1 day or even 10 days.

299
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,185
But there's something I must tell you beforehand.

300
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:03,795
Ring the bell when you're ready. I'll tell you then.

301
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,535
Okay.

302
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,405
(To my hidden joy, Tae Hee)

303
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:22,615
I have no idea how I should begin,

304
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:24,715
but...

305
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:29,725
I must tell you about the huge mistake I made to you.

306
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:50,705
What brings you here?

307
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,515
I can go in, right?

308
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:07,055
I cleaned out our hideout.

309
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:09,495
Okay.

310
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:13,635
Let me ask you one last time.

311
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,665
Forget about the three of us.

312
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,605
Will you not go back to Soo Ji?

313
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:27,215
Si Hyun.

314
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:31,345
Her face used to only brighten up when she talked about you.

315
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,590
But one day, she looked sad whenever she talked about you.

316
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,695
You should've let her liked you as much as she wanted,

317
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:41,725
then liked her back as much as she liked you.

318
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:44,660
When she got bored and left you,

319
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,835
that's when you should've moved onto Tae Hee.

320
00:23:48,105 --> 00:23:49,365
If you did that,

321
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,535
we wouldn't be like this today.

322
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:54,605
Se Joo.

323
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:59,015
I left that place. You know that.

324
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,670
You can take care of Soo Ji.

325
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,915
I can't do that because of you.

326
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:08,250
I can't help it because she's all I care about.

327
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:10,485
Are you and Soo Ji going to leave like this?

328
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:13,395
Was I the only 1 who wanted to hold us 3 together?

329
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:16,290
Fine.

330
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:18,995
I don't care if that's the case. You need to go back to Soo Ji.

331
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:21,090
Just like how you played her,

332
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,235
you need to stay with her until she tells you to get lost.

333
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:29,375
I'm sorry, Se Joo.

334
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:42,655
I'm...

335
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:44,955
sorry too.

336
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:28,705
- Hello? - This is Se Joo.

337
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:32,175
I need to talk to you about Si Hyun.

338
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:34,605
What is it?

339
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:38,045
I'm in front of Si Hyun's place. Can you come downstairs?

340
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:41,045
Why?

341
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:43,485
We had a fight on his birthday, right?

342
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:46,855
You're the only one who can help us make up.

343
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:04,235
It's been a while.

344
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:07,175
Do you want me to pass something onto him?

345
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:09,770
I have to tell you something about Si Hyun.

346
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,975
If it's something about him, I'll hear it from him.

347
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:14,945
He deceived you.

348
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:20,415
He fooled you.

349
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:26,725
- I'll hear that from him too. - I don't know.

350
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,525
You can either listen to his lies...

351
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:32,695
or look at the evidence that I'll show you.

352
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:45,915
Did she fall asleep?

353
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:01,865
Do you want to go in?

354
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:05,435
No.

355
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,065
Really?

356
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,225
This is our hideout.

357
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:38,935
Our broken nest.

358
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:45,805
Have a seat.

359
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:59,210
Take a look and see how you ended up in our nest.

360
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,580
(Name: Eun Tae Hee, Gender: Female, Birthday...)

361
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,655
(A scholarship student of Myoungjeong Foundation)

362
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,185
What's all this?

363
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:09,520
You shouldn't have gotten off.

364
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
Why didn't you follow her to the end?

365
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,560
Why? It would make her heart drop to see me like that.

366
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,490
It might feel awful for her.

367
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,460
I'm giving her one chance to turn me down.

368
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,275
It's my meticulously calculated manners.

369
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:22,775
You said she was kind.

370
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,840
"He followed me all the way here, so why is he giving up?"

371
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,640
She would feel so sorry for me because I got off like that.

372
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,140
All right, next destination.

373
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,310
- The library. - What?

374
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,280
Love is very classical.

375
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,495
When coincidences repeat itself, you feel like it's destiny.

376
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:43,450
Then she'll accept it as fate. And why?

377
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,490
Because she'll want to believe that.

378
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,160
I'm such a good actor.

379
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,565
I'll be so good.

380
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:52,300
Your eyes are like the mirror of truth from a fairy tale.

381
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,430
It's covered with truth.

382
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,930
You're giving away your true intentions.

383
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,045
It's okay.

384
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:01,945
Not many women can look straight into my eyes. They get too nervous.

385
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:03,670
Can you really like her?

386
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,880
Are you insane? Why would I like her?

387
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,910
She's definitely not my type.

388
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,185
Don't say that.

389
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:13,055
Then why are you still seeing her? Does she know your weakness?

390
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:16,630
Or did you like her so much that you have to meet her...

391
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,065
behind our backs?

392
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:19,990
Did you hang out with her in secret...

393
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,005
because you knew Soo Ji wouldn't approve?

394
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,160
It wasn't a secret.

395
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,600
And she can't be with me anyway.

396
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,530
There's no connection between us.

397
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,800
I really don't want to do this.

398
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,970
Hey, keep memorizing.

399
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,345
Make sure you change your passcode to her number.

400
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:42,410
"The passcode is your phone number."

401
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,525
The passcode is your phone number.

402
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,365
It's good to see you, Tae Hee.
