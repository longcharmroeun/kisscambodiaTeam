00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:08,685
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,905
Right now,

3
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:32,675
you gave me...

4
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,375
a chance to stop.

5
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,385
Despite that, I don't want to end it...

6
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,815
because I started to...

7
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:46,885
draw you in my heart.

8
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:51,295
I won't be weak.

9
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,225
I won't feel lonely.

10
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,035
I don't want you to chase after me.

11
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:02,265
I don't want you to stop me either.

12
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:05,475
Since I started this,

13
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:07,305
I will end it too.

14
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:10,145
Since I was in this relationship by myself,

15
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,275
I will get over you by myself too.

16
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,885
Why did you come here alone? What about Se Joo?

17
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:24,955
Excuse me.

18
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,395
Yes?

19
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:35,305
Soo Ji, have you ever been in love?

20
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:36,800
I don't know.

21
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,535
It's really painful,

22
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:41,575
but I want my pain to continue.

23
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:45,845
You may not be in love with someone,

24
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:49,885
but I'm sure there are a lot of guys who are in love with you.

25
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,185
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:58,525
They will be in pain just like I am, right?

27
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:03,765
(Han Na)

28
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:05,390
(1 Missed Call)

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,905
(Seul Gi)

30
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,005
(Queen Soo Ji)

31
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,400
- What is it? - Where are you?

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,145
I'm near Seoul Arts Center.

33
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:22,715
I was just passing by there. Are you stalking me now?

34
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:32,455
It hurts so much,

35
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:36,025
but I keep wanting to be hurt.

36
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:39,895
My gosh, how many times will you repeat yourself?

37
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:47,705
Hey, you must be Hye Jeong.

38
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:52,515
- Hello. - I'm in love.

39
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:55,385
It hurts so much.

40
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:57,815
Is it me?

41
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:01,255
But I keep wanting to be hurt.

42
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:04,420
Oh, "Il Postino"?

43
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:06,150
You just watched that, didn't you?

44
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,325
What? Is there such a movie?

45
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,835
I didn't know, but it sounds like a great movie.

46
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,790
I'm in love.

47
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,060
Hey, that's enough.

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,705
If you're that into him, you should've gotten his number.

49
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:23,370
Soo Ji, let's say you were struck by lightning.

50
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,515
Do you think you can dial 911?

51
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:29,515
Who is it?

52
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:33,955
This is the only lead.

53
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:37,555
Let's see who he is.

54
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,325
It's Joo An.

55
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,705
You're my savior.

56
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:52,975
Okay, cool.

57
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,815
Joo An, how have you been?

58
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,385
- Why do you think I called? - Se Joo.

59
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:11,955
Your friend is here right now, and he seems a bit weird.

60
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,005
Where are you going?

61
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,670
You brought me here. Did I say I wanted to come?

62
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,475
What's with you?

63
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:36,345
- Si Hyun is inside. - So what?

64
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,715
Is it awkward for you to see him?

65
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,255
You stopped me from going.

66
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:45,895
Don't stop me today.

67
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,615
- What's with him? - If you don't know, how would I?

68
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,095
Hey, it's Se Joo.

69
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,355
Why are you so late?

70
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,625
I missed you.

71
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,895
Soo Ji, you're here too.

72
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:28,905
Kwon Si Hyun.

73
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:30,935
Pull yourself together.

74
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm President Myung's daughter.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,345
I saw you in front of the house.

76
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,440
Si Hyun is a bit drunk,

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,445
and I had no one else to call.

78
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:48,725
Yes, I'll text you our location. Thank you.

79
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,155
Pull yourself together.

80
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:55,795
I called Secretary Yoon. He'll come pick you up.

81
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,235
Soo Ji.

82
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,245
Soo Ji.

83
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:15,385
Soo Ji.

84
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,185
What?

85
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,755
Soo Ji.

86
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:25,495
What...

87
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,595
did you say to Tae Hee?

88
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,165
Tell me.

89
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,475
What did you say to her?

90
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,305
That you and I...

91
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:42,845
like each other.

92
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,715
Am I wrong?

93
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,985
Was that a mistake?

94
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:02,025
No. You've done well.

95
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,080
- I told you not to stop me. - Yes, I'm not stopping you.

96
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,955
But Soo Ji, I need you to answer me for once.

97
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,550
Why do you treat Si Hyun like that, and what's this with Tae Hee?

98
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,590
What?

99
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,160
Do you want to get between them that badly?

100
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,395
Because Si Hyun is yours?

101
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:46,875
What do you want to get from him?

102
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,275
Did that kiss make you feel that sad?

103
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,215
What?

104
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,045
Is that so important?

105
00:07:58,225 --> 00:07:59,355
Darn it.

106
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:02,490
Goodness, you're here.

107
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,325
It's a great place.

108
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:07,895
- Hey. - What?

109
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:12,035
- Why aren't you asking Soo Ji out? - Are you insane?

110
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:16,205
She wants you to ask her out.

111
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:18,735
I did.

112
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:22,605
- She said no. - What did she say?

113
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,675
That such a relationship is bound to be broken.

114
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,085
Is that so?

115
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,215
And?

116
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,455
She wanted a kiss, no strings attached.

117
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,790
- You idiot. - I mean it.

118
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,325
Oh, really? Goodness.

119
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,625
But I didn't do it.

120
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,995
I couldn't.

121
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,935
Why not? You kissed me too.

122
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:53,475
Stop it, you dork.

123
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:55,605
Then why?

124
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,415
You don't like her that much?

125
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:01,115
Or do you like her too much?

126
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:08,655
I like it.

127
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,695
I like this too much.

128
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:18,265
I like how everything is right now.

129
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,365
You didn't kiss her,

130
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:25,575
and you couldn't.

131
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:28,405
Yes. You're right.

132
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,375
Si Hyun is your friend.

133
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:33,200
No, he's a friend who likes you a lot.

134
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,070
That's why he didn't, and he couldn't.

135
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,515
Don't you get it?

136
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:38,280
What do you know?

137
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,380
You might've been touched because of his manners.

138
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,650
Or you might've been sad because you thought...

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,580
he didn't like you that much, but...

140
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,190
they're both your take on this.

141
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,265
You're only trying to protect yourself.

142
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,465
That's funny.

143
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,390
I was delusional about everything, and everything came from that?

144
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,360
You get sad and touched all by yourself.

145
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,130
And you're thinking about him for this long...

146
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,410
because you like how sweet those emotions are.

147
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:04,770
- And it's only hurting you, no? - You're the one who's delusional.

148
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,575
Do you think this is all because of that first kiss?

149
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:09,315
You need to get rid of your childish analysis first.

150
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:11,055
You can't explain this...

151
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,985
if something else was the reason.

152
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,675
This means...

153
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:34,705
nothing to me like it's nothing to you.

154
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,595
(Tae Hee)

155
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,710
- That guy just fell down. - What?

156
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,295
- Is he okay? - Isn't he Kwon Si Hyun?

157
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,720
(Studio for rent)

158
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
I love your place.

159
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,895
Give me your bank account. I'll send the deposit right away.

160
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:37,505
This is only a conditional contract, but you should see the house first.

161
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,575
I don't need to.

162
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,870
I can't find a place like that with that price.

163
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,275
But it's still...

164
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,775
Why are you moving out?

165
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:47,885
Is the landlord weird?

166
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:52,685
Hello? Hello?

167
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,525
Keep it.

168
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,025
Are you throwing it away?

169
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,395
That's my will.

170
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:05,195
He told me not to look.

171
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:18,575
(Kwon Seok Woo and Kwon Si Hyun are not related.)

172
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:28,125
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,025
I will...

174
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:34,765
fly this plane for you later.

175
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:01,555
(JK's heir passed out. He faints so handsomely.)

176
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,225
This is me? Really?

177
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:10,020
It's okay. They blurred your face.

178
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,765
Why didn't you stop me?

179
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:15,435
When we got there, you were already drunk.

180
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:16,805
"We"?

181
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,575
Soo Ji and I.

182
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,145
She was there too. You don't remember?

183
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,115
I don't.

184
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:32,285
I can't believe this.

185
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,155
Why did you drink so much?

186
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:40,155
No reason.

187
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,665
Why isn't Soo Ji with you?

188
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,365
No reason.

189
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,935
Mr. Concussion. Did Tae Hee come by?

190
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,045
It's over for good.

191
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,750
Then is your bet with Soo Ji off too?

192
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:03,845
The one about marriage, whether it's real or not.

193
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,215
Yes.

194
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,555
Then I'll date her.

195
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,125
Sure.

196
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:20,765
I'm off.

197
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,805
Good for you.

198
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:26,760
When will you give me your car?

199
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,445
Make it quick so I can take Soo Ji out.

200
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,515
You're just fine.

201
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:33,945
You have a better car.

202
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:39,215
You look very nice considering you posed.

203
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,455
I didn't pose.

204
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:45,555
I had fun. It reminded me of when I did charity work as an intern.

205
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,525
I've never seen you look like this.

206
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:55,290
Do you mean I qualify to take over JK Charitable Foundation?

207
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,535
Yes.

208
00:14:56,975 --> 00:15:00,135
This is the article the women's magazine asked you to confirm.

209
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:04,845
Do we have to do this?

210
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:07,415
We have to spin the story that your marriage...

211
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:09,285
isn't just a business deal.

212
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,585
I liked the article.

213
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,455
Read it.

214
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,655
Tell them to change the header.

215
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:21,990
(JK and Myoungjeong's Romantic New Beginning)

216
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,565
I'll confirm the revision.

217
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,195
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:31,375
While Si Hyun's hospitalized, he should have a full physical.

219
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:37,175
You didn't know? He's at my hospital.

220
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:40,870
I didn't know he was still there.

221
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,085
Isn't he too young to have a physical check-up?

222
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,985
You scolded him already.

223
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,625
We get such 20-year-olds all the time.

224
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,755
They're learning how much alcohol they can take.

225
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,390
Either way, tell your staff to keep quiet.

226
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,865
Make sure word doesn't get out.

227
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,865
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:05,375
We'll get the FDA's approval sometime this week.

229
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,805
Will the chairwoman be pleased when she returns?

230
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:14,585
How about we set a date?

231
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:18,085
Next month.

232
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,785
Okay. I'll free my schedule.

233
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,025
Why Myoungjeong Hospital?

234
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,295
The staff from elsewhere would talk...

235
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:31,095
Do your job.

236
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,565
If you can't handle him, quit being his butler.

237
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:41,230
Until the FDA makes...

238
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,575
the announcement, the answer to any questions...

239
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:48,310
is that we have no idea and only have hope.

240
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,615
Those are your orders.

241
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,455
Respond that way about my marriage too. Understood?

242
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,825
Yes, sir.

243
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:06,065
(New message from Se Joo)

244
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:12,200
Is it awkward to see me? Why won't you come to our hideout?

245
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,675
Why can't I stand you?

246
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,215
Just in case, you don't have to suffer.

247
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:23,970
Should I just block him?

248
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,515
Won't you visit Si Hyun?

249
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:32,825
Why bother when he's just hungover?

250
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,495
See you here later. Promise me.

251
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,490
(La Marcia)

252
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,305
He's going overboard. This is where people go on dates.

253
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:48,045
What's he doing?

254
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,045
Is he crazy?

255
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:56,215
Welcome, Ms. Soo Ji.

256
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:00,015
You said you couldn't be bothered to go that far,

257
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,185
so I brought the restaurant here.

258
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,225
What's all this?

259
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,025
Have a taste.

260
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:18,335
It's awesome.

261
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,730
You called me over to feed me?

262
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,370
Yes. Taste everything from here to here.

263
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,115
I'm planning a business.

264
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,170
According to matchmaking agencies,

265
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,140
55 percent of women and 42 percent of men...

266
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,440
want to cheat.

267
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,355
This is for real.

268
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:39,795
If you include potential cheaters who refused to answer truthfully,

269
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,820
this is a blue ocean.

270
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,665
See? You're a true living witness.

271
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:51,260
If you guarantee family members won't find out,

272
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,205
customers will line up...

273
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,815
Almost.

274
00:18:58,315 --> 00:18:59,670
How is it?

275
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,010
If you like it, I'll open a branch outside your university.

276
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,470
Outside the music hall.

277
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,455
Does this suit our campus?

278
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:08,855
It doesn't matter. You like it.

279
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:16,050
You want to take them home to eat, don't you?

280
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,565
It's for Si Hyun.

281
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,365
He doesn't remember that night.

282
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:26,035
He wouldn't. He was dead drunk.

283
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,905
Si Hyun and Tae Hee...

284
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:29,775
are completely over.

285
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:34,215
That means your bet is over too.

286
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:37,015
Why should I hear that from you?

287
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,755
In case Si Hyun kept it from you.

288
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:42,250
What?

289
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,625
In case he doesn't tell you it's over with Tae Hee...

290
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:49,095
and keeps stringing you along.

291
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:50,925
That's why I told you.

292
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:55,365
Two secrets are more than enough between us.

293
00:19:56,235 --> 00:20:00,205
Who knows? Could he have told us that it's over...

294
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:03,345
and keep seeing Tae Hee in secret?

295
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:08,815
Don't you know him? He can't lie to us.

296
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:16,610
When he gives me his car, let's go for a drive. Just us two.

297
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,495
What? I'd rather watch a dog eat grass.

298
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,360
- Stop sales. - Stop sales.

299
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,490
It's a threat to the public's health.

300
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,600
- It's a threat. - It's a threat.

301
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,230
Stop lobbying Congress to relax regulation.

302
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,400
- Stop lobbying. - Stop lobbying.

303
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,715
I think the media found out Tiuzen was approved.

304
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,985
They're protesting outside our company.

305
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:50,055
Until it's official, we have to deny knowledge.

306
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,955
Okay.

307
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:55,025
They'll protest outside your office too.

308
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,365
Be careful.

309
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,605
(Mi Ri)

310
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:21,055
The son's here, and he just won't leave.

311
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:25,490
The vice chairman? Would he want to come? He's always frowning.

312
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,355
They say it's a heart condition.

313
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,795
She's here because she doesn't want to see her husband.

314
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:34,705
Don't pity her. This place is better than any hotel.

315
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,565
Pretend you didn't hear that.

316
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:40,605
They talk like that, but the secretaries...

317
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:43,205
are good to me and tell me things.

318
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,815
Hello, ma'am.

319
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:48,885
How do you feel today? Did you get some sleep?

320
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:51,215
Yes. I feel fine.

321
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:55,155
Thanks to you, this place feels like home.

322
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,285
Hello.

323
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:03,295
Come by often. Your mom improves a lot after you visit.

324
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,735
I see why whenever I see you.

325
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,890
How's the patient from yesterday?

326
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,535
There was a problem, but we sorted it out.

327
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,645
Are you eating well?

328
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:38,195
Could I have some tea?

329
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,035
Come in.

330
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:51,045
I want to know things about the day my mom died.

331
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:52,640
Like what?

332
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,940
The car she drove that day has no record of being in an accident.

333
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,185
I find that strange.

334
00:22:57,385 --> 00:22:59,240
It must be an administrative error.

335
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,385
I don't think so.

336
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:03,425
An accident on the same day in that area was reported.

337
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:07,095
That was the only accident that day. It was a hit-and-run.

338
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:09,195
It doesn't make sense no matter how much I think about it.

339
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:11,360
She was supposed to be at the hospital.

340
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,095
I don't know why she went to that unfamiliar city, Jeongeup.

341
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:17,260
And it was a big accident. The lack of its record...

342
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,635
does alarm me.

343
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,575
I'm all right now.

344
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:23,875
You were my mom's doctor.

345
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:26,345
You even went to the hospital in Jeongeup where my mom passed away.

346
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:30,245
I just thought that you might know something about it.

347
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,165
Did you get the details about the hit-and-run case?

348
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:46,120
No, not really. I just know the victim was a student.

349
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,800
If your family didn't tell you the exact nature of your mom's passing,

350
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,665
don't you think there must have been a reason?

351
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:55,145
I can take it.

352
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:04,245
Why didn't you suspect that...

353
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:07,685
your mom could've been the hit-and-run driver?

354
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:12,595
The company squashed the record.

355
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,395
The vice chairman and I, her doctor,

356
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:17,495
are the only people who know what happened.

357
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:23,135
We couldn't let your mom leave this world as an assailant.

358
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:34,415
All we can do is hope that the student is doing well.

359
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:10,445
Even if we broke up, he should know this is a separate matter.

360
00:25:10,815 --> 00:25:12,055
What is this?

361
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:14,885
I don't like how he's handling it.

362
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,225
Darn it.

363
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:21,355
I'll leave him a voice message.

364
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,595
I'll say every swear word I know.

365
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:30,305
It's ringing.

366
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,235
Hello, is this the owner of this phone?

367
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:43,415
You weren't in your ward. I stopped by to see my mom before going.

368
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:45,255
I had tea with her.

369
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:50,055
Since both of you are here, I have something to tell you.

370
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,155
Your dad will tell you about this.

371
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:56,325
We decided to have the wedding next month.

372
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:59,390
- Mom. - It will be a small, family dinner.

373
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,195
It won't be much of an inconvenience for you two.

374
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,435
Are you okay with this, Si Hyun?

375
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,205
Yes.

376
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,575
Hey, Si Hyun.

377
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:15,910
I think he misses his mom.

378
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,985
She was treated at our hospital.

379
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:22,985
Don't tell his dad that he's here.

380
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:24,825
Does he not know...

381
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,555
that he's here?

382
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:28,390
No, I don't think so.

383
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,025
They barely see each other at home.

384
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:34,035
We were hanging out together. I don't want him to scold Si Hyun.

385
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:43,775
(Kwon Si Hyun)

386
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:03,250
When I asked if something happened to Si Hyun,

387
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,695
Se Joo told me what happened.

388
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,635
He wants you to go there.

389
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:18,945
Fine.

390
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,015
The phone.

391
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:24,315
I'll leave after I give him his phone.

392
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:38,735
Mom, you were a good person.

393
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:43,505
Why did you...

394
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,545
What was so hard about it?

395
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:24,005
Why are you crying?

396
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,875
It's just... I have a bad headache.

397
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:32,785
How did you know I was here?

398
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,185
You're changing the topic.

399
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:37,455
Here.

400
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,955
Where did you find this?

401
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:43,365
Someone picked it up at the bar,

402
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,695
but he couldn't call since it was locked.

403
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:48,120
He forgot that he had this phone.

404
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,835
I happened to call him when he turned on the phone.

405
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:54,935
You called me?

406
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:56,305
Why?

407
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:00,200
(Someone wants to rent the studio. I'll start packing.)

408
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,115
I should inform the landlord.

409
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,755
Don't move out.

410
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,685
Do you have to move out?

411
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:13,825
It's uncomfortable for both of us.

412
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,765
Did it hurt a lot?

413
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:24,835
What about you?

414
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:26,935
Me?

415
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,105
It has been hard on you too.

416
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,645
Not really.

417
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:40,440
I have to get going before I miss the last bus.

418
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,655
Already?

419
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:43,555
I came to give you your phone.

420
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,155
Then...

421
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,855
take care.

422
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02,275
I'm sorry for confusing you.

423
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:07,475
I know what Soo Ji must have told you.

424
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:12,355
It is true that I did like her.

425
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,885
I liked her a lot.

426
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,425
I still like her.

427
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,395
But...

428
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,195
I like her as a friend.

429
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:29,865
Se Joo and Soo Ji are dear to my heart.

430
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:33,975
My lack of eloquence makes it hard to explain my friendship with them.

431
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:40,215
But I think I can explain this with certainty.

432
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,255
To me,

433
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:48,625
you and Soo Ji are different.

434
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:56,765
I think...

435
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:00,735
I like you too.

436
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:12,075
I'm getting discharged tomorrow. Can't we go home together, please?

437
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:16,315
My gosh, well...

438
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:19,785
I don't think I can get discharged. I don't have a guardian.

439
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,855
Why don't you have a guardian?

440
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:25,955
I don't talk to my dad.

441
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:32,895
Then...

442
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll wait until you get discharged.

443
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:37,135
Really?

444
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:40,275
Take a seat.

445
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm only staying because being alone at the hospital can be lonely.

446
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,515
Have you ever been hospitalized?

447
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:53,815
Yes, I was in a car accident once.

448
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:59,395
Please don't go. Don't go. Please stay here.

449
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,255
Get up.

450
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:04,495
I get it.

451
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,395
That's why you were so scared.

452
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,335
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:11,975
Your eyes really are...

454
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:14,735
like Cinderella's mirror.

455
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:22,685
I will give you a shot.

456
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,385
But don't make me feel lonely.

457
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:30,055
And I will tell you when I don't like you.

458
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:34,595
Promise me that you will do the same.

459
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:40,135
Nothing is more torturous than being in a one-sided relationship.

460
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:41,835
I won't be in one.

461
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:44,635
Okay.

462
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,155
Here.

463
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:10,065
This must be his mother.

464
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:13,665
Are you...

465
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:16,005
giving me this?

466
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:17,465
Yes.

467
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:22,505
Come closer.

468
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:36,285
It really is nice to have someone in my ward.

469
00:33:36,855 --> 00:33:39,295
I should have visited more often when my mom was here.

470
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:46,165
My mom was treated at this hospital for quite a long time.

471
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:51,735
I had my birthday parties here. She scolded me about my grades here.

472
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,975
Mom, let's have my birthday party at home next year, okay?

473
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,315
Let's do that.

474
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:05,755
I wanted to...

475
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:09,155
go back home with my mom.

476
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:13,895
You should get some sleep.

477
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:15,925
When you wake up,

478
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:18,395
you and I can go home together.

479
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:22,035
Okay.
