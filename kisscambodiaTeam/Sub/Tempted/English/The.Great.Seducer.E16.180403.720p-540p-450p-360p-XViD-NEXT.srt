00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,562
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,169
I'm really busy with homework.

3
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:35,405
It's nice and clean.

4
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,507
Isn't it? This is nothing.

5
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,810
- I'll make you coffee. Get to work. - What?

6
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:48,118
I don't eat at home much.

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,890
I eat two packs in one go.

8
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,958
You do?

9
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,826
Why are you so shocked?

10
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:01,331
Eating instant noodles isn't a balanced diet.

11
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:04,134
It's okay if I add an egg and some vegetables.

12
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:11,141
There are no eggs or cold rice.

13
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,743
- Just cat food? - If you're going to nag, leave.

14
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:15,912
This won't do. I must visit often.

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,380
Like a snake bride.

16
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:20,650
You mean the snail bride.

17
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,259
I was thinking...

18
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:33,463
Could you change your passcode to my phone number?

19
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,866
It is your number.

20
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:42,639
But still, ring the doorbell.

21
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,674
I will decide whether to let you in or not.

22
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:46,042
Of course.

23
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,246
You should finish your homework.

24
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:06,556
Manners.

25
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,331
What do you want so early?

26
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:26,109
You can't stay indoors just doing homework.

27
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,912
You need to get out, exercise, and see the sun.

28
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,414
- I don't care. - You do, so keep up.

29
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,283
1, 2. 1, 2.

30
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,686
Leave it. I'm exhausted.

31
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,689
I'm too tired. I can't run anymore.

32
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:41,257
Come on.

33
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:46,429
You always pick me up.

34
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,031
There.

35
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,469
What homework are you so stressed about?

36
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,304
I have to...

37
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,941
select a location and build a model.

38
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,777
I'm stuck because I've never been there.

39
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,580
Just go. Shall I come with you?

40
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:05,882
I picked too hard a location.

41
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,021
Are you okay?

42
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,790
Are you okay?

43
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,958
Hey.

44
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:19,496
I saved your head.

45
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:22,499
Your hand...

46
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,741
- Hey. - What?

47
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,843
You look like one nudge will make you cry.

48
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,547
I really will cry if you do this again.

49
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,917
How will you go and scope out your target?

50
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:45,722
If you're that worried, come with me.

51
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:48,358
You bet. Were you going to go alone?

52
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,994
- Yes. - You can't.

53
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,128
I must come along.

54
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:54,831
You need a driver and a porter.

55
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,167
Take me with you.

56
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,171
Okay, then.

57
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,040
Hurry back after class so we can pack.

58
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,744
Why pack already when we leave in two days?

59
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:10,980
I've noticed you for a while.

60
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,850
Your cello makes a lovely sound.

61
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:17,720
Techniques, you can perfect along the way.

62
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,457
Why don't you play the solo starting next week?

63
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,725
Pardon?

64
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:25,194
It's unusual to let a freshman play the solo,

65
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,431
but you're much better than the rest.

66
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,733
Don't you think it'll be worth the try?

67
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,970
Okay. I'll do my best.

68
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,138
Good.

69
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:37,807
Come to me if you need any help.

70
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,243
Right.

71
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:44,714
It's one of our projects.

72
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:48,551
We're going to ask companies to support classical musicians.

73
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,920
Could you arrange a meeting with your father?

74
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,526
With my father?

75
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:58,561
I saw this, you see.

76
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,731
If it would look bad to go directly to your father,

77
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:03,967
I can contact the JK Cultural Foundation instead.

78
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,501
Talk to him for me.

79
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,541
Think about it,

80
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,476
and get back to me.

81
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,753
(VC Kwon Seok Woo Engaged to Myung Mi Ri)

82
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:25,755
What a twist of fate.

83
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,724
Of all the magazines out there...

84
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:31,628
I'm angry.

85
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:34,564
I want to hurt her.

86
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:37,667
Eat first.

87
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:41,070
- You look terrible. - How do I look?

88
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,907
You look pretty. So eat up.

89
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,212
Tell me. Who do you want to hurt?

90
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:50,980
These three and Eun Tae Hee.

91
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:52,548
Pick one.

92
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,050
Anyone.

93
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,086
Other than my mom.

94
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:03,726
Don't think about it. You feel bad already.

95
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:08,564
If anyone wanted to hurt 1 of these 3 adults,

96
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:11,401
it would be Si Hyun.

97
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:13,803
Shall I ask Tae Hee...

98
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:16,372
if she knows about her mom and Si Hyun's dad?

99
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,473
Choi Soo Ji.

100
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,945
I want you to forget about them.

101
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,516
- Have fun playing your cello. - What am I to do?

102
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,852
Tell Si Hyun? He'll feel worse than I do.

103
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:33,389
Go get your passport.

104
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:34,791
We both feel disgusted.

105
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,859
- Shall we have wagyu in Fukuoka? - Newsflash.

106
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:40,363
Tiuzen was supposedly granted preferential favors during testing.

107
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:44,567
With civic groups protesting that the drug should be destroyed...

108
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,336
and the drug in danger of being denied route to market,

109
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,839
Myung Mi Ri, the president of Myoungjeong Hospital...

110
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,475
that is under technical cooperation with JK Bio,

111
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,877
gave a press conference to explain the issue.

112
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:58,014
Okay. I'll...

113
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,684
Stop it right now.

114
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:05,221
Some of the media present is strongly antagonistic to JK.

115
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,522
Secretary Yoon.

116
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,925
Would I've taken a stand if I wasn't prepared?

117
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,373
Before I make my statement,

118
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,678
I wish to apologize for the concern that JK has caused the public.

119
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,814
I am very sorry.

120
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:37,887
(Myoungjeong Foundation's President Myung's Press Conference)

121
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,494
I am here to explain the misconceptions...

122
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:47,396
about Tiuzen from an expert's perspective.

123
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,165
After a new drug is released,

124
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:53,035
the rule of thumb is to track 600 to 3,000 cases.

125
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:56,305
But Tiuzen, unlike other synthetic drugs,

126
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:58,908
is a stem cell drug which is used much less frequently.

127
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,943
It's very hard to reach the case quota.

128
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:04,647
This is a common problem that bio medicines face during development.

129
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:06,983
It's a problem many companies face when launching a new medication.

130
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,552
JK Group has attached explanatory materials...

131
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:11,554
and have requested according to the law...

132
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,389
to adjust the number of case-control study to 90...

133
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,358
and is waiting for the result.

134
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,761
JK Group will abide by any decision which...

135
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,062
the FDA comes to,

136
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:21,564
and we would like to add...

137
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:25,868
that we have never come in contact with any government officials...

138
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,770
during the entire process.

139
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,239
- JK Bio will continue to... - Did you watch the news?

140
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,975
When should I tell her to sell JK Bio's shares?

141
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:36,379
JK Bio will become the forerunners of the bio industry.

142
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,381
- Ms. Jung. - Hello, Ms. Jo.

143
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,250
My husband will give you a go sign tomorrow.

144
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,786
Se Ri, it's me.

145
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:46,055
Then what about Myoungjeong's shares?

146
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,891
The government must bring down the requirement.

147
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,193
Thanks, Geun Sook.

148
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,894
Please do not misunderstand.

149
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:57,366
JK Group has quieted down Chairwoman Hong's stock buyout,

150
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,369
and Vice Chairman Kwon has listed a losing company,

151
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,938
JK Bio, in the market by force.

152
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,706
So any statement by JK is rather hard to believe.

153
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:05,708
And it was listed thanks to Tiuzen.

154
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,778
How can we believe this excuse that's covered with special favors?

155
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:13,382
What happened in the past has nothing to do with this.

156
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,084
I am here to tell you...

157
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:18,120
that there was nothing illegal done during the adjustment procedure...

158
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:19,655
of this incident.

159
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,024
Tiuzen is a new drug that was created...

160
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:25,428
before JK and Myoungjeong began to cooperate.

161
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,196
Doesn't this prove...

162
00:10:27,196 --> 00:10:30,399
a mix-up between a corporation and a hospital like some suggested?

163
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,038
- That's... - Let me ask you again.

164
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,306
President Myung,

165
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,543
if you do not take part in the management after your wedding,

166
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,979
that will prove the legitimacy of your marriage.

167
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,681
Why don't you make a promise right here?

168
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:49,819
Do I...

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,390
have to prove my love to you?

170
00:10:57,994 --> 00:10:59,128
Well, it's...

171
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,864
because JK Group's history isn't very trustworthy.

172
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:06,135
Of course, I'll help out as much as I can.

173
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,006
He's not just a vice chairman of JK Group.

174
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,742
He's a man whom I love.

175
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:20,883
If you have no more questions, we'll wrap this up.

176
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,093
Right.

177
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,463
He took in my mom to use her like that.

178
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:38,000
Si Hyun probably didn't watch the news, right?

179
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:42,505
How can you be worried about him even now?

180
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,774
Let me leave my cello here.

181
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:47,410
It's okay.

182
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,578
I'm just going shopping.

183
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:03,125
Congratulations on the success of your exhibition.

184
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,061
Are you wrapping up?

185
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,805
(Are you wrapping up?)

186
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,307
Yes. I'm sending them all away.

187
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,942
I feel free and sad.

188
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:23,813
Where will I find you now without the exhibition hall?

189
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,749
You have my number. Don't worry.

190
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,654
Goodness.

191
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,462
Are you here for the exhibition?

192
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:42,164
I'm sorry. It's over. We're packing up.

193
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:44,967
Gosh, I'm a bit late.

194
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,837
I wanted to come here after reading your interview.

195
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:50,773
Yes, the magazine. Your interview must be out.

196
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,441
Gi Ho, did you get the magazine?

197
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:54,577
Yes, I'll bring it right now.

198
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:58,547
I brought it too. May I ask you for an autograph?

199
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,984
- I want to remember my visit. - Thanks for asking.

200
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:04,086
It's awkward for me to give out an autograph.

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,455
- There's a page that's folded. - There are...

202
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:09,058
a few pieces left. You can take a look.

203
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:10,126
Okay.

204
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:15,564
(Shipping Addresses)

205
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,540
(Vice Chairman Kwon Seok Woo Engaged to President Myung Mi Ri)

206
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,153
Right here.

207
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,299
Thank you.

208
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,601
I will make sure...

209
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:54,570
I come to your next exhibit.

210
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,074
(Shipping Addresses)

211
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:08,551
That crazy idiot. That scumbag.

212
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,355
Young Won, are you okay?

213
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:32,308
The one who's listed under our address bought 23 pieces.

214
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:35,878
This means Mom knows.

215
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm sorry for shouting at you before.

216
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,169
Forget it.

217
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,142
What happened?

218
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,912
My dad called me then threw papers at me.

219
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:12,114
Are you okay?

220
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:13,582
What about you?

221
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,217
Is something going on?

222
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:19,021
No, not at all.

223
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,896
Soo Ji, did you get a lot of cute stuff?

224
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:30,466
- Where are you? - At our place with Si Hyun.

225
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:36,105
I see. I was going to stop by and give you your cello.

226
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,907
Make sure you keep your business going.

227
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:40,142
I can stop by before class tomorrow.

228
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,945
Okay, that works.

229
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:46,348
Tell Si Hyun to come by and bring up the sales.

230
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,317
Okay.

231
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:50,452
Bye.

232
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:56,325
Goodness. Se Joo has been living very diligently.

233
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,394
He wants you to come and bring up the sales.

234
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,030
I'm going to live diligently too.

235
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,133
How?

236
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,102
No idea, but whatever it may be.

237
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,271
I want to try doing that too.

238
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:21,083
Soo Ji, I miss you.

239
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,320
Come hang out with me when I'm done with middle school math.

240
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:26,388
It's Hye Jeong.

241
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,257
You like her, don't you?

242
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:33,128
Well, she's cute. She's okay.

243
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,764
That's really interesting.

244
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:39,268
It was only a little while ago when you wanted to bully her,

245
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:40,836
but you two are best friends now.

246
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:43,806
She's got another boyfriend who isn't Ki Young.

247
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:47,309
Right, a few days ago,

248
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,245
Se Joo, Kyung Joo, and I...

249
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,914
had to make an alibi for her and her boyfriend.

250
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,583
Hye Jeong left her phone with me and went on a date, and...

251
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:57,620
Why?

252
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:03,259
Nothing.

253
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,295
It feels weird to catch up with you.

254
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:09,665
You're right.

255
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:14,303
Did you move out for good? What's with you and Mr. Kwon?

256
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:23,545
You can't even tell us?

257
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,081
Well... Later.

258
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,084
You'll find out later.

259
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:34,323
Aren't you going to tell me?

260
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:36,792
How did you know...

261
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:39,862
that my dad was seeing someone else?

262
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:44,700
Why do you want to know? It'll only make you sad.

263
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,704
Tell me. I need to know.

264
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:53,842
I can't face you if she ends up suffering like my mom did.

265
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:55,611
Let's not even think about that.

266
00:17:58,314 --> 00:18:00,949
My mom probably won't even care about that anyway.

267
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:05,954
Don't get in trouble with your dad.

268
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,991
And don't watch the news for a while too.

269
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:12,528
Make sure you eat well.

270
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:15,097
- You look worn out. - Gosh.

271
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:34,249
Great job today. And I'm sorry.

272
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:36,151
It's okay.

273
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:39,221
- I hope it ends well. - Let's have dinner.

274
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,523
You haven't eaten, have you?

275
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:43,459
When do you get off work?

276
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,595
Thanks, but I want to rest.

277
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,697
I want to go home.

278
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:50,499
Are you okay?

279
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,167
I'm looking for my earring...

280
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,303
that I dropped during the press conference.

281
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,207
If I can look for an earring,

282
00:18:58,574 --> 00:19:00,376
doesn't that mean I'm fine?

283
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,695
Don't interfere.

284
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:22,131
Trying to stop the press conference...

285
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,735
in front of Seok Woo was you going too far.

286
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,104
Can't you turn back?

287
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,307
After you got divorced last time.

288
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:37,413
I got my hopes up that maybe I stood a chance.

289
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:42,484
I gave up soon after because I know what you're like.

290
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:46,188
This isn't about that hope.

291
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:48,657
I want you...

292
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,627
to live with less of a burden.

293
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,271
Do you know how you look?

294
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,175
You look pitiful like a beauty who fell in love with a monster.

295
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,111
That's how you and I are different.

296
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:13,982
You pity yourself for liking me.

297
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:17,119
I root myself for liking Kwon Seok Woo.

298
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,788
We're different from the start.

299
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:22,925
- Mi Ri. - I also...

300
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,564
once imagined that I'd get a chance.

301
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,134
Each time his ex-wife was admitted...

302
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:34,336
to my hospital, I treated her as best I could.

303
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,005
I still envied her.

304
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:40,709
I like Seok Woo.

305
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:44,880
So don't look at me so pitifully.

306
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:47,683
You know he's seeing her again.

307
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,619
You want both Seok Woo and the company.

308
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,055
You'll never be satisfied.

309
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:54,890
I...

310
00:20:58,327 --> 00:20:59,928
don't want to see you struggle.

311
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:06,835
That's my burden to bear. You needn't worry about that.

312
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,505
Thanks for finding my earring.

313
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,022
Mom.

314
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:01,924
Isn't this pretty?

315
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:04,593
This flower's called an anemone.

316
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:06,562
It means many things.

317
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:11,700
"Betrayal".

318
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,636
- "Helpless love". - "Helpless love".

319
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:16,705
"Empty love".

320
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:21,276
"Thanks for being there for me."

321
00:22:22,044 --> 00:22:24,746
"I will give you my everything."

322
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:28,517
"Even if you do not love me,"

323
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,353
"I still love you."

324
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,290
It has so many meanings,

325
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,959
and every one of them is sad.

326
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:39,828
She's crazy because her grades are messed up.

327
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:42,931
Hey.

328
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:47,669
Flowers look best when tucked behind your ear like this.

329
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:48,770
Hello.

330
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:51,707
This is my flower from now on.

331
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:53,875
Remember that.

332
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:01,083
He's not just a vice chairman of JK Group.

333
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,218
He's a man...

334
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,187
The whole world knew,

335
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:08,023
but I didn't.

336
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,761
(Kwon Seok Woo)

337
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:18,000
The receiver cannot be reached.

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,368
(Young Won)

339
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,814
Mother.

340
00:23:33,782 --> 00:23:35,384
I asked the media...

341
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:38,086
not to mention the stocks under borrowed names.

342
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:42,090
The press conference turned things in our favor.

343
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:48,430
Secretary Yoon, excuse us.

344
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:50,799
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:56,238
I don't think you like her enough to marry her.

346
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:59,274
What is your plan?

347
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:00,976
You know.

348
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:04,546
Myoungjeong can revive the JK Bio business...

349
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:05,914
that I ruined.

350
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:08,750
You're still...

351
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:11,286
so naive.

352
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:14,690
You'll get remarried and erase...

353
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:16,525
the deficit that you caused.

354
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:18,727
JK Bio will become a success.

355
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,129
If you're planning to do that and then give her...

356
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,732
a few shares to divorce her, stop it.

357
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:28,103
She's ambitious and very capable.

358
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,706
Do you think she'll do what you say...

359
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,441
and give you what you want?

360
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,975
That's not my plan.

361
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:36,878
Then will you let her run the business instead?

362
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:41,149
Do you want to take a step back and control her from the shadows?

363
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:45,487
If that's what you're thinking, bring Si Hyun into the company.

364
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,523
Until Si Hyun and Yeo Min can take over,

365
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:50,726
stay in control of the company.

366
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,928
That is your duty.

367
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,832
Mother.

368
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,301
If your older brother hadn't gone on...

369
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,803
that business trip instead of you...

370
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:06,274
and if you hadn't lost your mind and tried to date that woman again,

371
00:25:06,274 --> 00:25:08,577
your brother, his wife, and Si Hyun's mom...

372
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:11,580
wouldn't have died the way they did.

373
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:17,486
If you feel guilty toward Yeo Min and Si Hyun,

374
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,423
then you will...

375
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:23,658
do your duty.

376
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,235
- Are you ready? - I am.

377
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:36,571
Why pack a toothbrush?

378
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,007
We might spend the night.

379
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:41,576
I'm going to come back before dinner.

380
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,649
We're taking the subway.

381
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:49,818
The subway? It's that close?

382
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,787
Yes. It only takes an hour.

383
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:54,890
We should take the car anyway.

384
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,259
That way, it'll be just us.

385
00:25:58,293 --> 00:25:59,394
No.

386
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:03,098
What'll you do to me if we miss the last train?

387
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,000
You animal.

388
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:09,704
Give me that. You hurt your hand. I'll carry everything.

389
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,540
Okay.

390
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,951
- Isn't it lovely? - Yes.

391
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:25,020
I thought you'd like it.

392
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:28,857
Did you pick a place you wanted to show me?

393
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:30,559
Yes.

394
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:33,929
I'm off to do my homework.

395
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:36,832
Okay. What should I do, then?

396
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:41,503
Come with me.

397
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:17,539
(Let me live with the person I love.)

398
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,212
Your birthday constellation is...

399
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,715
the one located where the sun is...

400
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:36,084
at noon on the day of your birth.

401
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,086
That's when I learned that...

402
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,456
constellations change with the seasons...

403
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:44,993
and that even stars aren't forever.

404
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:47,295
The cycle is 16,000 years and...

405
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,763
I thought it a great pity.

406
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:51,599
- That's why... - Why hadn't we...

407
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,568
met sooner and in different circumstances?

408
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:55,470
On my birthday...

409
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,605
The winter when I first met you.

410
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,641
The spring we're welcoming together.

411
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,409
It's so precious to me.

412
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,912
- I want to tell you so. - It might change seasons.

413
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:08,483
Anyway, you can't see Aries right now.

414
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,986
I'll tell you when it comes out in fall...

415
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,829
Can I stay by your side...

416
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,665
when winter comes again?

417
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,136
One day, you'll find out...

418
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:30,572
about my big lie too.

419
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:33,508
For the first time,

420
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,377
I became scared.

421
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,368
(Tempted)

422
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:03,071
Don't you think we need something more?

423
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:06,107
I mean, there's something that's kind of missing...

424
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,876
My goodness.

425
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,477
You try to be so cool.

426
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:11,746
- You try to be so romantic. - Stop it.

427
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,681
Don't you want to sleep next to me?

428
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,817
Don't worry. I won't bite.

429
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,485
I won't lay a finger on you.

430
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:20,688
I...

431
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:25,193
really want to sleep next to you.
