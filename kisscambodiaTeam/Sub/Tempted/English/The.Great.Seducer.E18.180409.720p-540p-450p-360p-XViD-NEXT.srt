00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,185
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:15,425
I'm sorry, but I want to be left alone.

3
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:17,525
What?

4
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,205
What?

5
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,005
Have some.

6
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:33,875
It's for your hangover.

7
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,445
Drink it.

8
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,785
If you're beaten up, that means you went home yesterday.

9
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:45,280
Then you should've slept and opened for business...

10
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:46,855
instead of going to a hotel.

11
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,925
I guess someone's there.

12
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:02,005
Aren't you embarrassed? You must be ashamed.

13
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,535
Is this your way of...

14
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,505
paying me back just because I kissed you once?

15
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:11,275
And that's not all. Why won't you pick up my calls?

16
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:15,115
I'll be generous and let you off. Think about what you've done.

17
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,585
You...

18
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:20,385
can't even call Si Hyun if something happens between you two.

19
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:22,555
But it must be easy with me.

20
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:26,495
Se Joo.

21
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:30,695
Like you've always said, that kind of love can't exist between us.

22
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,565
You said it yourself.

23
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:35,705
You told us to spend a night and forget about everything.

24
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,575
This can't happen between us. Okay?

25
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:42,575
What have I done to you?

26
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:45,045
What?

27
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:47,615
Why are you smiling? I didn't catch that.

28
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:49,015
No.

29
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,285
We can't do that. You're right.

30
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,555
Then...

31
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,525
shall we do it once and forget about it?

32
00:01:58,722 --> 00:01:59,995
Do you want to go upstairs?

33
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:03,395
Hey.

34
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:07,435
There are some jokes that...

35
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:10,505
you should never make even between us.

36
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:33,395
I began to get less depressed...

37
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:36,595
as I saw this mural come together.

38
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:45,605
You don't look so well either.

39
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,775
Is that pretty girl doing well? Your girlfriend.

40
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,445
Yes.

41
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:57,385
She's doing well.

42
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:01,925
You must be upset with her.

43
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:05,125
You can just tell when you're my age.

44
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:10,765
I feel so sorry and guilty toward her about something.

45
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,235
Try apologizing.

46
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,205
A man who apologizes properly...

47
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,105
is a great one.

48
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:21,305
I can't apologize.

49
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,345
I want an apology from someone.

50
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:28,045
The man I like...

51
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,515
hid something from me,

52
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:32,585
and I found out.

53
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,755
Isn't it funny that...

54
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:38,895
at my age, I got upset because of a man I like?

55
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:41,695
How did you feel after you found out?

56
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,465
Were you angry?

57
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:45,460
At first,

58
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,865
I was angry because I felt as if he'd deceived me.

59
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,905
Thinking that he hid it from me...

60
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,475
made me sad.

61
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,375
He just couldn't...

62
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,375
bring himself to tell me.

63
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,615
Would you accept if he apologized?

64
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,585
Apologies mean nothing.

65
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,755
We can never be together.

66
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,225
I'm still wondering.

67
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,865
If I tell him I found out about his secret,

68
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,435
that means...

69
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,505
I can never see him again.

70
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,845
I'm hiding something from her too.

71
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,215
If I were you,

72
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,940
I'd tell her everything...

73
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,885
or stop before she finds out.

74
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:43,925
Not knowing at all would hurt less.

75
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,135
Hello, detective.

76
00:04:56,432 --> 00:05:00,000
About the Jeongeup hit-and-run from two years ago in January...

77
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:02,070
Could you tell me the victim's name?

78
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,345
Also, if there were any tip-offs.

79
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:09,140
Revealing their name would be breaking the law.

80
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:11,410
I think the victim is someone I know.

81
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:14,110
- I'm concerned. - I still can't tell you.

82
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:17,350
I heard something while looking into the case.

83
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:18,720
The victim recovered...

84
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,125
and got into a good university this year.

85
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,990
- Okay. - Don't you worry.

86
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:27,235
That's all I can tell you.

87
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,035
Okay, thank you.

88
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:43,440
What call did you take so seriously?

89
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:44,615
It's nothing.

90
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,150
Why did Soo Ji leave her cello behind?

91
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:49,425
Is something wrong?

92
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:53,725
Didn't you call her?

93
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:56,165
No, why?

94
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,060
Her mom gave a press conference about your dad's company.

95
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:01,705
Instead of your dad.

96
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,075
I see.

97
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:09,470
Soo Ji worries about you every day,

98
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:12,440
but you went on a trip. Did you have fun?

99
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,715
How did you know?

100
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,785
Ko Kyung Joo, seriously...

101
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:20,655
It's okay. Soo Ji doesn't know.

102
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,655
But...

103
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:24,750
why are you still seeing Tae Hee?

104
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,795
Does she have something on you?

105
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:27,995
Like what?

106
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:29,620
Or...

107
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:32,865
do you like her so much that you must go on seeing her...

108
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:34,835
behind our backs?

109
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:36,930
Tell me.

110
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:39,005
You went on the trip and kept it from Soo Ji,

111
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:41,075
knowing she'd get upset.

112
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:42,745
It's not a secret.

113
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,740
She and I can't be together.

114
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:49,315
Are you Romeo and Juliet? Why can't you be together?

115
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,885
If you can't date her,

116
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,355
come back to reality.

117
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:04,065
Don't worry. I'm going to anyway.

118
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:08,535
You're such a jerk.

119
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm excited.

120
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:15,245
I'll get to see your nasty side after such a long time.

121
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:19,045
How are things with you and Soo Ji?

122
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:23,385
We, of all people, can't be together, don't you think?

123
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,485
What?

124
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:29,325
You're both here.

125
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,105
Something's fishy.

126
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:49,170
Did you hit him again?

127
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,700
- No. - No.

128
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:53,340
I'm right. Stop beating him.

129
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,840
I said no.

130
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:56,815
Make up already.

131
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,080
Darn it.

132
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,985
It's all your fault. You disappeared over the weekend.

133
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:02,755
She's right.

134
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,325
Why weren't you here?

135
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,725
Where were you? What did you do?

136
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:08,720
He'll answer,

137
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:10,495
so give him time to breathe.

138
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:13,435
He has this master plan. Right?

139
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,405
A master plan?

140
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,105
Is it something fun?

141
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:20,675
Eun Tae Hee.

142
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,385
I doubted it, but it was true.

143
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,555
You spent the weekend with her.

144
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:41,125
- Did you lie to us? - Our bet is off anyway.

145
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,865
- Should I tell you everything? - How is the bet off?

146
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:46,935
You want information from me.

147
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:49,835
The woman your dad is seeing.

148
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,900
Are we going to discuss that here?

149
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:57,045
Why not?

150
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,315
Can't Se Joo know?

151
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,115
Because your dad will look bad?

152
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:05,785
No. Who cares? It's us.

153
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:09,055
After I see what you do to Tae Hee,

154
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:12,625
- I'll tell you who it is. - Leave the adults alone.

155
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:13,995
Both of you.

156
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,095
How can I stop now that I know?

157
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,965
That wouldn't be like us, would it?

158
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,135
I am curious though.

159
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,905
What face will she make when you abandon her?

160
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,045
Does she like you a lot?

161
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,855
If you aren't sure, date her for a bit longer.

162
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,355
I think that would be more fun.

163
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,165
There's no need to stall.

164
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,535
But Tae Hee has nothing to do with this.

165
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,530
I'll make the call whether you tell me about...

166
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,405
my dad's woman or not.

167
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,945
I'll do what I want.

168
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:23,520
Sorry, please trust me once more.

169
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,435
I'm your secret storage, after all.

170
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:49,555
Mom.

171
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,125
What should I do?

172
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:04,235
- Thanks. - Sure.

173
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:08,475
I have something to tell you.

174
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:10,375
What is it?

175
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,015
Aunt Mi Soon's husband.

176
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,085
Isn't he still at the hospital?

177
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,355
I heard the treatment's costing a fortune.

178
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:23,355
Lower your voice.

179
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:26,025
I wonder if you pay her a lot.

180
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,065
She bought a lot of pottery.

181
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,195
(Shipping Receipt)

182
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:34,635
I bought them.

183
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:36,135
Why?

184
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,505
For Seok Woo?

185
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,745
No, for me.

186
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,215
Guess what, Mom?

187
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,615
You can deceive everyone else,

188
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:51,115
but I see through all your expressions.

189
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,610
The artist's not famous,

190
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:57,255
so you aren't planning to resell for a profit.

191
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:00,250
You don't enjoy giving presents.

192
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,895
I wondered why you bought so many ceramics.

193
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,860
I thought what my cello means to me...

194
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,265
and figured it out right away.

195
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:11,800
"How would I feel if I lost the chance to perform?"

196
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,230
"How would I feel..."

197
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:16,175
"if I recorded an album and someone destroyed them all?"

198
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:22,315
Tell me how you found out.

199
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,385
I really didn't want to know.

200
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:30,425
At the exhibition hall in the hotel we met for dinner,

201
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,425
I saw Seok Woo alone with the potter.

202
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:37,295
Mom.

203
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:40,535
Stop it, please.

204
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,105
It's pitiful.

205
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,845
No, it's not pitiful at all.

206
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,415
You don't have to mind this.

207
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,895
Mom, if you won't stop,

208
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:11,565
I can't either.

209
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,405
Tiuzen's post-marketing surveillance deadline has been extended.

210
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:21,575
We'll be handing out the press release in the afternoon.

211
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,475
Sounds good.

212
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:24,845
Great job.

213
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:27,015
Tell Myoungjeong too.

214
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:31,555
You should call her yourself.

215
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,655
I'll take care of it.

216
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:37,850
Yes, sir.

217
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:39,725
("Tiuzen's Deadline Extended")

218
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,235
(Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol)

219
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,525
This is Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol's secretary.

220
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:10,925
Hello.

221
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:16,865
I wanted to thank him for helping Tiuzen pass the screening.

222
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:19,235
Is he busy?

223
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:22,660
He asks you to refrain from calling him...

224
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:24,305
on his private number.

225
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,930
What do you mean?

226
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:28,275
I mean, at least JK got something out of it.

227
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:31,670
This whole incident put the assemblyman...

228
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:33,345
in a lot of trouble.

229
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,265
Are you going somewhere?

230
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,365
Yes.

231
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:56,605
Are you still angry at me?

232
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,605
I'm not angry at you.

233
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:02,045
I just needed some time to think alone.

234
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:06,345
You know, Si Hyun.

235
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,315
I believe everything you tell me as it is.

236
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,555
If you say you're angry, you are.

237
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,155
If you like something, you like that.

238
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:17,825
You know that I always take your word as it is, right?

239
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:22,465
I take your words as they are.

240
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,235
Okay.

241
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:31,105
I have to go to school, then.

242
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:35,245
Tae Hee.

243
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:40,145
Do you want to go together? I'll give you a ride.

244
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:42,415
What?

245
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:43,515
And...

246
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:48,355
if you have time tonight, let's meet up.

247
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:53,825
Okay.

248
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,395
Let's go.

249
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:05,030
He gave you a ride, and he wants to see you tonight.

250
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:06,805
He's not angry anymore.

251
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:10,175
I don't think he's completely okay.

252
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,745
It'll take a little longer for him to feel better.

253
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:16,915
It's been a while.

254
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:20,785
- Hey. - It's been long since that trip.

255
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,455
- Yes. - Do you have a lot of classes left?

256
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:27,125
No, we're all done for the day.

257
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,095
Really?

258
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:31,065
Okay, then. See you tonight.

259
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,135
What?

260
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:37,035
What was that? Is she coming too?

261
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:43,075
This isn't good.

262
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:45,870
You need to go back home.

263
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,670
- What? - You have to do as I say.

264
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:48,710
Why?

265
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:51,315
Wear something bright and pretty, not something dull.

266
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,380
And put makeup on, not just sun block.

267
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,625
Yes, I know. I start with the toner.

268
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:06,565
And lose that old lip balm.

269
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:09,435
Hey.

270
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,805
I don't usually put makeup on, but when I do, I'm really good.

271
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:52,045
Mom.

272
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,515
I'm sorry that it's been so long.

273
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,715
You're watching over me, right?

274
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,025
If...

275
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,865
you are watching over me,

276
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:17,335
that means you know how much pain I'm in, right?

277
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:21,275
I have so many questions for you.

278
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:23,975
How can you...

279
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,545
leave me without telling me anything?

280
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,985
I've never blamed you for anything.

281
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,555
I really haven't.

282
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,395
Why did you do that?

283
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:47,135
She's the first person I really liked in my life.

284
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,505
Why did you do that to her?

285
00:18:57,172 --> 00:19:00,545
Why didn't you stop me if you saw that I was dating Tae Hee?

286
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:04,485
You should've stopped me.

287
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:16,795
Never mind.

288
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,365
Don't be sorry for me, Mom.

289
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,935
You must've had the hardest time.

290
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:28,945
And Tae Hee.

291
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,815
I'll take care of her...

292
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,255
before we have to feel...

293
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:46,795
even sorrier for her.

294
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,670
(Young Won: Can you come and see me?)

295
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:08,815
Can you come and see me?

296
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:32,605
- I... - You're getting married.

297
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,675
I told you. You're a big name.

298
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:43,415
It would've been better if you told me this time.

299
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,785
You can't do this to me again.

300
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,025
Why are you getting married?

301
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:54,995
Do you like her?

302
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:57,295
No.

303
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:00,065
I need her.

304
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,335
Then be good to her.

305
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,305
You should be more faithful if you need her.

306
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:11,245
You didn't choose me even when you were a freer man.

307
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:14,445
Before, it was just me who would've gotten hurt.

308
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,515
But we have our kids,

309
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:19,085
people of this world,

310
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:21,455
and your mom who's probably still the same.

311
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,095
We can't be freed from them.

312
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,165
And you and I...

313
00:21:28,724 --> 00:21:30,465
have failed once before.

314
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,165
You shouldn't do that again.

315
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:35,935
Young Won.

316
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:39,805
I know that I'm a jerk,

317
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:44,375
and this sounds crazy.

318
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,215
Can you just let me come by and see you...

319
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:51,485
from time to time?

320
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,055
Even if it's...

321
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,825
just for a few months.

322
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:00,025
No.

323
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,865
That belittles me too much.

324
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,535
I waited for you three times.

325
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:10,135
First, people at your company told me about your wedding.

326
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:11,475
Second,

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,705
I waited for you like a crazy woman after you divorced.

328
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:17,475
Please just go.

329
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,685
I'm doing this again.

330
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,155
I always tell you to go,

331
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:28,555
knowing that you won't listen.

332
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:38,165
Goodbye.

333
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:11,395
We missed out on dating each other many times.

334
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,665
We aren't meant to be.

335
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,405
We met again.

336
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,375
Yes.

337
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,305
But this is it.

338
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:23,745
I should've listened to you.

339
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,785
Before you found out,

340
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:32,085
I should've ended it then.

341
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:02,915
I had a feeling you'd be here.

342
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:08,125
- You had this much? - While I waited.

343
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,225
Did you eat dinner?

344
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:11,925
No.

345
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:15,465
Does she know we'll be here?

346
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,265
Must I tell?

347
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:33,745
You told me to dress up.

348
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:36,315
I thought the spotlight was on you.

349
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:39,985
Why are we meeting here?

350
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:41,455
It must be so expensive.

351
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,555
I bet they meet here all the time.

352
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:45,825
It's Soo Ji.

353
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:47,995
Kyung Joo, where are you?

354
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,095
Is it a special day?

355
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:53,060
It's an event.

356
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:56,135
- An event? - I guess he felt really bad.

357
00:24:56,732 --> 00:24:59,975
You have to look shocked as if you had no idea.

358
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:02,275
I don't like things like that.

359
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:10,415
You'll get drunk before they arrive.

360
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,555
Will you tell her today?

361
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:14,955
About what?

362
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,525
That you approached her with a purpose.

363
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:19,125
What for?

364
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,695
Yes. Why would you say that?

365
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,090
Then you, Hye Jeong, and Ko Kyung Joo...

366
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:26,565
It'll all be over.

367
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,135
I don't mind.

368
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:29,835
That's a lie.

369
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:31,605
Leave that card in play.

370
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,205
This evening will damage Tae Hee's ego enough.

371
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:39,415
They're here.

372
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,865
That was quick. Sit down.

373
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:03,205
Se Joo and I came over because Si Hyun insisted.

374
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,275
I guess he prepared a little something.

375
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,175
Soo Ji.

376
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:11,545
It isn't about you tonight, so how about you keep quiet?

377
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,415
You look so pretty tonight.

378
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:17,085
You too.

379
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,355
Thanks.

380
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:25,425
Si Hyun.

381
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,825
You brought us all here, so talk.

382
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:31,365
Doesn't Tae Hee look lovely?

383
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:48,015
Si Hyun, say something.

384
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:49,615
Isn't she lovely?

385
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:51,955
Don't.

386
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:55,325
Yes. She's pretty.

387
00:26:57,786 --> 00:26:59,895
I didn't know you were so pretty.

388
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:05,465
But...

389
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,335
you look uncomfortable.

390
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,805
Don't you feel out of place?

391
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,805
With us...

392
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:14,835
in this bar.

393
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,875
Your clothes, shoes, my friends, everything.

394
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:19,845
Si Hyun.

395
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:21,615
What's wrong with you?

396
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,315
I feel uncomfortable.

397
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:32,095
I'm sitting here looking at you,

398
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,125
and I feel uncomfortable.

399
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,365
When I told you to come over, I thought you'd refuse...

400
00:27:38,393 --> 00:27:40,665
or at least ask what the occasion was.

401
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:43,435
You rushed over without so much as a question.

402
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,705
Because you invited me.

403
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:50,300
I'm here because you, of all people, invited me.

404
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,115
I don't feel uncomfortable.

405
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:57,215
Seriously,

406
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,485
you and I are so different.

407
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:03,625
Where should I start describing our differences?

408
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,495
Si Hyun.

409
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:10,795
Don't pretend to be mean.

410
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:14,795
What are you trying to do to me?

411
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,605
I'm not pretending to be mean. I am mean.

412
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:23,575
I'm sick of pretending to be nice.

413
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:25,545
Let's stop it now.

414
00:28:28,243 --> 00:28:31,185
Why are you all keeping quiet?

415
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:39,095
Si Hyun.

416
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,655
I know what you're doing.

417
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,595
Stop. Let's talk in private.

418
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,765
You know what I'm doing?

419
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,035
What's that?

420
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:52,175
I don't know who my real father is. I don't want to know either.

421
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:55,875
Even Se Joo and Soo Ji don't know.

422
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:01,115
I hoped that no one would find out if that was ever possible.

423
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:03,085
No.

424
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:08,555
That's between you and me. I can't mention it here.

425
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:10,655
It's fine.

426
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,025
Say it.

427
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,075
Do you...

428
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:32,915
not like me...

429
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:35,215
anymore?

430
00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:11,015
(Tempted)

431
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:13,010
He's ignoring me completely.

432
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:15,680
No. He shouldn't show that he knows me.

433
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:16,680
It's over.

434
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:19,850
Do you think Si Hyun even liked Tae Hee?

435
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:21,790
Tae Hee will know that the best.

436
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,790
I just can't tell how people feel.

437
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,490
How could he do that if he liked her?

438
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,860
It's okay. Don't mention him from now on.

439
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,130
Will I die without a boyfriend?

440
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,100
You said you aren't angry. Why do you suddenly not like me?

441
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,975
Why did you hug me and cook me breakfast?

442
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:38,205
Kwon Si Hyun, you jerk!
