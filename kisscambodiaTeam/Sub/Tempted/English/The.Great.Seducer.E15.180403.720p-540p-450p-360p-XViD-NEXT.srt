1
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:09,312
Soo Ji.

2
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:14,017
Stop using our friendship as a weapon.

3
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:19,089
If you do this again,

4
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:24,261
I'm not sure if I can hold onto you again.

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,865
Your father is seeing someone else.

6
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,573
It seemed like they had a long history.

7
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:41,177
She's about his age. She's elegant. A woman everyone would like.

8
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:45,715
How am I supposed to stop my mom from marrying him?

9
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:46,783
Where did you see this?

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,652
How did you see him?

11
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:50,654
Listen to me. I'm talking about my mom.

12
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:51,955
Who is she?

13
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:55,425
Tell me.

14
00:00:57,627 --> 00:00:59,362
Why should I tell you?

15
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:03,733
"Our friendship"?

16
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,770
You're the one who shouldn't use...

17
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,105
our friendship as a weapon.

18
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:53,850
(Vice Chairman Kwon Seok Woo)

19
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,052
I heard the news. Are you okay?

20
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:57,921
I'm fine.

21
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,824
I can prepare for the big stuff with things like these.

22
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:02,759
There were no reporters, were there?

23
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:06,329
I told the marketing team to keep it out of social media.

24
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,834
Have you had dinner yet? Why don't we...

25
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,970
I'm waiting for someone to report to me. I have to go.

26
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,769
Let's go grab some soju.

27
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:48,638
I just...

28
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,608
hung up on Mr. Kwon too.

29
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,143
I'll just drive you there.

30
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,279
You want to know...

31
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,348
why Si Hyun moved out.

32
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,741
You're late.

33
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,743
Have you been waiting for me?

34
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,946
No, I can tell by your footsteps.

35
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,348
Gosh, you're like a puppy.

36
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,685
Was your mural tough to work on?

37
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,721
Your footsteps sounded rather weak.

38
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:42,926
I want some instant noodles.

39
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,128
What?

40
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,601
Hey, I should get this too.

41
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:56,673
My mom taught me that trick. She's a horrible cook.

42
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,814
Instant noodles and eggs. Awesome.

43
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,254
I love it when someone else cooks instant noodles for me.

44
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:14,691
I love that I'm eating this at your place.

45
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,494
No, you love it because you're here with me.

46
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,067
- What are you doing... - What?

47
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,268
in front of the fridge?

48
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,505
Nothing.

49
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,346
Why are you bringing rice from the fridge?

50
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,281
Cold rice is the best with instant noodles.

51
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,016
Why?

52
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:41,684
Well,

53
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,487
it's easy to understand if you think of osmotic effect.

54
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:47,724
Amloyse and amylopectin, which constitute starch in rice...

55
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,260
Hey, I have a headache.

56
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,428
Fine.

57
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:56,466
Okay, I'll remember that. Cold rice with instant noodles.

58
00:04:56,966 --> 00:05:00,737
Si Hyun's life knowledge just increased by one.

59
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,039
Wow, it looks really shiny now.

60
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,041
- You're good. - Right?

61
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:06,776
May I come over often?

62
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:10,079
Nonsense.

63
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:18,121
You call the time starlight gets to us as light years, right?

64
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,623
- Right. - But isn't that kind of sad?

65
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:26,195
Well, to be exact,

66
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:29,766
that's the distance which light travels in the vacuum for a year.

67
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,834
It's like AU and parsec, which are both astronomical units.

68
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,237
- It measures the distance... - Hey.

69
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:38,274
You know that I turn into a beast when my head hurts.

70
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:41,911
Okay, fine.

71
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:45,582
But what's sad about that?

72
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,183
Because...

73
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:49,919
someone will find out...

74
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,521
how much I shined,

75
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,222
how I smiled,

76
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:57,427
and what I talked about...

77
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,329
after a long time has passed.

78
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:05,702
Show and tell me everything right away, okay?

79
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:07,470
I'll be nearby,

80
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,105
so I can spot it immediately.

81
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:16,613
Really?

82
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,749
Is Si Hyun really not his biological son?

83
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:25,054
The vice chairman doesn't know that I know.

84
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,292
Why are you telling me this?

85
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,194
You need that information.

86
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,697
And this is all I can do for you.

87
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:40,136
It'll be interesting if Chairwoman Hong finds out.

88
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,641
She let him become a vice chairman that fast only because of Si Hyun.

89
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,846
Are you sure that no one knows?

90
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,315
Until Tiuzen passes the screening, until our wedding,

91
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,851
and until I can secure my rights by putting my name on...

92
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,220
the foundation, contracts, and shares,

93
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,688
this secret needs to be kept.

94
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,759
And we have to check and see if Si Hyun really isn't his son.

95
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:08,231
Mi Ri. Do you have to...

96
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:10,400
get married to him?

97
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,170
What kind of a question is that?

98
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,639
I hope you can meet someone you can be comfortable with.

99
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,342
Comfort? There are relationships...

100
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:21,844
that give you much more than that comfort.

101
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,046
Do you feel...

102
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,948
comfortable around me?

103
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:27,884
I doubt that.

104
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:30,153
I feel comfortable around you,

105
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,622
but you can't give me that comfort.

106
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,993
So don't tell me these things if you want to stop me.

107
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,747
What's with that look?

108
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:58,948
Everything has changed.

109
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:03,186
It's not the theater where we watched movies together.

110
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,654
And it's not where we ate together.

111
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:08,791
You're right.

112
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:12,328
I was thrilled on the way, but now, I'm sad.

113
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:17,166
Let's keep walking until we find a place that seems familiar.

114
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:18,968
Let's go.

115
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,075
I never knew places like these existed in Seoul.

116
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,545
People that tail me with Se Ri's orders only travel by car.

117
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,115
So I had to hide in these alleys.

118
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,517
It's pretty.

119
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:37,420
Just follow me. I know a lot of interesting places.

120
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:39,422
Hey.

121
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,270
Darn it, you almost got me, Se Joo.

122
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,638
How dare you try to fool me?

123
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,440
I didn't do anything.

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,975
You're not like Si Hyun.

125
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:01,911
You can make your eyes look like you're in love.

126
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,312
Is work taking a toll on you?

127
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,815
You have no one to flirt with after you bought that place, right?

128
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:06,883
Goodness.

129
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:09,418
I get it. You can at least take a breath during your speech.

130
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,822
How can you become a good cellist with such a dry heart?

131
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,791
What's he mumbling about?

132
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,626
Soo Ji is a Cancer,

133
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:19,662
and there is a Gemini right next to Cancer.

134
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,297
That means Se Joo is with her.

135
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,966
- They were both born in winter. - I see.

136
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:30,373
Apparently, Aries and Gemini have a similar pattern of living.

137
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,775
You and Se Joo are similar.

138
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:34,443
You're right.

139
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:37,146
I wake up at 12pm, and he wakes up at 1pm.

140
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:39,515
Then...

141
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,852
have you been waking up early because of me?

142
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:44,620
Me? When?

143
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:46,389
At first.

144
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,992
You waited for me early in the morning at the library,

145
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,661
and you woke up early...

146
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,896
even on the weekends when we visited the grannies.

147
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:57,099
Yes, I did that.

148
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,468
- You wanted to get on my good side? - What?

149
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,771
You wanted to get me to fall for you that badly?

150
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,807
Since when did you like me?

151
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,844
Come on, tell me.

152
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:09,912
I have no idea...

153
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:13,049
when I started liking you.

154
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:14,917
Gosh.

155
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,521
You can just say that it was love at first sight.

156
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:19,956
Don't be shy.

157
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:24,293
Where's my constellation?

158
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:28,331
- You can't see it now. - Why not?

159
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,333
Because yours appears in fall.

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,870
Did it come to its end? Has it died?

161
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,840
No, it's not like that.

162
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,176
You can see your constellation only in fall.

163
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,477
No, I'm telling you.

164
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:44,714
I was born in spring. It's my birthday soon.

165
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:47,116
What are you talking about? Why not?

166
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:49,752
It doesn't work like that.

167
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:52,555
You can only see it when fall comes.

168
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:53,789
I mean, why?

169
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,894
There's a street bar here?

170
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,162
How about some pork skin and soju?

171
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:03,099
You own a meat place, but you come here to get meat.

172
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,402
Ma'am, I'm here.

173
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,477
All right.

174
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,781
What's wrong?

175
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,355
Look over there discreetly.

176
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,029
Yes.

177
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,097
Have another one.

178
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:36,599
The woman sitting in front of him.

179
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,101
That's not my mom, right?

180
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,103
I don't think so.

181
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,079
I think I know who she is.

184
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,590
Who's that walking next to Tae Hee?

185
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,460
That's Tae Hee's mom. Don't they look alike?

186
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,096
Who is it?

187
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,266
Eun Tae Hee's mom.

188
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:21,944
This used to be a cafe that sold traditional tea.

189
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,155
Every single corner has changed.

190
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,091
But I haven't.

191
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,431
Yes. Your sickening cuteness and inability to drink are the same.

192
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,936
What has changed the least is how I feel.

193
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,773
It's the future that counts.

194
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,342
Won't you change?

195
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:55,611
No.

196
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:58,414
Let's not part ways.

197
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:00,883
Don't disappear again.

198
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:02,852
Okay, Young Won?

199
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,457
You bet.

200
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:23,806
Soo Ji.

201
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,509
Let's go home. You'll catch a cold.

202
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:30,846
Let's go home. I can't grill meat if I catch a cold.

203
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,919
(Madam Myung)

204
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,156
- What? - Where are you?

205
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,591
Why aren't you coming home or picking up?

206
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:45,261
I'll be home soon.

207
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,132
She sounds annoyingly happy.

208
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:00,076
Let's go.

209
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:07,183
I saw a man who looked about 20 painting.

210
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,919
I was very upset at the time.

211
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:13,989
But when I saw him painting,

212
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,826
I felt comforted somehow.

213
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,628
He looked happier than anyone.

214
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,797
Did he?

215
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:25,000
When I was in love with you,

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,237
feared nothing, and focused on making pottery,

217
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:30,606
I think that's how I looked.

218
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,811
Young Won, don't go home tonight.

219
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:38,948
We aren't dating.

220
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:42,685
- Don't go. - Geum Sil will have a fit.

221
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,221
Geum Sil can have a fit.

222
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:48,624
She needs to be shocked into dating herself.

223
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:52,628
I'll just look at you like this.

224
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:56,665
I mean it.

225
00:14:58,234 --> 00:14:59,568
Forget it.

226
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,275
I could still...

227
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,945
make you out of clay if I were told to.

228
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:12,915
I keep forgetting you.

229
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:15,384
That's why I must keep seeing you.

230
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,994
The smell of your cologne.

231
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:28,764
I spent quite a while on the first floor of...

232
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:32,067
a department store looking for this cologne.

233
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:36,138
I thought I could survive if I had this scent nearby.

234
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:40,442
That's how it was.

235
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,814
When I first met my husband,

236
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:47,950
I talked to him first.

237
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:52,254
"What cologne do you use?"

238
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:54,657
Now that we parted,

239
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,860
I feel sorry for him.

240
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:04,800
I was rushing up the stairs because I was late for a lecture,

241
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,903
and your mom was coming downstairs.

242
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:12,708
We just brushed past each other, but she came back, grabbed me,

243
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:14,310
and asked a question.

244
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,478
"What cologne do you use?"

245
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,281
So I said...

246
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,618
"I'll tell you if you buy me a cup of tea."

247
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:29,758
Where did I get the courage to say that?

248
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,394
Such a pretty lady randomly...

249
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,196
asked me what cologne I used.

250
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,166
Later on, I asked her why...

251
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,936
she liked a man much older and so very boring.

252
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,277
She said she wanted to keep seeing me because of my cologne.

253
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:54,550
You told the story too many times, and it still makes you happy?

254
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:58,354
You listened to it hundreds of times,

255
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,856
so I'll tell you a secret.

256
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:01,890
What is it?

257
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,225
That cologne.

258
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:07,396
It was a present from a postgraduate student who liked me.

259
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:08,597
What?

260
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,937
I like it best when you smell of coffee.

261
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:18,240
Me too.

262
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:22,344
Whenever I open that bottle of cologne, I think of Young Won.

263
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,514
It feels bittersweet.

264
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:37,493
I didn't know you used cologne.

265
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:39,094
I didn't know I had any.

266
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:41,497
My mom bought the same cologne my dad used for me.

267
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,934
Three marshmallows?

268
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,337
No, I don't like marshmallows.

269
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,712
I don't know if this smells nice.

270
00:17:57,112 --> 00:18:00,049
I don't like it either. It reminds me of my dad.

271
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,330
I like your natural smell.

272
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,700
That was so corny.

273
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,035
If Kyung Joo finds out...

274
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,137
I've changed, she wouldn't want to talk to me.

275
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:31,914
Take this to bed. I'm tired. I need to sleep.

276
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:34,249
I need to drink this first.

277
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,018
Take it to your place. Go on.

278
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:38,721
You're going to sleep until noon.

279
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:41,190
- I'm off. - Bye.

280
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,292
Weirdo.

281
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,124
Is this not it?

282
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:27,703
What?

283
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,038
Smile.

284
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:32,775
- What? - Smile for me.

285
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,178
Like this?

286
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,380
What for?

287
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:42,184
I couldn't remember what your smile looked like.

288
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,523
Don't forget.

289
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,792
I'll smile for you properly just once.

290
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:50,859
Okay.

291
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,371
What do you want?

292
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,706
- Hello. - The usual.

293
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,108
Thanks.

294
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,912
One jasmine pearl tea and...

295
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,747
- a grapefruite-ade. - Okay.

296
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,415
- Nice and cold. - Sure.

297
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:25,494
Sorry. I'm an artist too, so I got curious.

298
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:26,962
It's fine.

299
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30,499
I like your drawing.

300
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,503
Did you paint the wall outside?

301
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:35,804
How did you know?

302
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:37,506
I saw you paint it.

303
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,843
I just splashed paint on it.

304
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,981
Can I ask who that is?

305
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,719
She looks a lot like someone I know.

306
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,423
You must like her a lot.

307
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:57,192
It shows in the drawing.

308
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,028
Yes.

309
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:01,964
It's my girlfriend.

310
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,707
Soo Ji.

311
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:13,976
Pick for me.

312
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,349
- Where are you going? - A JK meeting and then a date.

313
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,751
This.

314
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,353
I knew it.

315
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,124
You should join us.

316
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,327
Si Hyun will be there. Let's have lunch together.

317
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,196
Why Si Hyun?

318
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,933
I think he has something to discuss with his dad.

319
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,138
Did you two fight? Why don't you know about it?

320
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:45,807
No, we didn't.

321
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:48,310
I'm going to school. There's so much I need to practice.

322
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,345
Look at you, Soo Ji.

323
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,714
You've been practicing so hard lately. I'm so proud of you.

324
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:54,983
I don't have a choice.

325
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,020
If nothing goes my way, I'll have to go abroad to study.

326
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,322
What? What do you mean?

327
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:03,759
I'm going to wash up.

328
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:06,895
Okay. I'm going to work now.

329
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,936
Good morning. Here's your breakfast.

330
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:18,273
Did Mom...

331
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,309
have breakfast?

332
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:23,979
No, she hasn't been able to eat lately.

333
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:27,249
I don't have an appetite either.

334
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,526
Hey, you're up early.

335
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:39,628
I just wanted to.

336
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:42,364
Are you going somewhere?

337
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:44,399
My dad wanted to see me.

338
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,137
I'm going to go now.

339
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,015
The doors are closing.

340
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,325
Square your shoulders.

341
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:36,852
Thanks to your act, our stocks have been fluctuating up and down.

342
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:39,788
I only asked you not to cause trouble. Is that so hard?

343
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,456
It's not true.

344
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:45,127
You would know since you probably checked it with President Myung.

345
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:46,895
Whether it's true or not,

346
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:48,764
the fact that you provided the cause is the problem.

347
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,536
I was wondering why you wanted to see me.

348
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:57,072
You wanted other people to see that I was fine.

349
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,975
Stay out of trouble for your own good.

350
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:03,378
What do you think the chairwoman will do when she finds out?

351
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:04,913
I don't care if she does.

352
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:06,214
What?

353
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:09,618
You're worried that I might tell her that we're not biologically related.

354
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:11,486
That would lose ground at the company.

355
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,958
I told you not to ask any questions.

356
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,294
I didn't. I don't have any questions for you.

357
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:22,998
Even if it meant that I had to be dead, I wanted to ask Mom...

358
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:24,800
who my real father was.

359
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,102
But why should I care?

360
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:29,538
I'm a useless human being anyway.

361
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,206
I'm glad you know.

362
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,242
But there is one thing I would like to find out.

363
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:38,080
The woman you are seeing right now.

364
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:42,217
And the person responsible for my mom's death.

365
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,054
You're the one who must be careful.

366
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:48,890
You're about to get hitched,

367
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,226
but you're seeing your first love because you're not over her.

368
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,696
Imagine how much fun the tabloids will have at this news.

369
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:04,973
You must be bored and have a lot of time on your hands.

370
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,909
Yes, to the point where I want to age quickly so that I could die.

371
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:12,013
I'm sure Mom was feeling the same while she lived with you.

372
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:16,051
But President Myung shouldn't be subjected to the same feeling.

373
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:19,621
She got egged for JK Group in front of her daughter.

374
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:23,925
That's why I will find out who she is by all means.

375
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:27,195
Don't do anything stupid.

376
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:29,531
Keep an eye on me to see what I do.

377
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,033
I can reveal...

378
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,136
the truth of our relationship.

379
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,204
It will be your loss.

380
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:38,807
Well, I can't be saved anyway.

381
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:43,478
Did you two have a child together?

382
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:44,946
If you do,

383
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:47,716
someone would share the same miserable fate as me.

384
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,263
Si Hyun, I understand that you feel wronged.

385
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:03,331
I watched you get treated at the hospital.

386
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:05,433
Are you all right?

387
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:10,172
Getting tested would be the fastest way to silence the drug rumor.

388
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,974
How about publicly getting the test at our hospital?

389
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:17,879
You want him to get through his physical checkup publicly?

390
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,483
Some politicians do it to get rid of suspicions regarding military duty.

391
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:23,518
It may not be easy for Si Hyun,

392
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,487
but this is the best way to make the rumor go away.

393
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:28,523
No, there's no need for that.

394
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,692
But people will continue to suspect him.

395
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:32,494
It doesn't matter.

396
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,697
I guess he's worried about something.

397
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:37,933
In case a secret gets revealed or something.

398
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:40,268
I'll leave now.

399
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,887
Shareholders are worried that FDA might consider public's sentiment...

400
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:01,590
and won't pass the proposal since this is a drug rumor.

401
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:04,359
Some speculations that it might tie to politics are brought up too.

402
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:07,229
It's not like we bribed the board.

403
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:11,032
How about asking Mr. Kim to elucidate the misunderstanding?

404
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,101
No.

405
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:17,005
Mr. Kim's involvement will only confirm their suspicion.

406
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,475
Sharing the burden with Mr. Kim won't be good either.

407
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,345
But if we explain the misunderstanding,

408
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:25,080
will it calm the public?

409
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:31,953
I will hold a press conference and handle it.

410
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:35,056
It's better for Myoungjeong to handle this instead of JK Group.

411
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,591
Will you be okay?

412
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:41,129
An expert's explanation will lessen their disapproval.

413
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:47,335
I will have the conference at Myoungjeong Bio Research Center.

414
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:51,673
Thank you.

415
00:27:57,545 --> 00:28:00,448
It's the amended list of employees for the business department.

416
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,220
With all due respect, I don't think her involvement would be best.

417
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,490
The merger hasn't happened yet.

418
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,559
If she gets involved in this matter which is clearly JK's problem,

419
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,229
people will perceive your marriage as a business move.

420
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:19,034
It may lose its reputation as a hospital of social contribution.

421
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:20,869
The proposal for the funding regarding the research center...

422
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,470
won't be passed.

423
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,811
(Amended List of Employees)

424
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:36,718
What is it? Are you tired?

425
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,955
No.

426
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:44,359
I think we should reconsider the press conference.

427
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:46,561
Don't overdo yourself.

428
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:48,763
And...

429
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:50,665
I'll look over this later.

430
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,347
Tae Hee, I'm here to apologize. Please accept my apology.

431
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,049
I definitely crossed the line that day.

432
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:11,686
Here's your drink, sir.

433
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:14,422
You're breaking my heart.

434
00:29:22,097 --> 00:29:25,367
This is great. It's tastier because you made it for me.

435
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:27,502
Please enjoy your drink at your table.

436
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:30,572
I'm still on the clock, and this is a place of work.

437
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:32,974
If you have something to say, you'll have to wait until I'm done.

438
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:34,509
I'm the only customer here.

439
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,344
I'll wait.

440
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,583
I was just worried about you. Si Hyun seemed to bother you too.

441
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:44,052
Why would you worry about me?

442
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:45,720
I can take care of myself.

443
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,757
Besides, what do you know about Si Hyun?

444
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,595
Do you know that he was treated at the hospital...

445
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:54,996
because of his drug use?

446
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,765
The news is all over town.

447
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:58,867
Look it up. There are articles with his initials.

448
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:05,740
That's not true. Did you see it yourself?

449
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,776
It's a rumor, not a fact.

450
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,778
Right.

451
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,881
But why are you defending him?

452
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:15,784
I just... I wasn't defending anyone.

453
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,020
Ki Young.

454
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:22,490
I thought you'd be a good officer of the law.

455
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:24,526
But I was wrong.

456
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:28,129
Someone who spreads rumors doesn't deserve to practice the law.

457
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:36,704
(To Si Hyun: Did you have lunch?)

458
00:30:57,225 --> 00:30:58,827
Nothing happened to me.

459
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:04,099
I just wanted to hug you.

460
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:09,904
It's nice.

461
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:11,940
Being hugged.

462
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:17,879
You can tell me anything.

463
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:21,749
I'm fine.

464
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:24,786
Except that you're fine.

465
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,057
Thank you.
