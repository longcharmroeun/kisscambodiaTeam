00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:09,145
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,455
- Can you pass me more radish? - You have to put this in too.

3
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:27,830
It feels like the morning sun rose in this Twilight Home.

4
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:30,035
People like him are what we call an eye candy.

5
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,405
Just looking at him makes me feel so happy.

6
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:42,310
Why did you bring your hot boyfriend just now?

7
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:44,155
He's not my boyfriend.

8
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:46,750
You need to take this too.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,095
This is a singing class with Tae Hee.

10
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,525
- All right. - You're adorable.

11
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,865
What's so bad about my age?

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,900
There is no age restriction in love

13
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:11,375
I think that when I look at myself

14
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:19,655
One day, by accident, I got to see

15
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:22,710
What I look like in a mirror

16
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,255
She gets to do the fun part.

17
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:30,895
My age is the perfect age to love

18
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,035
She's pretty when she smiles.

19
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,665
I must be insane.

20
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:36,505
I'm seeing things now.

21
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,745
Soo Ji.

22
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:46,440
- I think I'm about to die. - What now? What is it?

23
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:48,045
Let's come up with a different plan.

24
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:51,915
I don't think this is right. This place is weird.

25
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,810
- What's with you two? - Can you put me on anesthesia?

26
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,255
- No, I can't. Stay still. - Seriously?

27
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,665
My gosh, wait. Soo Ji.

28
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:03,835
Sit upright.

29
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,035
I gave this a thought and...

30
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:09,565
Hello?

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,035
I should just run away...

32
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,605
What are you trying to do with Tae Hee?

33
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:16,745
Pardon?

34
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,100
I was just here to carry some cabbage around.

35
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,945
Don't try to lie to her.

36
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:23,115
She used to be a shaman.

37
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,785
- Kid. - Yes?

38
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:34,825
My goodness.

39
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,195
You'll make people pay for your handsomeness.

40
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:39,420
I'm just a friend.

41
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,765
A friend? That's such a waste of time.

42
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,405
Does he look okay?

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,535
Let me see your ears.

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,705
My ears?

45
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,440
Tae Hee said she goes to Seoul National University.

46
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,370
Do you go to the same school?

47
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:56,270
I'm not attending anywhere.

48
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,115
Goodness, Tae Hee is such a smart girl.

49
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:01,985
- Then you're out. - What's bad about cabbage delivery?

50
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:03,080
- Cabbage delivery? - Kid.

51
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,120
- Yes? - You should live with confidence.

52
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,625
Guys are all about their looks.

53
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:07,925
Yes, looks.

54
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:15,290
That's true.

55
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:16,975
A diploma is good for nothing.

56
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,935
Even when a woman feels frustrated,

57
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,030
it only takes a face like this, a chest like this,

58
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:22,845
and buttocks like these...

59
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,740
to make her feel better at an instant.

60
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:26,075
Of course.

61
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,915
What just happened to me?

62
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,925
This is so wrong.

63
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:39,620
- My gosh. - You. Forsythia.

64
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:40,765
Pardon?

65
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:42,925
Did you just say the F word?

66
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,295
Forsythia.

67
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,775
Oh, the flower. Forsythia.

68
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,735
Yes.

69
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:56,845
All right. I'm all finished. Look.

70
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:05,615
Where have you been?

71
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:09,285
- Pardon? - Why did you come just now?

72
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,295
I thought you were dead all along.

73
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:21,065
What's going on? Why is she crying?

74
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:24,635
She wanted me to draw forsythia, so I did, and...

75
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,775
You can't do this without asking.

76
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,875
Grandma, it's okay.

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,975
I'll make another one for you.

78
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:36,085
He left.

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,880
He picked a flower for me, then left just like that.

80
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:41,450
Ma'am.

81
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,595
You thought of your husband again.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,355
You've been seeing him quite often.

83
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,665
I think I did something.

84
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:51,495
What? It's not like that.

85
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:53,035
Don't worry about it.

86
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,865
She's been like this lately.

87
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:58,135
He must've been surprised. You should go get some rest.

88
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,805
Let's go. Stop provoking her.

89
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,775
Honey, where are you going again?

90
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,385
One second.

91
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,255
I'll be back soon.

92
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:17,595
I'm going to go for now, but I'll be back soon.

93
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:21,025
- Okay. - I promise.

94
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,465
Okay.

95
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,560
- Goodness. - Thanks for the food.

96
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,470
- Enjoy. - Sure, thanks.

97
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,705
- Thank you. - Great job today.

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,315
- Thank you. - Sure.

99
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,770
Here. Take some.

100
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,870
No, we're fine.

101
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,240
Why? You should take some.

102
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,840
We made delicious kimchi thanks to you two.

103
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,255
- Really? - I'll take that.

104
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,210
- Be careful. - It's heavy.

105
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:51,480
You should dress more casually next time.

106
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,055
Don't wear a black coat.

107
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,350
We look the same.

108
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,550
Come on, Father.

109
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,295
- Goodbye, then. - Bye.

110
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,360
- Have a safe trip. - Goodbye.

111
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,890
- Goodbye. - Great job today.

112
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:02,105
- Bye. - Goodbye.

113
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,265
Goodbye.

114
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,870
- Come again. - Goodbye.

115
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,905
- Bye. - Thank you.

116
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,415
I'll let you off this once.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,295
- Where... - So...

118
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,405
You first.

119
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,165
Never mind.

120
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,985
This is it.

121
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,425
Oh, I see. Okay.

122
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:33,055
Bye.

123
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,025
Eun Tae Hee.

124
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,065
Shall we...

125
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,935
eat something?

126
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:48,205
I'm not sure.

127
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,175
Bye, then.

128
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,585
- Hey. - What?

129
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,455
- Eat this. - My goodness.

130
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:08,125
I don't need kimchi. I'll move into a dorm soon.

131
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:11,795
Then I'll call instead of waiting at the bus stop.

132
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,505
No, don't.

133
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:16,760
Sorry if I got the wrong idea about you.

134
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,775
And sorry if I was too harsh.

135
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:22,745
But... I won't date you.

136
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:27,015
Do you dislike me that much?

137
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,345
Well...

138
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:31,955
It's...

139
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:36,085
My friend likes you.

140
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,625
What about you?

141
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,095
How...

142
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,095
do you feel?

143
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,935
It came on.

144
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,045
Thanks for the kimchi.

145
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,005
Go on home. It's cold.

146
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,580
It was a spectacle.

147
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:15,325
They drew blood for a physical, and he's half-dead.

148
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:19,195
It was more than this much. The world spun around me.

149
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,765
I asked my mom to get him to come out.

150
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,435
Come on over.

151
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,700
I'm tired.

152
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,805
I'll eat and then sleep for two days.

153
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:32,775
Did you not eat together because I told you not to?

154
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:35,885
- Good for you, Si Hyun. - Yes, good for me.

155
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,455
The grannies just love me.

156
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,350
You should do that much for me,

157
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:48,850
- don't you think? - I did my hair.

158
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,025
It's pretty.

159
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,795
Oh, right. Kyung Joo likes Se Joo.

160
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:54,765
Isn't that incredible?

161
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,105
My friend likes you.

162
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:03,745
That was Se Joo, not me?

163
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,415
How have you been, Se Joo?

164
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,610
I was a bit sick.

165
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,025
I see.

166
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,155
No wonder. You look slightly different.

167
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,565
Her hair.

168
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:26,795
Se Joo, it's been a while.

169
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,205
Han Na.

170
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,630
- Were you away? - I was traveling.

171
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,330
You're tanned.

172
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,640
How do you look even sexier?

173
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,145
- Are they your friends? - Yes.

174
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,685
Let's get a drink.

175
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,995
"500cc of boiling water".

176
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:02,205
How would I know how much water that is?

177
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,235
That's it.

178
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:22,985
Hello?

179
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,455
Hey.

180
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:27,350
Do you know how much water 500cc is?

181
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:28,825
You're cooking noodles?

182
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,550
Yes.

183
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,495
Ready and go.

184
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,065
Stop.

185
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:39,935
- Is it boiling? - Yes.

186
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:43,445
Put the seasoning in first.

187
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:44,875
Seasoning in.

188
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,375
The dried flakes.

189
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:49,270
Snap the noodles in half first,

190
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:50,645
and it tastes better.

191
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:53,840
Are your noodles cooking already?

192
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:54,985
Yes.

193
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:59,455
My gas cooker isn't as powerful and takes some time.

194
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:02,450
- Are you keeping up? - Of course.

195
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,635
Do you have a 500ml carton of milk?

196
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,565
Yes, I bought one today.

197
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:09,565
Use that as a measuring cup.

198
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,635
I'm such an idiot.

199
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,905
I'm not good at measuring water either.

200
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,745
Enjoy your noodles.

201
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:22,485
What?

202
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,855
Okay. You too.

203
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,325
She can't hang up. She just can't.

204
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,595
(Eun Tae Hee)

205
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,765
Gosh, it's amazing.

206
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,300
I don't get it.

207
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,305
She rejected me because of Kyung Joo?

208
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,025
We should've eaten together.

209
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:05,455
I want noodles too.

210
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,325
- Cheers. - Cheers.

211
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:13,620
What are you doing?

212
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,435
My mom let me go out. Can you spend time with me?

213
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:21,405
Why does she talk like that? I can't stand it.

214
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,875
Sure. When?

215
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,970
You should drink more. Bottoms up.

216
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,570
- You're hardcore. - Bottoms up.

217
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:32,980
My gosh. He's so happy he's free from his family's grasp.

218
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:36,010
- A love shot? Sure. - I should've left with Kyung Joo.

219
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:38,780
Of course, here's your snack. Now, feed me too.

220
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:40,825
- Quick, quick. - My goodness.

221
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:42,425
I'm leaving.

222
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,735
It's so tasty, Han Na.

223
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,165
- By the way... - What?

224
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,800
- It's amazing. - Was it tasty?

225
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,005
You're the best, of course.

226
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,815
You're leaving already?

227
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,275
Move.

228
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:01,645
I know a nice place.

229
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,080
Let go while you can. My hands mean a lot to me.

230
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,840
Come along with me.

231
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,385
I said let go.

232
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,655
Will you let go?

233
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:19,135
- What was that? - What just happened?

234
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:23,490
- Wasn't that too much? - What happened?

235
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,635
- What happened? - He got punched?

236
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,345
- Shouldn't we report this? - Go on.

237
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:30,915
Let go.

238
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,075
He's dead.

239
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:36,745
Thank you.

240
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:41,185
Why did you get involved? You hate violence.

241
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,410
Look at me.

242
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:44,295
Should I have sat and watched?

243
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,225
It was my chance to get beaten up.

244
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,460
How many times should I see a doctor?

245
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:54,690
I wish he'd punched out a molar.

246
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,365
You idiot.

247
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,970
I mean, you get beaten up at home.

248
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,915
I'm upset that you got beaten up in public too.

249
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:06,515
Did that hurt?

250
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:12,140
Will you please hit me where it'll show?

251
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:15,250
Look at my ribs. They're just fine.

252
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,980
What should I do? I'm so stocky.

253
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,555
I'm not even in pain.

254
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,225
This is unbelievable.

255
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,225
Hey.

256
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,530
Go straight home, okay?

257
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,035
Okay, okay.

258
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,370
Put that on your wrist.

259
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:37,400
Put it on yours. I'm fine.

260
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:40,615
Do as I say. I know what I'm saying. That'll hurt in the morning.

261
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,440
Go straight home. Don't get beaten up again.

262
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,855
I said I won't.

263
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,185
Drive safely.

264
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:50,785
Go.

265
00:15:58,727 --> 00:15:59,935
Rice.

266
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,590
Your hair will get into the food.

267
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,235
Slow down.

268
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,770
How could he not notice this?

269
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:11,575
- Did he not notice the perm? - No.

270
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:13,300
But in that dark club,

271
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,570
he noticed a girl with big breasts had gotten a tan.

272
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:16,770
What did I say?

273
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,140
- Men... - Are visual beings.

274
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:20,985
If they care, they'll notice...

275
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,225
You cut your hair.

276
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:23,685
It's cute.

277
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,195
Things.

278
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:27,550
So you said.

279
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:31,695
I bet he'll be laughing as he moves around the club.

280
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,430
No. He's eating noodles.

281
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,665
What?

282
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:37,775
Are you dreaming?

283
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,400
You met him today?

284
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:42,345
Yes. Do you have any kimchi?

285
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:45,000
It can't be.

286
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,000
He's eating noodles at home.

287
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,170
What are you saying?

288
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:51,455
How do you know if Lee Se Joo's drinking or eating noodles?

289
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,115
Lee Se Joo?

290
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:54,485
Hey.

291
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,225
- It's not Kwon Si Hyun? - What?

292
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,495
The guy you like is...

293
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:01,865
- Hey. - My gosh.

294
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:05,595
I told you that I like the most handsome guy there.

295
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,960
Do you think Si Hyun is the most handsome guy there?

296
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:17,030
Hey, ask anyone on the streets. With this picture?

297
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,875
I had a crush on him for three years.

298
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,745
Okay, fine.

299
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:24,145
What will you do about Se Joo?

300
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:28,350
What can I do? I guess this hairstyle wasn't his type.

301
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,510
Hey, that's not right.

302
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,580
What's important is that you like your hairstyle. Don't get it done.

303
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,150
No, forget it.

304
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,620
And even if I did like Si Hyun,

305
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:40,690
why do you care? If you like him, that's enough.

306
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:43,205
- You cried over him. - That's because...

307
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:46,535
Anyway, don't use me as an excuse.

308
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,105
How do you feel?

309
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:53,115
I've never seen you interested in someone before.

310
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,585
How do you feel?

311
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:02,485
What about you?

312
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,225
How...

313
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,225
do you feel?

314
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,465
My heart feels a bit lighter.

315
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:40,725
I'm here.

316
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,145
You must've forgotten how cute your youngest son looks.

317
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,815
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,125
I've been a bit busy.

319
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:12,355
I mean, your son is way too popular.

320
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,125
You know that.

321
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,575
I'm going to sleep next to you tonight.

322
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,345
Mom.

323
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,615
I punched someone today.

324
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,025
Am I like Dad?

325
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,555
I really hate it.

326
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,765
I didn't even cover you up.

327
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,205
Your son made a mistake, didn't he?

328
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,245
Mom.

329
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:15,585
Can you get up...

330
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:18,855
and give me a scolding?

331
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,830
Get it checked after your lesson.

332
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,315
This is enough.

333
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,515
Do you want to study abroad?

334
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,245
I'll let you go if you want.

335
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:45,555
Everything will be settled once you return.

336
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,385
You would have everything you want,

337
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:53,055
but I would have lost everything. That's what you call settled, right?

338
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:58,695
You wouldn't lose everything.

339
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:03,265
Don't you know? I'm trying hard to protect everything you have.

340
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:05,375
Se Joo got hurt because of me.

341
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,505
Tell their secretaries to get him to a hospital.

342
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:10,630
And it looks like Hye Jeong needs a math tutor.

343
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,575
You should give her the number of my old tutor.

344
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,145
What are you doing?

345
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:17,145
Making a deal with you. You told me not to be late today.

346
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,715
It's not that. What have you been up to?

347
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,210
Being sociable. Building friendship. Making friends. Things like these.

348
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:25,655
People would only come over when we throw a party.

349
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,525
My friends would only come when I give them presents.

350
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,225
That's how it's always been.

351
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:34,965
I'll show you...

352
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,735
that you can have everything you want...

353
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,635
without doing such work if you have power.

354
00:21:51,947 --> 00:21:54,315
It's cold today. Why didn't you come inside?

355
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,185
You treat me as if I'm your sister.

356
00:21:56,952 --> 00:21:58,155
Show me your hand.

357
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:02,865
Are you okay? Doesn't it hurt?

358
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,795
This is what we call normal.

359
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:08,905
Asking me if I'm okay first, not what happened.

360
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:11,700
I heard someone hit on Se Joo, so you punched that girl.

361
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,235
- What? - Let's go.

362
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:16,805
Let's go.

363
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:37,325
- I don't want to be hungry later. - Sure, eat up.

364
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,835
- Are you coming? - No, I have to go somewhere.

365
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,235
She told me to study abroad.

366
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:48,805
She said everything will be settled once I get back.

367
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:52,875
Do you think my mom...

368
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,085
and your dad really like each other?

369
00:22:56,378 --> 00:23:00,415
In that case, we probably can be siblings who are best friends.

370
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:03,685
That's because you don't know my mom.

371
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:07,990
Why? Does it sound great to get the prettiest,

372
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,325
younger sister in this world?

373
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:14,665
Why? Did you give up on becoming the prettiest wife in the universe?

374
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,830
- Darn you. - My gosh.

375
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,760
Look what you've done. Be careful with your hand.

376
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,305
You and your temper.

377
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,845
It's all because...

378
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,015
you say those things like they're nothing.

379
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:27,975
You looked so depressed before.

380
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,645
Don't feel bad for me...

381
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,285
because of your mom.

382
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,785
I get it.

383
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:39,355
You make sure you don't get on your dad's bad side.

384
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:41,625
I'll try my best to stop my mom.

385
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:43,125
Okay.

386
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:45,335
You might really get kicked out.

387
00:23:49,231 --> 00:23:50,935
What kind of a conversation is this?

388
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,945
Nothing changed even after we turned 20.

389
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,345
All right. Good job.

390
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,070
May I give you a hand?

391
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,115
Sure.

392
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:08,185
Is the cabbage guy not here with you today?

393
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:11,185
- The cabbage guy? - Your boyfriend.

394
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,350
He's not my boyfriend.

395
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:18,060
Did you two fight? Put him on the phone.

396
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,995
She can't call him first.

397
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:22,565
Don't call him first.

398
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:26,835
Is it because we gave him a hard time for not going to college?

399
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:31,005
He had milky-white, soft skin and was very pretty.

400
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:34,275
- His ears were pretty too. - One moment.

401
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,970
He's coming, he's not coming

402
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:40,055
You can't count while you draw to tell if he's coming or not.

403
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,285
- Is that so? - Goodness.

404
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,755
He is coming. He's coming. He is.

405
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:00,935
It's so pretty.

406
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:18,455
The restaurant is this way.

407
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:25,995
You're right on time.

408
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:28,905
Isn't it too quiet in here?

409
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:31,975
It would be so awkward when silence kicks in.

410
00:25:37,606 --> 00:25:39,515
Your exhibition is almost over.

411
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,475
The flowers are wilting.

412
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,215
- And your daughter never came by. - She doesn't need to.

413
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm just thankful that she's there.

414
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,980
What are you thankful for? She only hurts you when she comes.

415
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:52,995
At least she can vent out her anger.

416
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:55,825
She should cry, laugh,

417
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,495
and scream.

418
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,465
I'm glad that she began to do that.

419
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:07,335
A traumatic experience isn't something very huge.

420
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,705
One day, it just happens.

421
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:12,575
You get fixated on a certain wound.

422
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:17,545
You can't go forward or backward. You get stuck,

423
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,415
and you don't know what to do.

424
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:24,755
That's what happened to her when I divorced her dad...

425
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:28,625
and when she came back to Korea by herself.

426
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:30,795
And when...

427
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,490
that car accident broke out because of me.

428
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:35,905
It's not because of you.

429
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:37,535
It was just an accident.

430
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,845
So when Tae Hee comes by and says those harsh things to me,

431
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,605
I'm rather thankful.

432
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:48,045
It's very important to say goodbye properly to everything. Right?

433
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,515
Stop thinking about how your daughter feels.

434
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:54,685
You should take care of your own heart too.

435
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:58,155
Let's call it a day.

436
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,625
Why comfort me now?

437
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:07,795
I forgot all about it already.

438
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:21,245
Young Won.

439
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:39,295
Let's call him a bit later. Maybe something urgent came up.

440
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,605
I need to step outside.

441
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,535
I won't leave.

442
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:10,525
Hello.

443
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:12,695
You might fall over.

444
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,995
Why did you come here?

445
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:51,435
You sent them?

446
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:55,705
Should I not address you like that?

447
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,675
I wanted to come over.

448
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:00,075
I sent them.

449
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,585
Have some tea.

450
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:07,985
Young Won.

451
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,435
I missed you.

452
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:30,145
So much.

453
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:34,175
Why did you come over today?

454
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:41,785
Right. You promised the old lady you'd come back.

455
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:55,965
I'm here...

456
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,435
because I want to know how you feel.

457
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:08,445
I don't know what kind of person you are.

458
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:22,725
Don't you want to find out?

459
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,735
I do want to,

460
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,305
but I'm afraid.

461
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:34,735
Me too.

462
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:37,705
I'm afraid.

463
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:40,745
Why?

464
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:45,555
In case...

465
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,555
I'll do you wrong.

466
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:58,695
I'm sorry.

467
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:03,950
(Tempted)

468
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,620
I'll wait and take you home.

469
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:07,790
Shall I carry you? Wait for me.

470
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,190
You like it.

471
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:11,260
Could he tell that my heart skipped a beat?

472
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:14,560
We parted ways 20 years ago and missed our chance many times.

473
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:17,130
- It's not meant to be. - But we met again.

474
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:20,800
Did I just find out that you like me?

475
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,145
Oh, well...

476
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:24,045
You can take your time.

477
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,315
I think...

478
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,015
I like you.

479
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,985
Won't you regret it?
