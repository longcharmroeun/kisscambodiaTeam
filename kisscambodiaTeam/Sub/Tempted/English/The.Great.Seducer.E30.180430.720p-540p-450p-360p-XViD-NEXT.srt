00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:08,411
(Episode 30)

2
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:54,524
How's Tae Hee? Is she okay?

3
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:57,594
She won't talk to me.

4
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:00,997
Sorry to call you here like this.

5
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:02,932
Don't say that.

6
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,102
How are you? Are you doing okay?

7
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:09,773
Go on inside.

8
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:14,377
Honey.

9
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:19,883
Look after Tae Hee for me.

10
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,153
Don't worry.

11
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,133
What beautiful weather.

12
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:14,137
Thanks to you, I saw your mom and got to enjoy a drive.

13
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:16,139
It's nice.

14
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,341
Dad.

15
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:21,378
I'm going to Germany with you.

16
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:25,515
Okay.

17
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,617
I checked how to take a break from school.

18
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:29,986
Okay.

19
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:31,955
What kind of answer is that?

20
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:35,024
I'm sure you thought about it before making the decision.

21
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:38,862
You can always go back to your studies later on.

22
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,397
Or start over.

23
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:43,633
You won't ask me why?

24
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,668
No, I won't ask.

25
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:50,306
I think answering that will make you feel sad.

26
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:55,712
I just wonder if you made the call with a happy heart.

27
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:57,647
That's my concern.

28
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,984
But then again, even if you didn't,

29
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:03,987
you can always change your mind later.

30
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,691
Breaking up with Mom turned you into a philosopher.

31
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:12,362
I saw you...

32
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,899
smile at Mom earlier.

33
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,468
How can you smile at her?

34
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:21,204
I'm not entirely sure.

35
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,941
I guess it's because you can't hide the fact...

36
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,277
that you like someone.

37
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:30,547
Your feelings are like muscles.

38
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:35,151
When the good feelings you had for someone become stronger,

39
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:37,887
you can't move any other way.

40
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:42,826
It's as if your body remembers how you felt when you liked them.

41
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:45,929
It makes you move in that direction.

42
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:48,231
I can't ignore that yet.

43
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,667
I'll take my time...

44
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,636
and wait until it disappears.

45
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:56,506
If it doesn't disappear,

46
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,008
then that can't be helped.

47
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,719
(Mr. Choi)

48
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,026
I traced Ryu Joo An's whereabouts...

49
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,295
and found a place Park Hye Jeong could be at.

50
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:20,697
Somewhere in Seoul?

51
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:23,566
Where else could she have gone?

52
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:27,704
Yes, but the building belongs to Joosung.

53
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,807
Joosung?

54
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,576
Okay, thanks.

55
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,712
Text me the address.

56
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,348
If she's not at a hotel in Seoul,

57
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:41,117
search the whole country until you find her!

58
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,153
She left home days ago, and you still haven't found her?

59
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,556
Search as if you're looking for lice. Do it.

60
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,657
Don't.

61
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,195
Do you want me to be happy...

62
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:54,464
or marry Lee Ki Young?

63
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:58,635
Mom, you saw him hit Kyu Jeong and me.

64
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:01,037
He's not even a human being!

65
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:11,147
- Will you stop it? - Hey, that's enough.

66
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:12,849
Seriously?

67
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:19,289
Get your hands off him!

68
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,524
I was just...

69
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:25,328
fooling around with a friend. Why are you overreacting?

70
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,935
I am officially breaking off the engagement.

71
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:33,736
Pardon?

72
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,473
Ma'am.

73
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,476
I'll tell my family what Hye Jeong has been up to.

74
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,912
Go ahead. Tell them she has a boyfriend...

75
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,481
and that she ran away from home.

76
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,784
Tell them, you fool.

77
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,853
The way you abuse other people's children...

78
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,522
shows what your family's like.

79
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,591
It's best I found out and broke it off now.

80
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:59,329
You will regret this, ma'am.

81
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,198
My family will retaliate.

82
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,077
Kyu Jeong.

83
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:16,045
My poor Kyu Jeong.

84
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:30,727
About the parking lot incident...

85
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:32,895
I'm sorry about that.

86
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:35,965
I got riled up and crossed the line.

87
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:37,467
It's fine.

88
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,803
I didn't come here for an apology.

89
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:45,308
We aren't friends anyway, so I won't get hurt.

90
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:49,145
Did you apologize to Si Hyun?

91
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:52,348
You two were friends.

92
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:54,117
I bet he was hurt.

93
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:56,653
We were friends?

94
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,856
I guess...

95
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:03,126
you won't be friends now.

96
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,562
I'm not sure if you heard,

97
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,932
but I found out how you three...

98
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,301
toyed around with me.

99
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:17,507
You toyed with me according to the plan you set up.

100
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,409
Because of that plan,

101
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,678
your mom's evil past came to light.

102
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,447
Si Hyun, the person who meant the most to you, left you.

103
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,416
How does that feel?

104
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,887
Considering what you did to me,

105
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,123
can't you tell me that much?

106
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:38,528
You used me like a toy.

107
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:42,098
How does it feel to beg regarding what your mom did?

108
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:44,667
I'm curious.

109
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,438
- But... - I know everything.

110
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,274
I know, so stop it.

111
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,577
Don't be scared.

112
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,646
I won't be like you...

113
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:59,148
and hold that against you as a weakness.

114
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:01,484
But I do want you to suffer...

115
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:03,386
for a long time.

116
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,256
Don't I deserve to say that?

117
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:08,858
You're so...

118
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,764
It must be nice to be so unwavering.

119
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,166
Before you showed up,

120
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,635
I didn't know Si Hyun didn't return my feelings.

121
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:22,872
I realized my feelings too late,

122
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:25,274
but I don't think that's solely my fault.

123
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:27,744
Not everyone...

124
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,180
is as sure about their feelings as you are...

125
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,982
and can do what they want.

126
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,686
I'd like you to know that at least.

127
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:39,789
I'm leaving.

128
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:42,658
That's the one thing you wanted me to do.

129
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,328
Disappear from Si Hyun's life.

130
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,598
I'll live as if nothing happened.

131
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:50,133
I'll forget everything.

132
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,771
I wonder if you all can.

133
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,387
Not everyone...

134
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:14,357
is as sure about their feelings as you are...

135
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:16,359
and can do what they want.

136
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,762
I'd like you to know that at least.

137
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,164
Tae Hee.

138
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,235
Are you okay?

139
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,304
Of course.

140
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,473
Did you see someone?

141
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,009
Yes. Soo Ji.

142
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,577
Did you beat her up?

143
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,215
Yes. I beat her,

144
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,318
but why don't I feel better?

145
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:48,391
Good job. I don't care what you did. Good job.

146
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,665
Hello, Ms. Jo.

147
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:59,135
I was going to call you regarding Hye Jeong's tutoring.

148
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:03,306
Tae Hee, have you talked to Hye Jeong recently?

149
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:07,443
Pardon? No. Why?

150
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,278
Hye Jeong...

151
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,116
hasn't been coming home.

152
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,986
I'm telling you because I trust you as Kyung Joo's friend.

153
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:19,055
So please don't tell anyone else,

154
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:23,292
and do call me if you hear from her.

155
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,427
Please, okay?

156
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,763
Okay, I'll do that. Goodbye.

157
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,968
(Hye Jeong)

158
00:10:34,804 --> 00:10:37,106
The phone you have reached is turned off.

159
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:40,443
Where did she go?

160
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:45,715
Excuse me.

161
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,050
Where are you taking these?

162
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:52,121
I'm not sure. Somewhere in Icheon. Do you know this person?

163
00:10:57,226 --> 00:11:00,129
- Hello? - Your dad is recovering well.

164
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,597
Don't worry about him.

165
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,166
I'll get changed and come right over.

166
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,569
Get some more rest, and come tomorrow.

167
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:12,875
Ki Young.

168
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:17,246
Just as I've led Seowon this far,

169
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:20,216
I always tried very hard so you could go up higher.

170
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,219
I thought Samyeong Foods was a better choice...

171
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,087
than Myoungjeong.

172
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:26,856
But...

173
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,358
what's happened now?

174
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:31,894
Dad.

175
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:34,864
Samyeong Foods is completely insane.

176
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,633
Do you know how humiliated I was?

177
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:41,771
I told you not to act rashly without an alternative!

178
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:44,006
If you have no power,

179
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,008
anything becomes your fault even if it wasn't.

180
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,411
Didn't you get that...

181
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:50,546
when you dropped charges even after JK's son beat you?

182
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,416
Go apologize to Samyeong Foods,

183
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,551
and get them to keep the engagement.

184
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,789
Is there a place you can rise up to...

185
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,892
with your talent without Samyeong backing you up?

186
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,261
No way.

187
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,097
Stop disappointing me any further.

188
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,103
You aren't feverish.

189
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:16,706
Do you want some nutritional supplements?

190
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:19,642
It's okay. I'll be better when I get some rest.

191
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:23,145
Se Joo's on his way. I'll go home with him.

192
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,756
President Myung, I have urgent news.

193
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:37,727
You should go home.

194
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,663
Why? What is it?

195
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:42,598
You don't have to know.

196
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,467
Go on, now.

197
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:55,277
Assemblyman Kim has been summoned by the prosecution for bribery.

198
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:58,914
They searched through his place, so they might break in here soon.

199
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:01,784
If you have anything to get rid of, you must do so immediately.

200
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:05,955
There were suspicions of special treatment...

201
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:08,057
behind the launching of the new drug, Tiuzen,

202
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:11,327
and evidence of Assemblyman Kim's intervention has been found.

203
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:14,363
Assemblyman Kim is currently under investigation...

204
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:16,132
by the prosecution as a key suspect.

205
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:17,166
This way.

206
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,502
The prosecution found evidence of Assemblyman Kim...

207
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,237
receiving a bribe from the pharmaceutical company,

208
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:24,006
then pressuring the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug.

209
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:30,946
Mom, did you do something wrong?

210
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,049
What are they saying on the news? What's all this?

211
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,818
I'm getting investigated as a testifier, that's all.

212
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:37,887
Don't worry about it, and go home.

213
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,189
It's JK, isn't it? This isn't you.

214
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,390
Soo Ji.

215
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:50,866
Soo Ji.

216
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,902
I didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,371
This has to do with JK from the start.

218
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,441
Where are they? Why are you dealing with this all by yourself?

219
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:04,814
I'll take care of this. Please go home.

220
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:35,111
Both Mom and Si Hyun.

221
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:38,881
People that I like...

222
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,183
keep disappearing.

223
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:43,452
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,358
Why are you sorry?

225
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,396
Why are you always sorry?

226
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,603
You're the one who's done the most for the three of us.

227
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:08,210
Tae Hee hopes that I suffer for a very long time,

228
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,715
- and it's really... - Stop having such thoughts.

229
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,053
Let's go home and get some rest. I'll go over to see you tomorrow.

230
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:19,622
Se Joo.

231
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:27,163
Don't feel sorry for me no matter what happens.

232
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:30,733
It makes me really sad...

233
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,403
to hear you say you're sorry.

234
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:02,965
What? Why?

235
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,267
There's no reason for you to call me anymore.

236
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,303
Don't say that.

237
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,505
I found Hye Jeong.

238
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:12,074
What? Where is she?

239
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,578
Be quiet, and just come to the address that I'll send you.

240
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,046
See you soon.

241
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,591
Hey, don't be nervous.

242
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,459
You'll get Hye Jeong, then go home.

243
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,630
Okay, Ki Young. But don't be too scary, okay?

244
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,198
I won't be.

245
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,668
Look.

246
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:46,875
Se Joo.

247
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:50,279
What have you done to Mom's art gallery?

248
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:53,849
Come here right now...

249
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,018
before I burn this place down.

250
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,956
I can eat everything I want without worrying about getting fat,

251
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,458
and I don't have any private lessons either.

252
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,527
These are the happiest days of my life.

253
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,662
Hye Jeong.

254
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,598
But you have to promise to go home tomorrow, okay?

255
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:10,666
Promise me.

256
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:14,903
You promised.

257
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:20,109
Are they here for the empty dishes? I'll get the door.

258
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:23,312
One second.

259
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:34,723
Hey, Hye Jeong!

260
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,094
You.

261
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:48,103
The person you have reached is not available. Please try again...

262
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:01,016
- Nice shot. - That was nothing.

263
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,588
You crazy idiots! How can you drink now?

264
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,557
We can go now, Ki Young.

265
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:10,926
And I think he's badly hurt.

266
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:13,662
You idiot. We have to see Se Joo before we go.

267
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:16,465
And you said Se Joo hooked them up.

268
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,567
Ki Young.

269
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:21,770
He's bleeding a lot.

270
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,110
What are you doing? Stop making a scene.

271
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,445
Are you an idiot?

272
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,918
What is this?

273
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:45,227
(Lee Ki Young's first love)

274
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,762
"Lee Ki Young's first love"?

275
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,366
Look at this.

276
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,402
What is this place?

277
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:57,573
Soo Ji, Si Hyun, and Se Joo. Those brats.

278
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:06,548
You even used a camera?

279
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:17,526
Don't come near!

280
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,996
Goodness, he's badly hurt.

281
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:24,833
Hey, were you acquainted with Hye Jeong first...

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,302
or with Se Joo and Si Hyun first?

283
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:29,304
Hey.

284
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,376
Answer me. I'm asking you a question.

285
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,012
I met Se Joo...

286
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,647
and Si Hyun first.

287
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,549
I knew it.

288
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,621
They dragged your sister in on purpose.

289
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:48,023
- To ruin her. - No.

290
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,626
Fate brought us together.

291
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:52,060
Shut up!

292
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,096
All this happened because of you!

293
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:56,865
Why are you yelling at your sister?

294
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:59,401
Hye Jeong and I are both victims!

295
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:02,938
When will Se Joo get here?

296
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,974
I should call Si Hyun too.

297
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,911
I have a debt to repay him anyway.

298
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,281
There he is.

299
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:18,420
Se Joo.

300
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,890
Send them away. I'll explain.

301
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,827
Shut your mouth. Get on your knees.

302
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:28,797
You locked yourself up in here and plotted to ruin others' lives?

303
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,433
Shall I call Soo Ji too?

304
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:33,402
Yes?

305
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:36,138
You only listen when she's around.

306
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,140
You psycho.

307
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:39,908
Don't.

308
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,184
That scared me.

309
00:20:58,861 --> 00:20:59,995
(Se Joo)

310
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,702
Hey.

311
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:08,770
It's Ki Young.

312
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,921
Si Hyun.

313
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,991
Will you stop these thugs?

314
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:31,493
Hye Jeong.

315
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:35,564
I'll explain nicely just this once.

316
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,101
You, me,

317
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,504
and Tae Hee are victims.

318
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,273
Let me out of here.

319
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:46,875
- Hurry up right now. - Hey.

320
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,645
Take them, and get lost. Go on.

321
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,347
You two, stay for a chat.

322
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:54,316
Lee Ki Young.

323
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:57,886
You're talking so casually already?

324
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:01,023
I have all the evidence.

325
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:04,927
Don't you even think of calling the police.

326
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,229
Your brother will go to prison.

327
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:09,464
All this.

328
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,266
We did it together.

329
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:24,613
Hye Jeong, sit him down over here.

330
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,081
Sit over here.

331
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,115
Be careful.

332
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,518
- Hye Jeong, I'll call a taxi. - Okay.

333
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:32,788
Oh no...

334
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:35,390
Hye Jeong.

335
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:38,660
Will they be okay?

336
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:40,596
Oh dear.

337
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:44,433
I'll see what I can do. What should I do?

338
00:22:57,813 --> 00:22:59,014
Hye Jeong.

339
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,283
- Where are you? - Tae Hee.

340
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:04,853
I'm outside Se Joo's hideout.

341
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:07,055
- They're in big trouble. - What?

342
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:09,558
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

343
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:13,862
Lee Ki Young beat up Joo An really badly.

344
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:17,265
We barely got out,

345
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:20,569
but Si Hyun and Se Joo's still inside.

346
00:23:21,603 --> 00:23:23,105
Ki Young said...

347
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:26,241
he, me, and you are some sort of victims.

348
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,845
Hello?

349
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:31,513
Hello?

350
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:37,486
What are you up to?

351
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,792
That's what I want to ask you.

352
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,799
- What did you do? - Let Se Joo go.

353
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,835
- You can talk to me. - Si Hyun, you leave.

354
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,437
They won't stop halfway.

355
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:57,105
Will you shut up?

356
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:06,214
I started all this. Take it out on me.

357
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,354
I owe you something.

358
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:14,022
If you evade it...

359
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,757
or get smart,

360
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,060
he dies.

361
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:23,398
Do as you wish.

362
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:43,618
What's he doing?

363
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:45,887
Fine.

364
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,656
I'll do as you wish.

365
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:53,495
Hey.

366
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:22,891
(Lee Ki Young)

367
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,511
Don't you think we did enough?

368
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:44,446
Must I do more?

369
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:47,582
He said we could do we pleased.

370
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:57,025
If you're scared, take your brother and go home.

371
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:00,529
What is it that you want?

372
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,402
For you to know how ugly you are.

373
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:09,037
Now, you ask?

374
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,072
Right.

375
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:12,841
Tae Hee.

376
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:14,943
Does she know all this?

377
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,246
Don't you dare mention her.

378
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:21,183
It has nothing to do with her.

379
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:26,655
How is that when you started this because of me?

380
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,797
Speak of the devil.

381
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:37,899
Shall I answer?

382
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,835
And tell her to come over?

383
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:48,376
Kwon Si Hyun!

384
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:18,974
(Tempted)

385
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,110
Do you know that Kwon Si Hyun toyed with you?

386
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,880
Hang up! Don't believe him!

387
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,248
You should reconsider.

388
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,683
Why should you leave? Why should you avoid them?

389
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:30,852
I'm not leaving or avoiding them.

390
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:36,091
I want to rest and study. It's my decision. I made it for me.
