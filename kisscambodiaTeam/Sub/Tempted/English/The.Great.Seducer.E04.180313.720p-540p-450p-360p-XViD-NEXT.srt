1
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:09,155
Are you testing me?

2
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:11,125
Like before?

3
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,465
(Episode 4)

4
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:27,005
Do you think I can't do it?

5
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,750
Her dad who attempted suicide is still in prison,

6
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:50,550
- and their business failed. - She and her mom are strong.

7
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:54,390
Her mom's on TV often as if she's a successful hospital director.

8
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,220
Tennis and cello, she's trying hard to act like a rich kid.

9
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:59,075
She'll die if she tries harder.

10
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:25,635
Don't cry, Soo Ji.

11
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,435
Get lost.

12
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,635
I wouldn't have cried if you weren't here.

13
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,375
They're jealous of you.

14
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:37,545
What more do they need to not be jealous of me?

15
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:42,015
A handsome boyfriend like me?

16
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,415
I said get lost.

17
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:50,125
Shall we...

18
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,725
date?

19
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,595
Let's go out.

20
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:05,020
Do you pity me because the kids here look down on me?

21
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,905
- Hey. - But then,

22
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,275
no one would touch me if I were to date you.

23
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:10,745
That's not it.

24
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,685
Are you grateful that my mom is your mom's doctor?

25
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,825
When will you stop...

26
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,885
doubting people?

27
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,395
No.

28
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:30,835
Why?

29
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:33,335
Such relationships don't last.

30
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,335
But...

31
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:45,375
you can kiss me just once.

32
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,175
Marriage?

33
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:24,815
You?

34
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:31,855
First floor.

35
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:38,835
Going down.

36
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:43,465
I'm sorry, but I have to cancel.

37
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:55,245
Forget it.

38
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,585
Show me how you feel in a different way.

39
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,170
The game you suggested before. The scholarship girl.

40
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:04,325
- No? - Deal.

41
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,065
Because what I'll gain...

42
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,305
is much more amazing.

43
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,130
You could lose.

44
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,570
How can you guarantee you'll win?

45
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:32,800
Hey, how could I lose? How could she not like me?

46
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,655
Gosh, such confidence.

47
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:37,810
You sounded too much like Se Joo. Don't do that.

48
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:40,665
My plans just got canceled.

49
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:43,195
What were you doing? Are you done talking?

50
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,085
Welcome.

51
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,385
Is Soo Ji better?

52
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,110
You knew what had happened?

53
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:15,165
Mr. Yoon tipped me off.

54
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:16,825
I'm so embarrassed.

55
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:20,605
It's my fault. She shouldn't have found out that way.

56
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,250
She'll come around. Eat.

57
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,560
When she talks back, she sounds like my daughter again.

58
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:28,045
I don't know.

59
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,275
She won't talk to me much since that day.

60
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,215
Thanks for asking.

61
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:39,215
You have a soft side.

62
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:46,325
Does Si Hyun feel awkward too? What did he say?

63
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:51,050
Let's discuss our kids' problems together.

64
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:53,520
You can let me look after Si Hyun.

65
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:56,965
He liked me quite a lot when he was younger.

66
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:01,345
I saw him often since your wife got sick.

67
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,145
- Eat. I'm done. - Already?

68
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,085
This is why I asked to meet you at a restaurant.

69
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,085
I met the chairwoman.

70
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:14,585
If Tiuzen doesn't go to market,

71
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:18,525
she's afraid it will become harder to get Myoungjeong back-door listed.

72
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:22,680
Despite being in the red,

73
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:24,535
JK Bio was only listed...

74
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:26,180
because of Tiuzen.

75
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,465
Don't worry.

76
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,635
Trust and follow me.

77
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,145
Was the Supporters' Night a success?

78
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:35,775
The marriage announcement.

79
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,345
It was an unexpected event.

80
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,770
I didn't think you'd announce it there.

81
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,430
I had to because you didn't propose properly.

82
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,085
Wasn't it because you wanted to get listed sooner?

83
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,855
Is that what you thought?

84
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:53,395
I felt bad that the news came out the way it did,

85
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,295
but you looked okay.

86
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:58,235
I didn't know that's what you thought.

87
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:01,635
- I should go. - Wait.

88
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:11,430
I didn't propose properly.

89
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:12,775
Like you said.

90
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:29,525
The doors are closing.

91
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:46,415
Your mom's car is here. It's all ready to go.

92
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,885
I'm not asking you to fall in love.

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,225
I know.

94
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,595
I can't like anyone else but you.

95
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,365
Make sure...

96
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,805
she gets completely smitten by you.

97
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,575
Why does it sound like...

98
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,185
you're talking about yourself?

99
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
Fine.

100
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,425
And then I'll dump her, right?

101
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,095
How can anyone hate me?

102
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,845
Yes.

103
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:23,605
How can anyone hate you?

"Eun Tae Hee".

108
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,115
Let's do this.

109
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:42,425
My gosh.

110
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:45,910
Why are you following me? Get diagnosed, and leave.

111
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:48,650
I only got out of that room to come to this hospital.

112
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,495
I'm a patient.

113
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,890
After you see your mom, come back and buy me a meal.

114
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm hungry.

115
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,335
Hey.

116
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:59,205
Keep these on. Some might think I beat you up.

117
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,460
Is this the girl who got the scholarship?

118
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,485
Yes, very cute.

119

Take a look at this.

124
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,460
We're almost finished.

125
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,790
I'd love to move in right away if possible.

126
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,745
We wanted to finish it before school, but it got a bit delayed.

127
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,115
It's okay.

128
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,345
When would you like to move in?

129
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:45,985
The move-in? One second.

130
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:52,510

00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,400
Hello, President Myung.

133
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:20,955
I'm Eun Tae Hee, this year's scholarship student.

134
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,470
Are you here to turn in your documents?

135
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,455
Yes. I have always...

136
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,710
looked up to you.

137
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,910
Thank you. I will study hard.

138
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,995
- See you later. - Thank you.

139
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,305
Goodbye.

140
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,575
Why does she seem so familiar?

141
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:45,960
Here's your prescription.

142
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:47,030
Thank you.

143
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:50,415
Miss, you're very cute. When do you get off?

144
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,225
She's pretty.

145
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:03,725
Darn it, Ki Young, that idiot. You have a good taste for nothing.

146
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,435
When do you get off again?

147
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:10,735
This is Eun Tae Hee who just signed off the scholarship.

148
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,860
Which day did I say I'll move into the dorm again?

149
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:15,160
I suddenly got confused.

150
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:18,715
You're written down for the Saturday of the first week.

151
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,100
I guess I'm a bit out of it because I'm too happy.

152
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,115
Thank you. Goodbye.

153
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,685
What are you doing here?

154
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,055
I'll give you one last chance.

155
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:34,480
Are you really going to marry Si Hyun's dad?

156
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:35,610
Yes.

157
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:37,325
I'm against this marriage.

158
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:42,305
Si Hyun and I are very close. We're best friends.

159
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,375
I'm glad.

160
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:46,390
I was afraid that you were bullying him.

161

Mom.

162
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,185
What's the problem?

163
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:59,470
You can just sit around and become JK Group's daughter.

164
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:01,355
I'm giving that to you.

165
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,225
What's your problem?

166
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,225
Don't pretend like you're doing this for me.

167
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:08,710
I never wanted this.

168
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,110
Then think about what you want.

169
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:13,695
Just think of 1 thing or 100 things you want every single day.

170
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:22,675
You don't have to try hard.

171
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,375
I will bring everything for you.

172
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,585
Is it Si Hyun?

173
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,040
Do you like him?

174
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,455
No.

175
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,295
No matter who you like at this age,

176
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,595
this is just a friendship.

177
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,965
Then why did you try to set me up with Lee Ki Young?

178
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,705
Soo Ji, stop throwing a fit.

179
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,505
Is this a ring?

180
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,815
I can't believe this.

181
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,085
Do you really like him?

182
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:04,415
Or do you want JK Group?

183
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,485
Both.

184
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:11,455
Happy?

185
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,595
What about Dad?

Does he know that you're getting married?

187
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,495
He'll see the article.

188
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:22,465
- You're something. - I'm sorry I couldn't ask you.

189
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:24,475
But this is my problem,

190
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:26,360
and you're an adult.

191
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:30,675
How can you use your dad as the only excuse for stopping this marriage?

192
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:39,255
I don't want you to get something that you want.

193
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,485
You always had to sacrifice someone.

194
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,255
Soo Ji.

195
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,995
I'm not giving up.

196
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:50,295
I know.

197
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,465
But things won't go your way either.

198
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,445
If you can stop me, go ahead.

199
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:04,105
Try to take my position as JK Group's lady.

200
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,845
You can have practically anything you want.

201
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,615
That's how I brought you up.

202
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,085
It's crystal clear that I am your daughter.

203
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,225
I get that very well.

204
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,225
But I'm different from you.

205
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,825
I don't play those games just because I want those things.

206
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,935
I don't think I can wait for long.

207
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:33,575
You should step up your game, Si Hyun.

208
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,155
I'm very sorry about back then.

209
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,395
I'm really sorry.

210
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,865
It was a traffic accident.

211
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,365
Are you okay?

212
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,175
What?

213
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,475
Si Hyun.

214
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,885
How did you know where I live?

215
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:52,715
Are these for me?

216
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:57,055
Yes, well, I was passing by and thought of you.

217
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,055
You thought of me?

218
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:02,995
I thought a lot about you.

219
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,765
Don't feel any pressure.

220
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,965
I'm just your friend's mom.

221
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,760
- Si Hyun. - Yes?

222
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,545
You can't be in the neighborhood for too long.

223
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:17,030
There are too many nosy people.

224
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,260
Okay.

225
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:22,470
I can't believe what she's up to.

226
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,270
Is she crazy? What is my mom doing?

227
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:26,970
Just accept the friend request.

228
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,225
No.

229
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:32,155
It should be illegal to follow family members online.

230
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,480
(Friend request from Soo Ji)

231
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:36,425
Choi Soo Ji added me as a friend. Why?

232
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:41,165
Go back inside. You must feel cold.

233
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:44,905
Kyung Joo. I suddenly want tteokbokki.

234
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,535
- Let's go. - Tteokbokki?

235
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,105
Eun Tae Hee.

236
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,985
Kwon Si Hyun?

237
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:05,195
Ko Kyung Joo. It's been a while.

238
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:07,225
Why are you in the area?

239
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,495
Well, I was...

240
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,635
here to see her.

241
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:18,860
But that's actually a lie.

242
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,090
You know each other?

243
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,445
- Yes. - No.

244
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:23,205
No.

245
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,045
Tae Hee.

246
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:30,245
- What? - I have something to say to him.

247
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,615
Will you wait at the tteokbokki place?

248
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:36,725
No. I have something else to do and have to go.

249
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:39,825
You two can talk all you want. See you.

250
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,205
What should I do?

251
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:56,145
Kyung Joo doesn't know, does she?

252
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,245
How can he be in a love triangle with her mom?

253
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:06,485
I was so ashamed that I wanted to take the secret to my grave.

254
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,255
You met my mom, didn't you?

255
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:16,480
Nothing weird happened. Our group...

256
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:17,750
Whatever.

257
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:19,635
Did you tell anyone about it?

258
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,420
Did you tell my friend?

259
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:23,835
- No. - What about Soo Ji or Se Joo?

260
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:27,320
I don't think they know.

261
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,430
It's so embarrassing.

262
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,560
I think I'll die of embarrassment.

263
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,000
No, they really don't know,

264
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:37,545
- and nothing weird happened. - You two met at a club!

265
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,255
Nothing's working out today.

266
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:48,965
He's such a jerk.

267
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:56,235
Hey. Hey, hey.

268
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,805
She's crying, and he won't even comfort her?

269
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:06,475
Poor Kyung Joo.

270
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:08,615
She got dumped again.

271
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,955
- Hello. - Hi, it's me.

272
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:18,555
When can the tutor start teaching Hye Jeong?

273
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:21,725
I told you that it won't happen.

274
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:24,735
That tutor only teaches the smartest students.

275
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:26,980
At least as smart as my Kyung Joo.

276
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,805
Hye Jeong's useless at math.

277
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:30,935
Look.

278
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:33,760
She needs a tutor because she's useless.

279
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:35,060
To learn.

280
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:36,990
Stop being so stubborn.

281
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,600
I told you about a tutor who's great with elementary kids.

282
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:42,270
I'll put you two in touch.

283
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,645
Forget it.

284
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:46,700
I saw you a little earlier.

285
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,070
You got a lovely bunch of flowers.

286
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:51,510
- What? - Bye, Na Yoon.

287
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:52,825
Hello?

288
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,865
What got into that hag?

289
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,465
Did she see us?

290
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:07,160
- You're home. - Hey.

291
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:09,245
Who brought those flowers?

292
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:10,945
They weren't couriered, were they?

293
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:15,885
No. A handsome, young man gave them to her.

294
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:18,840
Kyung Joo, what are you talking about?

295
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,455
I can't understand.

296
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:31,750
Hi, Kyung Joo.

297
00:22:31,753 --> 00:22:35,190
I think Kwon Si Hyun was here to see you.

298
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,250
Me? Why?

299
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:40,220
Why didn't you tell me he almost hit you with his car?

300
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:43,590
It wasn't that big a deal.

301
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,715
I didn't know you knew him.

302
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,045
Tae Hee.

303
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,300
I don't want you to get involved with him.

304
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,400
Of course. Why would I get involved with him?

305
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:54,740
How amazing.

306
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:57,070
He didn't hit you. He just almost hit you,

307
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,955
and he came over here?

308
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:03,025
Did he say anything else that day?

309
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:05,035
Like what?

310
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:06,695
Never mind.

311
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:09,950
Tell me if you feel any aftereffects.

312
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,790
I'll be your messenger.

313
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:13,205
Okay, I...

314
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:14,735
No.

315
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:16,790
There are no aftereffects.

316
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:18,675
I won't be calling him.

317
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,445
Okay, then. Sleep well.

318
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:29,885
She must've really liked him a lot.

319
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:34,695
What now?

320
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:38,125
It's obvious.

321
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,265
I'll stay well away from him.

322
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:42,965
Darn it.

323
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:48,760
Ko Kyung Joo.

324
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:52,230
She and Park Hye Jeong follow each other, so I sent a friend request.

325
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:53,630
She's Eun Tae Hee's best friend.

326
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:55,245
Ko Kyung Joo...

327
00:23:57,973 --> 00:23:59,885
What did you say to her?

328
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:02,340
"Sorry, I kissed your mom"?

329
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:04,570
Say that once more, I dare you.

330
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:07,010
I can't believe that lady is Ko Kyung Joo's mom.

331
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:09,810
Exactly. That lady looked totally...

332
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:13,265
You two keep calling her "lady".

333
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,465
- She looks like one. - She looks like one.

334
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:22,775
Shall I find something out for you?

335
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,375
I'll deal with it.

336
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:30,115
Why is he so confident?

337
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:10,625
Two people.

338
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:13,725
Weirdo.

339
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,465
Are you following me?

340
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,635
No. I'm trying to straighten out a misunderstanding.

341
00:25:57,993 --> 00:25:59,705
Will you let go?

342
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:02,175
Oh, sorry.

343
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,115
Weirdo.

344
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:49,240
Hey.

345
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:50,540
What?

346
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,310
Oh, I'm so sorry.

347
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:53,625
Oh dear.

348
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:56,495
Darn it. Jerk.

349
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:58,795
Stand properly, or I'll kill you.

350
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:04,635
You're a scumbag.

351
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:06,735
(Safety first)

352
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,990
Get your life straightened out!

353
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,275
Get lost!

354
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,145
I want a boyfriend like that.

355
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:22,040
He's so awesome.

356
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:23,555
You're right.

357
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:27,225
It didn't go as planned, but you do have to pay the remainder.

358
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,535
You don't have to thank me.

359
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,435
Was this a setup with that pervert?

360
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:41,690
- What? - Why did you let him go?

361
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,175
I couldn't take him to the police because of you.

362
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,830
Well, I...

363
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:48,015
Oh, and you've checked my background too.

364
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,900
If not, how did you show up at Kyung Joo's place yesterday,

365
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,785
and how did you end up on this bus?

366
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,625
You must not remember at all.

367
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,020
This is the third time we meet.

368
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:09,535
And the second time we meet on a bus.

369
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:21,815
You're...

370
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:24,045
You finally recognize me.

371
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:27,785
Nice to meet you,

372
00:28:28,243 --> 00:28:29,485
Eun Tae Hee.

373
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:58,540
(Tempted)

374
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,070
You have a friend named Tae Hee, right?

375
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,270
It looks like Si Hyun has met her by chance.

376
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:04,210
What? Why did he call me?

377
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:06,210
I'll probably be on your mind.

378
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:08,965
Why does he do this? What do you want?

379
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:10,580
Man, this is annoying.

380
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:11,550
Darn it.

381
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,350
Do you remember who Si Hyun is?

382
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:15,090
He's not as bad as you think.

383
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,420
How long will you follow me?

384
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:17,550
Why did you call two days ago?

385
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,290
If you wanted to know, you could've called me.

386
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,920
What do you want? You followed me all the way here.

387
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:21,960
I missed you.

388
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:23,705
Why do you miss me?

389
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,215
I'm interested in you.
