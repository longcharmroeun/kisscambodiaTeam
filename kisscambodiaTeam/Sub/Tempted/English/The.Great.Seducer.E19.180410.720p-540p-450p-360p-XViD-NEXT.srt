1
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:08,979
Do you...

2
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:12,782
not like me anymore?

3
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:13,883
No.

4
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:16,419
You don't like me?

5
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:21,925
No.

6
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:52,622
(Episode 19)

7
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,341
Did you two know about this when you came here today?

8
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:16,513
I can't stand this.

9
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,682
Let me go drop off Si Hyun.

10
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:22,085
Let me come with you. Let's take him to Tae Hee.

11
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,219
Let her go.

12
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:26,022
I'll call a chauffeur to Si Hyun's house.

13
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,059
Do you know where Si Hyun lives?

14
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:30,293
What?

15
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:32,629
No.

16
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,466
Drive Kyung Joo home.

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,736
I'll go home after I drop off Si Hyun.

18
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:43,740
But still...

19
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,875
Let her go.

20
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:50,780
Hey, Si Hyun. Get yourself together.

21
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:54,617
Let's go.

22
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:06,663
I can't help it.

23
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:09,799
- I'll go check on Tae Hee. - Until when will you keep that up?

24
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,368
What?

25
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,503
Until when...

26
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:16,606
will you and I clean up after our friends?

27
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,096
We're here. Let's go.

28
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,337
I don't want to go in.

29
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,523
Okay.

30
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,659
Don't go in then.

31
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:11,394
Please continue driving.

32
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:21,638
Si Hyun. Si Hyun...

33
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:34,511
What's wrong with you?

34
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,257
Should I...

35
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,226
stay here tonight?

36
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,370
Why?

37
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,372
Are you that sad?

38
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:08,511
Look at me.

39
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,180
You.

40
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,182
Me.

41
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,951
And Se Joo.

42
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:20,290
We only had each other when times were tough.

43
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:23,426
We truly believed...

44
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:28,164
that if it wasn't for the three of us,

45
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,800
no one would understand us.

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,935
- Soo Ji! - Let go of me.

47
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:33,803
- We believed so. - Wake up!

48
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,077
We did.

49
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:45,148
That's why...

50
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,351
I'm here with you today.

51
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:55,224
That was so natural for me until this day.

52
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:00,063
Go to sleep.

53
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,065
And when you wake up,

54
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,667
let's go home together.

55
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:13,643
But I do not...

56
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,847
feel like that anymore.

57
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,090
10th floor. The doors are opening.

58
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:05,561
Going down.

59
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:00,817
My gosh.

60
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:04,754
It was too dark in here.

61
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:07,757
Can you take this and hand me a cutting nipper?

62
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,926
What? Okay.

63
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,844
What are you trying to do to me?

64
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,658
(Myoungjeong Hospital)

65
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,960
- Yes, President Myung. - Can you bring me...

66
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,563
Vice Chairman Kwon's medical checkup result from last year?

67
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:32,008
(Physical Examination for Draft, Park Kyu Jeong)

68
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:34,143
It won't be easy for you...

69
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,445
to get used to JK Group, President Myung.

70
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,048
You can't deal with your business or children..

71
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,818
by only sticking to rules and principles.

72
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,658
I apologize, but we cannot make a false diagnosis.

73
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:51,027
That's considered a forging of an official document.

74
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,797
Please bring your son to be diagnosed by a doctor,

75
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,532
and let him receive treatment.

76
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,935
We can give you the diagnosis after you do that.

77
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,205
Do you think I don't know the rules?

78
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,007
Kyu Jeong is our heir.

79
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:07,343
I thought you'd understand now that you became...

80
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:08,611
a part of the royal family.

81
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,248
Vice Chairman Kwon must go to another hospital...

82
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:15,051
because it feels like he's talking to a wall.

83
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:19,822
What do you mean?

84
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:22,058
Hye Jeong told me that...

85
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,994
she saw Soo Ji's stepdad at her optometrist's office.

86
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,908
Vice Chairman Kwon did not receive a physical checkup last year.

87
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,509
He changed the appointment many times,

88
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,245
but he ended up never coming in.

89
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,981
All right.

90
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,840
What brings you here? You didn't even call.

91
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:15,578
I wanted some beer, but I had nowhere else to go.

92
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,387
Oh, these.

93
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,056
Soo Ji always tells me not to do this,

94
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:28,190
but this is so comfortable.

95
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,426
Then you can stay like that.

96
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:32,361
- I do that too. - Have a seat.

97
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:41,270
Wow, looks good.

98
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,606
I love beer with chicken.

99
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:45,741
It's been forever.

100
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,643
I've never seen you happier.

101
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:49,912
Soo Ji won't eat this with me.

102
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,481
Do you do this often with Si Hyun?

103
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:53,482
No.

104
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:56,852
I'm sorry for not calling...

105
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:59,455
after Tiuzen passed the screening.

106
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,663
That's so refreshing.

107
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,566
This must be why I wanted to stay late.

108
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,439
May I ask you for a favor?

109
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,240
Of course.

110
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:21,444
Soo Ji's department has an idea for a business and academic cooperation.

111
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:24,947
It's a program for businesses to sponsor new musicians.

112
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,149
Can you consider their proposal?

113
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,318
You can make a decision and go ahead with it.

114
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:35,458
Do you have a physical condition by any chance?

115
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,130
Someone has seen you at another hospital.

116
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,803
I guess someone saw me at my optometrist's office.

117
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,306
I'm fine. Nothing is wrong.

118
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,410
You should get checked up.

119
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:56,912
You need to make some time.

120
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:02,051
Are you sure you're okay?

121
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:05,054
Yes, I'm fine.

122
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,224
Our eye doctors are great too.

123
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,327
Okay.

124
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,730
If you don't feel well,

125
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,433
you have to tell me first.

126
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:21,404
I'm not trying to give you pressure.

127
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,140
I mean, we have to keep our business running.

128
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:33,616
I will.

129
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:36,752
I'll tell you first.

130
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,424
Do you think...

131
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,893
Si Hyun really liked Tae Hee?

132
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,028
Tae Hee would know.

133
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:48,397
There really is no way of telling how someone feels.

134
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:50,933
How could he do that if he really liked her?

135
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,968
Did she like Si Hyun a lot?

136
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,237
Very much.

137
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,606
That's why she's holding back.

138
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,775
Kyung Joo.

139
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,145
Do you really know how you feel?

140
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,981
Does anyone know accurately how they feel?

141
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:07,283
How can they know?

142
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,919
You can tell for sure...

143
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,455
after you kiss someone.

144
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:17,426
You might not like me that much either.

145
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,984
Hey, I don't think I liked you that much.

146
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:44,553
I guess I just liked you as a friend.

147
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,623
Oh, my gosh. This is embarrassing.

148
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,924
Goodbye.

149
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,261
Bye.

150
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:09,512
Kyung Joo.

151
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,216
What's wrong, Kyung Joo?

152
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,654
What's wrong, darling?

153
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:42,571
Let's meet up. I have something to say.

154
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:53,115
Ko Kyung Joo, are you missing lectures again today?

155
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:59,321
Poor Kyung Joo hasn't been eating...

156
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:00,623
or sleeping.

157
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,628
Look right here. I've aged too.

158
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,599
I brought tteokbokki and tempura.

159
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,134
Get up.

160
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:15,904
Here.

161
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:21,710
You kissed him...

162
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:25,848
and realized that you really liked Se Joo?

163
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:30,819
And you could clearly tell that he didn't like you?

164
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,789
Yes.

165
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:35,758
Eat up.

166
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,527
You know how you both feel, and that's that.

167
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:39,962
Why cry about it?

168
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,398
Are you okay?

169
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,468
I'm fine.

170
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,237
Not dating won't kill me.

171
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:50,806
It's for the best.

172
00:17:51,507 --> 00:17:54,510
I unwittingly relied on him and let him get on my nerves.

173
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:57,680
I don't like that now.

174
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,284
- That's a lie. - It's true.

175
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,586
Don't mention him anymore.

176
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:09,091
Congratulations on ending your unrequited love.

177
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:15,397
Still, it's the first time I dumped a guy, isn't it?

178
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,466
Yes.

179
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:21,837
You two can still be friends.

180
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,339
It worked out.

181
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:25,574
Will you really end it like this?

182
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,650
I thought of clinging onto him...

183
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,319
or demanding an explanation.

184
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,424
I won't.

185
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,259
It's a waste of time.

186
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:50,666
Where did it go?

187
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,143
- Did you get home safely? - Right.

188
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:36,445
I had a really hard time hailing a taxi.

189
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:39,415
You shouldn't drink. You keep blacking out.

190
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,183
You'll get alcohol-related dementia.

191
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,487
Sorry.

192
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:46,755
You're sorry?

193
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,024
For what?

194
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:54,396
You don't remember.

195
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,033
I'm not sure.

196
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,902
Did you do something wrong?

197
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:01,737
Okay, then.

198
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,245
What is it? Did you two get into a fight already?

199
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,149
Did you get home safely?

200
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:16,351
Well, I slept here.

201
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,454
Soo Ji dropped me off and went home.

202
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,622
Why sleep here and not at home?

203
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:24,326
Why did you summon us, Soo Ji?

204
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:43,545
Seol Young Won.

205
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,149
A potter. The same age as Seok Woo and from the same university.

206
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,885
Can you guess what's next?

207
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,119
(Potter Seol Young Won)

208
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:55,524
Do you know her?

209
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:57,726
No.

210
00:20:58,393 --> 00:20:59,661
Did you check?

211
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,865
I saw them together with my own eyes.

212
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,701
She held an exhibition at Joosung Hotel.

213
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,838
Does your mother know?

214
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:11,039
Yes.

215
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:13,008
I'm embarrassed to say that...

216
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:15,210
she bought the woman's work.

217
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:17,646
You should have a few at home.

218
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:24,419
She used to be quite prolific back in the day.

219
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:28,390
In an interview, she said that her works sold out,

220
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,092
and she has no idea where they went.

221
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:33,462
For an artist to become famous, the buyer should...

222
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:36,331
exhibit them, give them as gifts, and brag about them.

223
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,768
Artists become famous when people talk about them.

224
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:42,804
Someone's ruining her chances to do so?

225
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:47,142
Did my mom ruin this woman's future?

226
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:50,879
- It can't be that. - It could be the opposite.

227
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:54,683
Your dad could be trying to help her.

228
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:56,351
Isn't that touching?

229
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,423
That has her email address.

230
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:02,524
(Studio Address)

231
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:04,927
She has studios in Icheon and Jeongeup.

232
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:08,897
What'll you do?

233
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:11,934
Revenge...

234
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,736
is to take what's most valuable.

235
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:17,606
What's that to her?

236
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:19,508
Si Hyun's dad?

237
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:22,477
Her work?

238
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:26,114
- Or her child? - Soo Ji.

239
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,051
What's wrong with you?

240
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,455
Is she married? Any kids?

241
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:34,923
No.

242
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:37,993
- I don't know. - Will you stop...

243
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:40,996
Isn't it enough to know who she is?

244
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:43,765
The marriage will be all over the news.

245
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:45,734
There's no way she won't find out.

246
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:48,403
If your dad keeps seeing her, deal with it then.

247
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:50,105
You could do that.

248
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:52,074
It's up to you.

249
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,280
I'll deal with it. See you.

250
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:01,717
Take care.

251
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:25,040
Hi, I'm Eun Tae Hee.

252
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,742
She's Kyung Joo's friend.

253
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:28,677
She's very smart.

254
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:29,811
Say hi, Hye Jeong.

255
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:34,016
She got full marks in the SAT and won many math olympiads.

256
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:35,484
She holds a Myoungjeong scholarship.

257
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,919
Hello.

258
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:42,791
Hye Jeong, can you show me the books you've been studying with?

259
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,661
Oh, yes, yes. Come this way.

260
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:53,769
Let me see.

261
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:58,240
You have lovely handwriting.

262
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:03,512
It helps to go over the basics many times.

263
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:06,081
I went back to middle school math a lot.

264
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:07,816
Really?

265
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:10,218
So it wasn't wrong at all.

266
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:16,658
Let's work a bit more on factorization.

267
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,861
If you can't factorize, equations will be hard to solve,

268
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:22,597
and then linear and quadratic functions will be really hard.

269
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:24,900
To be good at factorization...

270
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:26,902
Look.

271
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:30,439
Myoungjeong Group consists of the hospital and medical foundation.

272
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,974
It looks like she stepped away...

273
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,910
from management to research,

274
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:38,747
but President Myung is the actual operator.

275
00:24:39,748 --> 00:24:42,818
When JK Bio merges with Myoungjeong Research Center...

276
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,853
that researches artificial internal organs...

277
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,855
and stem cell cures,

278
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:50,158
we hope to turn a profit and expand our bio research capabilities.

279
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:55,197
What's the most promising thing they're working on?

280
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:57,199
A new stem cell treatment for atopy.

281
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:00,435
If the clinical studies are clear, they'll go on sale in the fall.

282
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:02,104
That's too late.

283
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,675
What about the potter?

284
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:08,710
I heard Seok Woo's seeing her again.

285
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:13,548
I confirmed that she ended things first with him.

286
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:16,151
The vice chairman isn't contacting her either.

287
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,636
I am well-aware of your capability.

288
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,940
But you tend to cause some chatter while doing your business.

289
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:41,676
The matter regarding the shares under borrowed names has surfaced.

290
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:44,079
I'm quite uneasy about that.

291
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,348
I'm sorry.

292
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,119
Please, you don't need to treat me so formally.

293
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:53,688
I will treat you casually after you become my family.

294
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:56,625
And as of now, you're not my employee either.

295
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,759
Aren't I right?

296
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,295
You're right.

297
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:03,498
I heard you're running clinical trials for a new drug.

298
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,034
I will keep my eye on it once it gets released.

299
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,837
I hope that you will produce a great result so it can silence...

300
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:12,040
the matter regarding the shares under borrowed names.

301
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:14,910
- Mom. - This is about our business.

302
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:19,981
Your effort will be compensated.

303
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:24,452
Depending on the result, I plan to transfer...

304
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,087
a sizable amount of my shares.

305
00:26:26,822 --> 00:26:29,324
And it depends on your performance...

306
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:33,128
whether my shares will be given to Seok Woo...

307
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:35,864
or to my grandchildren, Yeo Min and Si Hyun.

308
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:39,467
Ma'am, I say this with respect,

309
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,937
but if shares are not inherited, there may be a problem with taxes.

310
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:45,106
That's precisely why I said it depends on President Myung.

311
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:46,708
If you're capable,

312
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:51,279
you don't need a lot of shares to run the company.

313
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:52,881
I understand.

314
00:26:53,815 --> 00:26:55,483
I will do my best, ma'am.

315
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,518
Here. It's a present.

316
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:44,032
My gosh, this is good.

317
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,834
You're the daughter of a barista, indeed.

318
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,402
You're great at making coffee.

319
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:49,437
Did you know that Dad isn't teaching anymore?

320
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:51,006
Do you two talk?

321
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:53,742
How could we become strangers to each other?

322
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,678
We have a beautiful daughter together.

323
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:02,918
When you were in the hospital,

324
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:05,654
I was so scared, and it was hard on me,

325
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:07,889
so I called him once.

326
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,592
As soon as he picked up, he said,

327
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:13,495
"The beans I'm roasting right now..."

328
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,096
"are for you."

329
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,333
That sounds like him.

330
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,169
I couldn't bring myself to tell him that you were in a car accident.

331
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:25,507
I told him that he made a great barista.

332
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:29,878
I told him to stay healthy and hung up.

333
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:34,416
Why didn't you tell me that?

334
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:40,689
If you knew, you might've gotten your hopes up.

335
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:46,227
Dad still misses you.

336
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:49,631
I also miss him from time to time.

337
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:52,867
But...

338
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,804
we might be better off this way.

339
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:59,774
When I miss him, I can just see you. I can see his face in yours.

340
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,077
I'm sure he's the same.

341
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:04,479
He can see my face in yours.

342
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:11,953
I'm going back to Icheon.

343
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,822
My exhibit is over.

344
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:15,991
I checked that you're fine.

345
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:19,928
- Okay. - And...

346
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,630
I'm not dating anyone.

347
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:24,566
I came here to tell you that.

348
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:27,602
I wasn't curious.

349
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,171
If I was more like your dad,

350
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:32,774
you would have come see me.

351
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:36,611
Your dad is warmhearted,

352
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:38,880
but I'm coldhearted, aren't I?

353
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,585
You don't look so good.

354
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,453
Are you sick?

355
00:29:47,222 --> 00:29:48,323
No.

356
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:51,026
Did you get dumped?

357
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,762
Nonsense.

358
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,897
I said I'm not dating anyone.

359
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,299
Besides,

360
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,636
I would be the one doing the dumping, not being dumped.

361
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:03,638
Whatever. Good for you.

362
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:06,741
When I return to Icheon, I'll focus on my work.

363
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:08,910
Visit me when you're on break.

364
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:10,378
I'll try.

365
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:12,280
You didn't say no.

366
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,685
Bring your boyfriend if you have one. I'll cook you a nice meal.

367
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,255
You're a bad cook.

368
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:23,425
You have a boyfriend. You do have one.

369
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,493
- No, I don't. - I doubt it.

370
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:27,395
I just told you I don't have one.

371
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:29,631
Who do you think contributed to my lack of dating life?

372
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:32,434
Why are you getting all riled up about this?

373
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:36,071
It's refreshing to hear you say something like that.

374
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:39,474
Whatever. Have your drink, and go.

375
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:41,042
Tae Hee.

376
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:55,023
Thank you so much...

377
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:57,826
for accepting my present.

378
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:07,302
Mr. Yoon.

379
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:10,572
I asked you once why there was no record...

380
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,340
of my mom's car accident.

381
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,842
Yes, you did.

382
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,845
You said you'd look into it, but I haven't heard anything.

383
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:23,184
I know why you didn't tell me anything.

384
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,422
You're worried that...

385
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:30,291
the fact that my mom caused a car accident might shock me.

386
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:33,995
Then answer this, please.

387
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,570
I doubt that you don't know.

388
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,508
I know that the potter and Dad have...

389
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,476
some sort of relationship.

390
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:52,947
My mom said this once.

391
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,951
She said when she's looking at the piece...

392
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:59,888
I feel like I'm the owner of this place.

393
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,662
Now, I understand what she meant.

394
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,167
Did she buy these pieces? Or...

395
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:18,673
You won't answer as expected.

396
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,677
Tell me the connection between...

397
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:25,647
my mom's car accident and the potter.

398
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,685
What connection?

399
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:35,123
Just tell me. Or I'll have to visit her.

400
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:48,803
Your mother...

401
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:52,607
was on her way to meet the potter.

402
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:54,842
She had an accident on her way.

403
00:32:58,546 --> 00:32:59,714
And about the pieces.

404
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,017
The chairwoman instructed to buy her pieces from a long time ago.

405
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:05,420
Grandmother did?

406
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,290
No way.

407
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:12,894
Everyone in my family knew. Everyone except me.

408
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,035
You won't even say hello?

409
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:31,005
No. He shouldn't act like he knows me at all.

410
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,740
It's over between us.
