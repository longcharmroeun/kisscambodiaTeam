1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,778
I think...

2
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,215
I like you already.

3
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,323
Won't you regret it?

4
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:22,726
One,

5
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:24,294
two.

6
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:27,697
(Episode 9)

7
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:57,527
I guess everyone has someone waiting for them.

8
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,396
Good for them.

9
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,805
When are you guys coming over?

10
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:18,481
- Hey, why didn't you reply? - I was already on my way anyway.

11
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,816
You didn't eat yet, right?

12
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,385
I already ate while I was waiting.

13
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,620
Is that so?

14
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,456
Then I should eat these up.

15
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:30,927
Hey, I always have room for dim sum.

16
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,198
No way. Aren't these from that place in Hong Kong?

17
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,801
- I happened to stop by. - Is that why you were late?

18
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,903
Where did you get the money? They took your cards. Did you steal?

19
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,438
Slow down.

20
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:43,440
I have my older brother's card.

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,443
Hey, call him. Tell Si Hyun to hurry.

22
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:48,044
What? Okay.

23
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,948
It's across Si Hyun's place.

24
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:55,085
This is the only available studio.

25
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:58,988
I cleaned the place up and put on the heater too.

26
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:00,990
Let me see.

27
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,995
It stopped working again. What's wrong with this?

28
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:11,301
I was in such a rush earlier, so I forgot to ask you.

29
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,602
What about the contract?

30
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,838
I think I should meet with the landlord first.

31
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,440
Did you not talk to him?

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,975
Sorry?

33
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,844
The owner of this building is...

34
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,445
Sir, sir.

35
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,583
Let me introduce him properly. He's the owner of the building.

36
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,985
You own the whole building? My goodness.

37
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,455
He lets students pay a reasonable rent too.

38
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,825
Thank you so much. How much should I pay for rent?

39
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,794
Sir, isn't it time for you to go home?

40
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:39,496
He doesn't stay late even for a single minute.

41
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,666
Oh, right. I should go. Well, make yourself comfortable.

42
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,903
Let's draw up a contract when we have time. Bye then.

43
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:49,205
- Thank you. - Bye.

44
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,475
Should we move your stuff now?

45
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:55,578
No, no. That's all right. I can take care of them.

46
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:57,947
All right.

47
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,085
Come in if you need anything.

48
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,421
You remember the passcode, right?

49
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,756
Thank you for today.

50
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,229
Why is he my neighbor?

51
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:14,764
My goodness.

52
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,794
My gosh, you look so great even after all you've been through.

53
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,733
Yes, are you still there?

54
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,336
Okay, I'll be there.

55
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,776
I can't today. Okay.

56
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:03,646
My goodness.

57
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:07,083
It was a little too dark in here.

58
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,153
Can you take this and hand me a nipping knife?

59
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,254
What?

60
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,496
No, the one next to that.

61
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:21,164
No, the one over.

62
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:23,166
Yes.

63
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,371
And can you cut some insulation tape in 5cm?

64
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:29,606
Insulation tape?

65
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:31,975
The black tape right there.

66
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:34,644
- This one. - Yes.

67
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:03,706
What?

68
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:09,479
What are you doing?

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,983
Is it because I had the entire bottle?

70
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,585
Yes.

71
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,587
I can take this back to the maintenance, right?

72
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,324
Hey!

73
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,262
I didn't even ask you to do that.

74
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:28,565
I didn't even close the lid. You can't take it back like this.

75
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,501
Tenants are supposed to compensate for the damage.

76
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,236
Silk wallpapers are really expensive.

77
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,138
What are you doing?

78
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,785
I must be insane.

79
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,154
My gosh.

80
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,990
Why did I bring these?

81
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,596
Darn it.

82
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,166
I can't believe how clumsy he is.

83
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,669
Now I can see how he broke that granny's dish.

84
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:08,805
Gosh.

85
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,276
Wait.

86
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,146
He draws well.

87
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,585
Was I too harsh on him?

88
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,655
Goodness, me and my temper.

89
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,466
Eat up.

90
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:39,135
Secretary Yoon got there. I'm sure it's okay.

91
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,571
Si Hyun must've been shocked.

92
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,073
He probably couldn't text me back because he was with the police.

93
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,676
Why are you drinking?

94
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:48,845
It's snowing.

95
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,880
Si Hyun is probably starving at a police station.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,882
How can you drink cognac?

97
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:54,417
You're never serious.

98
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,454
Are you sad? Stop pretending.

99
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:01,924
You always say...

100
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:05,795
that I'm never serious and treat me like dirt.

101
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,333
You wouldn't befriend me if I was serious.

102
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,202
This is how I survive. Just accept me as I am.

103
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:15,405
What was I expecting?

104
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:21,177
My gosh. Everything got cold. There were for you.

105
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:35,224
This is really good.

106
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,995
Did you really get this from the same place? It's different.

107
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,830
It must be the snow.

108
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,199
This is 50,000 times better than eating it there.

109
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,035
Hey, just do what you want.

110
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,805
That's who you are. And I'm your damage control.

111
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:51,741
Whatever.

112
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,076
My goodness.

113
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:55,511
Watch your wrist when you use your fork.

114
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:57,547
Your wrists are very precious.

115
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,785
Why is it so dry in here?

116
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,687
My gosh.

117
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,526
Goodness.

118
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,800
Dip this in water.

119
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:21,804
Good.

120
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,675
You're like a professional cello player.

121
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,912
Pay me. I can be your assistant when you become a celloist.

122
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:32,915
It's cellist, not celloist. And I'm not paying you.

123
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:35,284
I'll get kicked out if I don't make any money.

124
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:37,186
I have to either go to college or make money.

125
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,621
Should I get enlisted?

126
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,823
If you all go to the army, whom will I hang out with?

127
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,060
It's already empty enough without Si Hyun.

128
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:45,995
Get married.

129
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,665
I can only get married after I get you two married.

What was that?

135
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:08,744
Am I sick?

136
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,681
I must've been beaten up pretty badly...

137
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,850
to have messed up my hormone system.

138
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:17,220
Just tell me that you were touched.

139
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,455
No, I wasn't.

140
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:23,226
My mom was like you.

141
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,596
She suddenly cried...

142
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,100
without realizing that she was after listening to me play.

143
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:35,204
She was more flustered than I was.

144
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:44,714
As you know, she's a workaholic.

145
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,685
She studies so hard...

146
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:52,788
to understand what I'm playing.

147
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:57,426
All I want her to do is to listen to me play.

148
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,115
Come out later today.

149
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:21,884
Hye Jeong wants to meet, but I have a lesson.

150
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,986
I can't. I'm very busy.

151
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:26,088
What about you, Si Hyun?

152
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,563
Very busy.

153
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,565
What are you two saying?

154
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,418
Why do you live across the hall?

155
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:10,866
Hey.

156
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,635
Hi.

157
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,975
These must've been heavy.

158
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:20,776
Thanks.

159
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:22,244
For what?

160
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,848
Didn't you give me these?

161
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,895
Didn't you give me these?

162
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,766
It's for new tenants. I got some before too.

163
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,134
Bye.

164
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,878
Why did you just say, "Bye"?

165
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,217
Did she put on makeup?

166
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:03,586
She's so pretty. Gosh, I've gone insane.

167
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,755
My gosh. This is awful.

168
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,663
Yes, Secretary Yoon.

169
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,835
I should've told you before that the building was...

170
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,670
what your mom had left behind for you.

171
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,373
Vice Chairman Kwon wanted me to find a place for you,

172
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,008
so I sent you there.

173
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,610
By the way,

174
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,914
did my mom die in a car accident?

175
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,717
Why would you ask that?

176
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:37,586
I found out at the police station that...

177
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:40,256
there's no record of this car being in an accident.

178
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:42,558
I don't know.

179
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,393
I'll look into it.

180
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,529
Deal with your friend,

181
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:48,097
and call if you need anything.

182
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,865
Won't you see your dad?

183
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,535
I'll just leave.

184
00:13:57,106 --> 00:14:00,242
The chairwoman seems to be very partial about art.

185
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,878
More into pottery than paintings.

186
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:05,247
We have a tea brand.

187
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:08,984
My mother is very much into tea ceremonies.

188
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:13,889
Of course, that's why she'd be interested in pottery.

189
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:20,629
Take your time.

190
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,865
My mother won't be back for a while.

191
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,200
Why rush?

192
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:27,536
There's so much to study.

193
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,911
I don't know much about paintings or music.

194
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,246
I'm trying to keep up.

195
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:38,314
Okay.

196
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:41,083
If you need any information, call Secretary Yoon.

197
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,485
He'll know best.

198
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:45,387
Okay.

199
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,256
I don't know much.

200
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,427
Si Hyun's mom was in charge of all that.

201
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,196
It's okay.

202
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,103
I bought you a few ties.

203
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:04,240
I have a personal shopper.

204
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,375
You needn't worry about this.

205
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:08,744
I wanted to get you something.

206
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,547
I'm allowed to now.

207
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:14,884
Thanks. I'll wear them well.

208
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,594
What do you usually do on weekends?

209
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,496
Not much.

210
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,899
I work or exercise.

211
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,534
What about you?

212
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:34,336
I listen to cello performances.

213
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,405
Nothing much else.

214
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:38,174
Don't you meet friends?

215
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:40,409
For weekend brunch gatherings?

216
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,780
I do have three breakfast meetings a week,

217
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,517
but I never had a social gathering like going out for brunch.

218
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,554
You're just like me.

219
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,088
I guess.

220
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,524
I just noticed.

221
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,495
Let's do it.

222
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:03,999
Isn't it brunch if we meet in the morning and eat together?

223
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,035
This week or anytime.

224
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,706
Okay.

225
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:18,113
There's one thing I want to do. Watch a movie.

226
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,282
Okay.

227
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:22,384
There's one more thing.

228
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:24,453
Have you gone camping before?

229
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:27,556
You cook in these tiny pots and pans,

230
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:31,961
and you drink coffee from a cup with handles that fold back.

231
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,596
We could look up at the sky together.

232
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,431
I didn't expect that from you.

233
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,534
You asked, so I just answered.

234
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:44,340
Si Hyun came and took the car.

235
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,075
What is he up to?

236
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:49,578
- He seems to be doing fine. - Is that what I asked?

237
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:51,714
I asked what he's up to.

238
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:54,583
He asked me about his mother's accident.

239
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,187
If there's anything I must know, please tell me.

240
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,290
- The circumstances? - Why did you send him away?

241
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,193
I know I asked you to take care of my personal matters,

242
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,295
but can't you just stick to doing what you're told?

243
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,264
I don't care what you do...

244
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,867
or where, why, or how you meet other people.

245
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:13,469
I'll keep that in mind.

246
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,044
Eun Tae Hee.

247
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,746
Kyung Joo.

248
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:27,149
- Did you bring your books? - Yes. Right here.

249
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,884
This is it.

250
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:30,719
Let's go.

251
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:50,506
I'm Choi Soo Ji this year.

252
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,708
Will I still be Choi Soo Ji when I graduate?

253
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,356
- Hey. - Where are you? Are you coming?

254
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,124
You're coming?

255
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,094
You can't right now.

256
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,963
What are you talking about? Are you coming?

257
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:19,835
- You slept? - I got up long ago.

258
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,270
What right now?

259
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,638
Right now,

260
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:26,575
- goodbye. - Hey. Hey, you...

261
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:30,446
He's the one who said he'd come over.

262
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:34,883
- Shall we have a drink? - Sure.

263
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,186
You can't even drink that much.

264
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:49,198
Why are you two taking turns blowing me off?

265
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,400
Okay, I'll come over.

266
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,335
Don't wear a jacket. Dress up nicely.

267
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:55,604
What?

268
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,506
Make me look good.

269
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,775
Hey.

270
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,144
I look good in anything.

271
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:07,149
He suddenly put insulation tape on your lips because...

272
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:08,484
Because?

273
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:11,754
Because you drank all the juice.

274
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:15,758
"Would you like some?" That's what you should've said.

275
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,460
That's it, right?

276
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,295
I bet you gave him such a hard time.

277
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,731
Just throw out the old extension cord.

278
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:25,200
Men can't even imagine there are girls like you...

279
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,102
who could even assemble tanks.

280
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:28,704
I didn't give him a hard time.

281
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:31,573
I was so frustrated, but I didn't show it.

282
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,676
Did you even thank him for helping you?

283
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:40,115
Forget about it. These kinds of problems aren't my style.

284
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,284
He hasn't called you yet?

285
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:44,286
He's playing hard to get.

286
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,256
Can someone forget that...

287
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:49,625
they kissed someone?

288
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,393
If he was drunk, yes.

289
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,296
I want to feel what it's like to black out.

290
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:56,198
We didn't drink.

291
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:59,234
It felt real.

292
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:03,405
Did you two kiss?

293
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,774
Someone might hear you.

294
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,676
What was it like?

295
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,145
I don't know.

296
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:14,616
Engineering math is way easier.

297
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,419
Choi Soo Ji.

298
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:19,955
You had a prep class too?

299
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,291
Yes. I got allocated a practice room.

300
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,993
Say hi. This is Tae Hee, she's Soo Ji.

301
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:26,328
Hello.

302
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:29,431
Do you want to come to a fashion show this evening?

303
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:30,632
Se Joo might be there.

304
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,836
What? Yes. I'd like that.

305
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:37,840
I only have one extra ticket. Sorry.

306
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:41,610
I have a part-time job. It's fine.

307
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,078
Just a moment.

308
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,250
The building next to the music hall.

309
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,553
- She's much prettier in real life. - I see you.

310
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,355
You're even prettier.

311
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,225
Isn't that Si Hyun?

312
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,442
- That was quick. - Yes.

313
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:15,344
You came over as soon as I called.

314
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:19,715
You two know each other, don't you?

315
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,785
We meet again.

316
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,354
It's been a while.

317
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,456
Give me that. Let's go.

318
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,862
Kyung Joo, you sit up front. I'll sit beside my cello.

319
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:35,230
Shall I?

320
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,133
The cello takes up a lot of space, but do you want to come along?

321
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,568
No, it's okay.

322
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:41,436
Have fun.

323
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,805
- Let's go. - Sure.

324
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,886
Sorry. I'll call you later.

325
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,851
When you put the cello in the car,

326
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,653
everyone looked at you.

327
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:33,755
You two look so good together.

328
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:37,426
It must be nice to have someone pick you up.

329
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,195
Yes, Si Hyun's very caring.

330
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:41,430
Oh, right.

331
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,033
Tae Hee's terrible at expressing it, but she was so grateful.

332
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:48,503
She said she almost cried with relief when you showed up.

333
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:50,272
I didn't do much.

334
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:52,474
It must have been difficult since it snowed a lot.

335
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,477
Not really.

336
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:00,415
You said you'd help her move.

337
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,051
Was that when it snowed?

338
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,687
Yes. He showed up without notice.

339
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:15,564
He looks so cool.

340
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:42,858
Let me. I'll put this at our place.

341
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:45,327
She must have gotten your attention.

342
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,695
Don't be like that.

343
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:49,431
If not, why would you lie to us that you were at the station...

344
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,866
because of your car?

345
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,135
I didn't lie.

346
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:55,337
My gosh.

347
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,573
You told me not to do this.

348
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:01,943
Hey, good-looking siblings. Look at the camera.

349
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:09,584
Enjoy the fashion show. Bye, Kyung Joo.

350
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:24,032
Earlier at school,

351
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:27,035
it looked like things were awkward between Si Hyun and Tae Hee.

352
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,470
You said he helped her move though.

353
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,672
Why is he playing the game of push and pull?

354
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:32,474
He's stressing Tae Hee out.

355
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,510
What about taking everyone for a trip?

356
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,112
They might get close on the trip.

357
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:38,947
Hey, I like that idea.

358
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,783
But there's no way Tae Hee would agree to go.

359
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,086
Tell her that it's just the two of you.

360
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:46,755
When you two come, Se Joo will make sure it won't get awkward.

361
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:48,390
He's coming too?

362
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,660
Of course. The three of us always move as a package.

363
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,694
Okay, let's go then.

364
00:24:52,694 --> 00:24:54,696
- I'll ask Tae Hee. - Okay.

365
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,736
What's going on? What's wrong with her?

366
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:04,773
I just saw an angel.

367
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,141
- What? - What?

368
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,275
An angel.

369
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:18,453
(Kyung Joo posted a new photo.)

370

00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:35,804
(Real Estate Registry)

372
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:41,676
(Owner: Kwon Si Hyun)

373
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:56,124
Why do I feel like I did something wrong?

374
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:58,627
Why is this bothering me?

375
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,408
Tae Hee, did you eat?

376
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,344
Eat with me.

377
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:21,616
- I don't want to. - Hey, you promised me tangsuyuk.

378
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:26,254
- Fine. I'll buy you tangsuyuk. - Actually, I already ordered it.

379
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:31,793
- Okay. I need to talk to you too. - Put your bag away, and come.

380
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:35,263
What's his problem?

381
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,800
- It's free. Thank you. - Enjoy your food.

382
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,268
This looks really good.

383
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,344
I already paid for it.

384
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,546
You did?

385
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:54,916
- Bye. - Bye.

386
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:07,462
Since this is only temporary, I drew up a standard one.

387
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:10,232
I already asked the foundation to look into this error.

388
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:13,001
- Let's talk after we eat. - No, I want to discuss this...

389
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,736
Your noodles are going to get soggy.

390
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:20,775
- Hey! - What?

391
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:23,912
How could you pour the sauce all over it?

392
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,814
I like dipping the meat into the sauce.

393
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:27,883
I see.

394
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:29,918
Seriously. You're so inconsiderate.

395
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:32,053
How could you pour it without asking?

396
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,124
- Hey, I was just trying to... - How do you expect me to eat this?

397
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:38,727
I'm sorry.

398
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,663
Then do you pour the sauce for the noodles?

399
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:44,299
Of course. How else would I eat my noodles then?

400
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:48,803
Hey, forget it. Leave it.

401
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,308
You know what? Forget it. Give back my tools. I'm going home.

402
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:55,076
They are in the drawer next to my bed.

403
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,246
Why did you put the tools next to your bed?

404
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:10,859
- Should I order another tangsuyuk? - No, I just want my tools back.

405
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:16,197
Do you dip the pickled radish in the vinegar?

406
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,515
I'm leaving.

407
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:36,318
Read the contract, and tell me what you think.

408
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,863
Is that what I think it is?

409
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:52,634
Why did Se Joo, that lunatic, get me so many?

410
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,036
He got me every kind.

411
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:01,109
Gosh!

412
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,980
Why are my ears burning?

413
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,583
Soo Ji said we're going on a trip this weekend. Did you hear?

414
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,952
- For what? - She wants Si Hyun and Tae Hee...

415
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:12,487
to get together.

416
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,523
She said that you're coming too.

417
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,359
Of course, we always do things together.

418
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:21,463
- Wait, are you coming too? - Yes.

419
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:23,131
I can't wait.

420
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:27,035
Don't you think we'll learn more about each other?

421
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:29,871
- We will? - That's why I prepared this.

422
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:32,907
Let's watch this together at night.

423
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:35,276
"At night"?

424
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,178
Okay.

425
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,448
Open it after I get off.

426
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:42,317
Bye.

427
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:51,826
I can't believe this. I grabbed his hand.

428
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:58,867
("I Give My First Love to You")

429
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:03,171
No! This is even creepier!

430
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:06,775
What happens when we watch it? What? First love?

431
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:09,778
How should I handle this?

432
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:13,915
To stop her from coming on this trip...

433
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:17,485
Yes, there's a way.

434
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,095
Kyung Joo.

435
00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:29,998
We cooked cockles. Your favorite. Try this.

436
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:33,401
Mom, I'm going on a diet.

437
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,702
I won't eat it.

438
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,173
We cooked this for you. Just try one.

439
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:39,874
I said I can't.

440
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:42,043
Don't make me eat this.

441
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,148
Okay.

442
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:52,187
Bing Bing.

443
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,923
Put these in the refrigerator.

444
00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,828
Okay.

445
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,502
If you help me one more time,

446
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:09,904
you can have whatever you want.

447
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:13,808
No one can give me what I want.

448
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:17,579
He's dead.

449
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:21,216
Oh, dear.

450
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,454
If I get a chance to see him dance just one more time,

451
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:28,756
how great would that be?

452
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:33,895
I don't know who he is,

453
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:37,398
but he must have been happy to be loved by you.

454
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,368
He was my Leslie Cheung.

455
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:27,815
Tae Hee.

456
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:29,150
What is it?

457
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,753
You said you'd help me get close to Se Joo.

458
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:35,223
What is this about?

459
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,892
I'm going to his family's cottage. Come with me.

460
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,661
No, I don't want to. Why would I go there?

461
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:42,630
Tae Hee, come on. Just this once. You promised to help.

462
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,665
No.

463
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:46,401
Other people will come with us, so it will be okay. Please?

464
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,403
Please come with me.

465
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:50,705
My gosh.

466
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,978
But where is Tae Hee staying now?

467
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,013
Hey.

468
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:06,521
- Where is she staying now? - I don't know.

469
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:08,623
You said you helped her move. How could you not know?

470
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,791
You did?

471
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,293
Well... She found a new place.

472
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,264
Then our bet isn't over yet. Right?

473
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:21,035
By the way, where is her new place?

474
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,905
- Did you take her to your place? - You crazy jerk.

475
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,176
According to Kyung Joo, you're playing hard-to-get.

476
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:32,513
You wanted her to fall madly in love with me.

477
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,984
To make that happen, I can't be easy like this jerk here.

478
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,153
There's no need to criticize me.

479
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:46,894
Let's go on a trip with Tae Hee.

480
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:50,365
It's been a while since we've gone on one.

481
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:53,935
No, let's just go by ourselves. Why would we bring in others?

482
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:57,472
Hey, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't drag this out.

483
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:01,209
After seducing her, date her. After dating her, get things going.

484
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:04,412
We won't say anything if you disappear with her at night.

485
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:05,813
Get lost.

486
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:08,583
Don't you like my plan?

487
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,518
No.

488
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,787
I don't want others to join us either.

489
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:14,956
You and I don't know anything about her.

490
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:17,025
But why don't you like his plan, Si Hyun?

491
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,527
Do you not want to finish your job?

492
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:22,563
Or are you seriously interested in her?

493
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,232
You two keep talking nonsense.

494
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:26,401
Hey, let's just go. Get close to her on the trip.

495
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:29,003
Have brunch with her without Soo Ji and me.

496
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:31,973
What?

497
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:34,075
But isn't that what you want?

498
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,844
You want to break Tae Hee's heart.

499
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,254
Tae Hee says she'll come. But make it look like a coincidence.

500
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:50,024
I should tell Kyung Joo to bring Tae Hee.

501
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,693
You're fine with that, right, Se Joo?

502
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,961
Of course. Tell her to come.

503
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,563
Tell everyone to come.

504
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:58,132
I made myself clear that I just want the three of us on the trip.
