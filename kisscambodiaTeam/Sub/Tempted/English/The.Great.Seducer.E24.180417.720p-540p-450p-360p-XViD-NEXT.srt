1
00:00:06,243 --> 00:00:07,310
That woman...

2
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:09,613
is your mother.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,082
Potter Seol Young Won.

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:15,719
Your mom knows that Si Hyun's dad's getting remarried.

5
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:17,621
(Episode 24)

6
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:19,289
Did you hear that too?

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,725
Si Hyun's mom died...

8
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:26,329
in an accident two years ago while going to see your mom.

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,940
Whether you love him or not, I won't get involved.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,576
But leave our family alone.

11
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:43,346
It's just not fair if Si Hyun's mom and then mine...

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,616
has to suffer because of yours.

13
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:51,955
My mom did nothing wrong.

14
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:17,280
Where are we?

15
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:20,684
The outskirts of Seoul. I'll go to Myoungjeong Hospital.

16
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:24,587
- Let's go to work. - Go to the hospital.

17
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:29,159
I'm just overworked.

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,729
The lady told me to take care of you...

19
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:35,365
because you hide it when you're sick...

20
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:37,067
and deal with it alone.

21
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,104
It's nothing serious.

22
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:43,006
Take me to work.

23
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:48,745
Do you hate me for visiting her?

24
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:52,982
No.

25
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:56,820
It's all my fault.

26
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:15,238
(Kwon Si Hyun)

27
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:26,950
I found out...

28
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,887
who my dad is seeing.

29
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:32,889
You must hate her.

30
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:36,559
I want to give her a hard time.

31
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:40,530
I want you to do only what makes you happy.

32
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,199
I can't believe...

33
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,369
I said that to you.

34
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:53,009
(Kwon Si Hyun)

35
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,220
Si Hyun's mom died...

36
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:08,625
in an accident two years ago while going to see your mom.

37
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:15,131
I'm going back to Icheon.

38
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:17,634
I'm not seeing anyone.

39
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,869
I came to tell you that.

40
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,822
I thought she only gave Dad a hard time.

41
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:44,527
I thought only Dad and I suffered.

42
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:56,739
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,677
I'm sorry, Si Hyun.

44
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:35,712
(Eun Tae Hee)

45
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:40,216
The phone is turned off.

46
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,985
Please leave a message after the tone.

47
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,586
Why can't I reach her?

48
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:44,787
Your call will be charged.

49
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:54,864
Tae Hee, I'm in Seoul.

50
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,100
Why is your phone turned off?

51
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,270
Call me when you see this. Okay?

52
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,847
Excuse me.

53
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,917
I was wondering if Eun Tae Hee was still working.

54
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,085
She left right after work.

55
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:18,421
Thank you.

56
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:47,984
Is her name Soo Ji?

57
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,087
You should teach her some manners.

58
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,523
I apologize.

59
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,361
Who does she think she is to tell me to study abroad?

60
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,839
You walked in here as if you knew I'd be here.

61
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,542
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

62
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:14,177
Why?

63
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:17,614
And just now, I couldn't even reach your phone.

64
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:19,349
Do you think I'd want to talk to you...

65
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,050
after what your grandma has said to me?

66
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,587
Let me ask you a question. Did you...

67
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:27,523
know everything when you told me?

68
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,093
Did you know...

69
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,030
Seol Young Won was Tae Hee's mom when you told me?

70
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,733
- Yes. - What?

71
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:42,338
Should I have told you that she's Tae Hee's mom?

72
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,541
Why should I?

73
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,914
How could you do this to me?

74
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,653
You knew that I was seeing her and that I liked her!

75
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,589
I even told you that I was going to apologize to her.

76
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,224
You wanted to know.

77
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:04,661
Don't you remember shouting at me, asking who that woman was?

78
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:07,096
Mr. Kwon is seeing someone else.

79
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,836
Your dad is seeing another woman.

80
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,974
Where did you see them? How did you find out?

81
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:19,409
- I... - Who is she?

82
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:25,948
Let me make myself clear.

83
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:29,052
I found out that she's Tae Hee's mom much later.

84
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,921
And I hinted many times that you should break up with her.

85
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:33,056
But you didn't...

86
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,526
care about me or my mom because you were head over heels for her.

87
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:39,362
You didn't care what happened to us because of your family.

88
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:43,666
Tae Hee.

89
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:45,401
Tae Hee...

90
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,904
Did you tell Tae Hee too?

91
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:58,648
Hey.

92
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,653
What's with you, really?

93
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:08,091
This is between you and me.

94
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:12,228
Why did you bring her into this?

95
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:16,666
Are you saying I was brutal to her?

96
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,901
- Choi Soo Ji. - Si Hyun.

97
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,173
Get a hold of yourself.

98
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:28,411
To her, you're the jerk, not me. Don't you get it?

99
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,048
You're the one who started this game.

100
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,984
You're the one who suggested and wanted...

101
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,986
to get married before our parents did.

102
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:40,289
And all I've done is wage a bet called Eun Tae Hee.

103
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:44,927
I told you about Seol Young Won because you wanted to know.

104
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,663
I only told Tae Hee because I had to protect my mom.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,635
How much does she know?

106
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:55,505
Don't worry.

107
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,040
I didn't tell her about our game.

108
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:02,178
I told her that I didn't care if she came between our friendship,

109
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,947
but that she couldn't come between us as siblings.

110
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,552
Siblings? Friendship?

111
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,057
Friendship between us?

112
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,529
That doesn't exist anymore.

113
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,808
Goodbye, Kwon Si Hyun.

114
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,391
Tae Hee. Are you in there?

115
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,394
We need to talk. Please.

116
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,429
(Engineering Building 1)

117
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:33,936
Did you check?

118
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,273
- Tae Hee. - Tae Hee, what brings you here?

119
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:39,442
- Are you going to work overnight? - Yes.

120
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:42,078
You always worked at home. What's going on?

121
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,780
I'm going to work overnight.

122
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,416
I couldn't focus at home.

123
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,052
We're going to get some late night snacks. Come with us.

124
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,754
I'm fine.

125
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:53,789
Come on.

126
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,191
I already had some.

127
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,326
Enjoy.

128
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,766
Where are you?

129
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,193
Hey, Tae Hee.

130
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,162
Hey, Kyung Joo.

131
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:35,998
Where are you? Why was your phone turned off?

132
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,368
What's up?

133
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:42,405
Si Hyun called me many times, looking for you.

134
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:47,276
- Really? - Did you two fight?

135
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:48,678
Kyung Joo.

136
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,781
When Si Hyun calls you,

137
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:56,419
tell him you don't know where I am. I have something on my mind.

138
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,156
What's going on? Come to my house.

139
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:01,791
Or should I come over?

140
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,927
No. I need to be alone.

141
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,397
I'm trying not to see Si Hyun.

142
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:12,335
That's why I turned off my phone. Don't worry about me.

143
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:15,438
Okay.

144
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:18,407
I'll call you at school.

145
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:30,786
Si Hyun.

146
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,423
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:42,298
But it's really hard for me to see you right now.

148
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:01,584
If you don't want to go home, let's go over to our hideout.

149
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:04,553
I don't want to go there.

150
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,558
Should we get rid of that place?

151
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:13,996
Why?

152
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:18,300
Where else can I go to get some rest?

153
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:20,536
Si Hyun left.

154
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:22,905
Soo Ji.

155
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,174
Si Hyun left.

156
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,543
We can't go back to how we used to be.

157
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,150
I know that.

158
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,422
I made it that way.

159
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,028
You.

160
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:49,632
You need to stop ignoring me and take a look at me.

161
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,168
Be with me.

162
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:54,804
I'll do everything you want.

163
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,775
You said I'm annoying because I know you so well.

164
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,044
I'll feign ignorance at times.

165
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:04,547
If you can't be bothered, I'll stay away for days.

166
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,248
If you call, I'll show right up.

167
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,051
That's what I did until now.

168
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:12,822
From now on, I'll do more than that.

169
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,059
You and I...

170
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:22,031
should just stay friends, Se Joo.

171
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,912
Si Hyun's just a friend too.

172
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:40,916
Can't we be happy like him?

173
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,925
Si Hyun isn't happy.

174
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,796
I just tore them apart.

175
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,800
But I'm not happy either.

176
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:01,170
Tae Hee said that...

177
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:05,174
I'm not angry but sad.

178
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:10,946
She said I looked sad because...

179
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,349
Si Hyun doesn't love me.

180
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,552
What's up?

181
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,388
Is this where Tae Hee lives?

182
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,525
- Why? - Let's go out.

183
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:06,669
It's so annoying.

184
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,637
I have to start seeing a shrink.

185
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:10,272
I'm not crazy.

186
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:12,441
It's much better than enlisting.

187
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,777
A lot of my relatives should've served but didn't.

188
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:16,812
I know.

189
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,448
You haven't suffered in your life.

190
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:20,783
Stop it.

191
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,284
- Stop what? - Hey.

192
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:26,155
Drink up. Talking to a shrink will get really annoying.

193
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,924
Cheers.

194
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:32,995
What's that?

195
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,530
Are you buying?

196
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,532
My brother-in-law will.

197
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,267
Drink some more.

198
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,069
Call if you need something.

199
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:44,540
Speak. I know you want to vent for what I said to Soo Ji.

200
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,677
I'm thinking of shutting down our hideout.

201
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:50,446
Do it.

202
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:53,649
We'll never gather like we used to.

203
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,818
It was your place anyway.

204
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:57,019
Do whatever you want.

205
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,888
You sound more indifferent than I had expected.

206
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,423
What has changed has changed.

207
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,759
Soo Ji and I went to...

208
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,527
your place last night.

209
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:08,530
That's when you saw me and Tae Hee.

210
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:12,735
I don't know why, but she called, crying in the middle of the night.

211
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:16,338
I think her mom told her something.

212
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,908
She got scared for you and wanted to check on you right away.

213
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,811
That's when we found out you two were neighbors.

214
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,881
How do you think Soo Ji felt?

215
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,086
To be honest,

216
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,623
when you lied to us about dating Tae Hee,

217
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:36,492
I decided to hit on Soo Ji.

218
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:40,329
I wanted to be honest to myself even if it was one-sided,

219
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:43,232
but Soo Ji wants us to stay friends.

220
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,301
What do you think that means?

221
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:47,770
Any other relationship changes.

222
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,040
You know what she's like.

223
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,143
She's like that because she's barely hanging on.

224
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,980
Because she loses everything and will be lonely without me.

225
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:03,519
Se Joo.

226
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:06,955
I can't reach Tae Hee.

227
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:12,361
Do you know what Soo Ji told her today?

228
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:14,463
- I do. - What?

229
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,032
Your parents, Tae Hee's mom.

230
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,802
- I knew that already. - Hey.

231
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,506
Then you should've told me...

232
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:26,041
or stopped Soo Ji.

233
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,310
I warned you many times.

234
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:32,548
To end it with Tae Hee or tell Soo Ji clearly how you feel.

235
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:34,016
You didn't do that.

236
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:38,220
What am I supposed to do?

237
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:41,023
What can I do to appease you two?

238
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,859
I'm going insane here.

239
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:47,363
I know what we started was wrong.

240
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,832
I was going to ask for Tae Hee's forgiveness,

241
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:52,735
- but Soo Ji ruined my chances. - Don't blame her.

242
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,237
Don't you know why she's like this?

243
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:58,707
She stopped you from going too far by telling Tae Hee the facts.

244
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:00,008
Se Joo.

245
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,747
Soo Ji isn't the girl I used to know.

246
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,682
How can you say that?

247
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,618
You made her like this.

248
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:12,955
How many things did you put Soo Ji through?

249
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:15,324
Stop it. I know all that.

250
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:18,894
But that's her position.

251
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,429
What, you jerk?

252
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:22,598
Hey.

253
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,368
Don't you show yourself in front of her again.

254
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,004
If you upset her again,

255
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:31,707
who knows what I'll do then?

256
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,941
Hang on.

257
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,777
Is that Se Joo?

258
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,546
It is your brother.

259
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,181
What a nutjob.

260
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:42,084
At home, he talks about being nonviolent.

261
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:43,285
Hey.

262
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:45,554
What are you doing?

263
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:47,790
Why fight with your best friend?

264
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,626
I'll buy you a drink.

265
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:54,029
We'll have... Wait, Si Hyun.

266
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,466
Isn't this where you passed out drugged?

267
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,536
- You came back here? - Go on your way.

268
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,304
Watch your manners.

269
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:06,909
Not bad.

270
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:08,644
Si Hyun.

271
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:12,281
I'm giving you some advice.

272
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,550
Why were you fighting?

273
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:16,618
Was it about Soo Ji?

274
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:21,723
I knew it. Men and women can't just be friends.

275
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:22,791
Right.

276
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,861
Soo Ji does have a way of flirting and luring men.

277
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:29,431
Don't you dare mention her, and just go your way!

278
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,233
You fool.

279
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:50,686
I'm not sick, Mom.

280
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:51,753
Hello.

281
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:53,789
Say hello.

282
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,858
Hello.

283
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:57,326
Welcome, Kyu Jeong.

284
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,127
(Stress, Psychology Clinic)

285
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,703
I know your goal is to keep him out of the army,

286
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:10,072
but our priority will be to treat him.

287
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,807
Thank you, President Myung.

288
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:14,643
We'll follow your lead, so do help us out.

289
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:19,548
Tell me if you need to meet Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol,

290
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:23,118
my cousin's husband again. I'll help as best I can.

291
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:25,087
Okay.

292
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:27,456
I saw the emergency CT.

293
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,692
There seems to be a tumor in your brain.

294
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,227
A tumor?

295
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,998
You'll need to get some detailed tests,

296
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,467
but the tumor lies across your optic nerves.

297
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:42,371
Even if it's benign, you must have had symptoms.

298
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:46,108
I thought it was something an eye doctor could treat.

299
00:21:57,586 --> 00:21:58,787
Excuse me.

300
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,461
President Myung.

301
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,630
I need your help as a doctor.

302
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:10,599
Schedule me for some tests.

303
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,968
What's going on?

304
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:15,203
Are you sick?

305
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,806
Let's discuss the details in person.

306
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:31,019
Eun Tae Hee, you didn't go home last night?

307
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,224
I ended up sleeping over while doing some work.

308
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,238
Where is she if she isn't home?

309
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:58,981
(Missed call from Kwon Si Hyun)

310
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,588
(Dad)

311
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,526
- Dad. - What's up, Tae Hee?

312
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:15,130
It must be morning over there. Aren't you busy?

313
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,566
Your daughter is always busy.

314
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,870
The cherry blossoms are so pretty, so I wanted to show them.

315
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:28,577
- Aren't they pretty? - They are.

316
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,581
They're prettier in person.

317
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:33,949
Tae Hee.

318
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,451
I'll be in Korea next week.

319
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:38,353
Can we meet up?

320
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:40,288
What for?

321
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:42,224
To see you.

322
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,827
I have business there too.

323
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:47,629
Dad.

324
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:51,500
Can I stay wherever you're staying?

325
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,802
I would love to have you around.

326
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:57,139
I didn't bring it up because I thought you might get annoyed.

327
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,840
It's great news for me.

328
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,777
What about your dormitory? Are you allowed to stay out?

329
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:03,045
Of course.

330
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,280
I'll tell them that I'm going home for a while.

331
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:07,849
Dad.

332
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,485
Look at this.

333
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:12,888
This is the prettiest cherry blossom tree around here.

334
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,058
I always come here whenever I'm at school.

335
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:17,159
Tae Hee.

336
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,961
Are you sure you're showing me the flowers?

337
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:21,530
What?

338
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:24,566
Who's that guy behind you?

339
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,468
Why is that guy staring at you...

340
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:28,737
instead of looking at the flowers?

341
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:32,374
Is this your way of showing me your boyfriend?

342
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:39,581
Tae Hee.

343
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:43,752
I know what happened yesterday.

344
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:49,357
I'm not sure how I should start talking,

345
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,196
but I just found out yesterday...

346
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,233
that she was your mom.

347
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:04,339
Si Hyun.

348
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:07,042
Let's not say the things...

349
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,244
that are too tough to bring up.

350
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:12,581
We already know how our relationship...

351
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:14,783
got complicated.

352
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:17,786
What's more important is...

353
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:19,888
how much...

354
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:23,592
you and I have suffered because of them two.

355
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:30,532
I'm so sorry.

356
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:32,567
Why are you sorry?

357
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,303
If I never showed up in your life,

358
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:37,973
everything would've been fine.

359
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:42,544
You probably never had to find out,

360
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:44,346
but everything came out...

361
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,515
because of me.

362
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:48,583
No, like you said,

363
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:50,552
this isn't your fault.

364
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:52,988
You said you're fine because you met me.

365
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,290
I did.

366
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,325
But...

367
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,328
it's really hard for me...

368
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,464
to see you right now.

369
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,503
Look at me, will you?

370
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,041
I still have a lot of things to say to you...

371
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,210
and a lot of things to apologize for.

372
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,613
Please don't turn away from me.

373
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:26,788
Si Hyun.

374
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:30,091
Let us...

375
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,328
not see each other anymore.

376
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:36,264
No.

377
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,770
What will I do if I don't have you?

378
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:44,472
Please.

379
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,509
It's because this is too hard for me.

380
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,512
I would feel like a sinner...

381
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:53,682
if I kept seeing you.

382
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:01,790
Thank you for everything.
