00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,579
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,249
Let's go. I'm hungry.

3
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:13,617
Si Hyun, come on.

4
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:15,151
Is Soo Ji coming?

5
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,220
No idea. She told me to hang up because she's busy.

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,490
Why? Do you have something to say to her?

7
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,361
You two are going to make up today, okay?

8
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,864
Let's go.

9
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,069
Hey, you two. Make friends.

10
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,808
If you two don't make up,

11
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:40,810
I'm making you two go to a corner to hug it out.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,845
- You're insane. - So insane.

13
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:44,014
I'm the only one who's concerned about you two.

14
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:45,415
Eat this.

15
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,350
You need to eat a lot now to go on a hunger strike later.

16
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:48,418
What?

17
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:52,322
Going against your parents' marriage. The hunger strike.

18
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,424
He's not going to see Tae Hee anymore.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,927
Really?

20
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:00,263
- Why? - Yes, I'm going to stop.

21
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:01,631
So why?

22
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:03,233
It's too tiring and not fun.

23
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,102
Si Hyun, do you think our bet is a joke?

24
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,504
Is it that easy?

25
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,340
Stop it. Tell him to just starve to death.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,108
Even if they do end up getting married,

27
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,478
I begged them to keep the house that you lived with your mom.

28
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,748
You're saying you want to give up just because it's not fun.

29
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,450
Get up and answer me.

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,851
I know.

31
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,822
I know that you did that for me, and I'm sorry.

32
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:31,261
She doesn't like me. What can I do now?

33
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,697
Wow, how can she not like you?

34
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,098
I'll date her.

35
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:38,201
I'm so curious about this girl who turned you down.

36
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:41,471
Stop lying. You aren't Se Joo.

37
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:44,207
Why did you get turned down? You're Si Hyun, not Se Joo.

38
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:46,309
I get it. Take a breath.

39
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:49,112
I can't take a breath. I don't understand this.

40
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:52,816
Well, it's...

41
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:58,355
I made a mistake. She told me to get lost.

42
00:01:58,355 --> 00:01:59,889
What did you do so wrong?

43
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,125
Gather around.

44
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,095
Si Hyun, you can stop only after you finish the plan.

45
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:06,529
- What? - What?

46
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,299
The move.

47
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,302
We canceled her move-in to Myoungjeong Dormitory.

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,139
Am I the only one who remembers this?

49
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:18,007
- Have you two forgotten? - No.

50
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,578
Can she not try to get in again?

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,748
Are you kidding me?

52
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:27,650
Why? You must be worried.

53
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:31,020
You look like you want to rush over to help.

54
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,224
I'll go if you tell me to.

55
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:35,325
What?

56
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,962
I'll go if you want me to, not because I'm worried about her.

57
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,901
I'm about to go near your office. Do you want to grab dinner?

58
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,870
I just had dinner.

59
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:49,372
Really?

60
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:52,108
You didn't text me back today,

61
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,711
so I decided to drive here.

62
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you want to come out if you aren't too busy?

63
00:02:58,248 --> 00:02:59,816
I don't want to eat alone.

64
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,251
Oh, I'm sorry.

65
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,154
I still have some things to do.

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,489
Okay, then. Keep it up.

67
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,192
Okay. Goodbye.

68
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,106
Secretary Lee.

69
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,575
Let's continue working tomorrow.

70
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:29,412
You may go home. You can let the driver go too.

71
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:31,247
Sorry? Okay.

72
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,149
But Vice Chairman Kwon, how will you get home?

73
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,151
I know how to take the subway.

74
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,220
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,008
This wind. These lights.

76
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,311
I must've been a vampire in my past life.

77
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,579
Why do I love nights so much?

78
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,681
Vampires don't have a past life.

79
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,383
Their immortality ends when they become dust in the sunlight.

80
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,952
Soo Ji, aren't I right?

81
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:14,958
All women love vampires.

82
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,627
I mean, look at all these movies, not just classical books.

83
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:19,395
There's "Interview with the Vampire"...

84
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:23,800
and my brother Jim Jarmusch's "Only Lovers Left Alive".

85
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,902
It's cold. Roll up the window.

86
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,337
Should I?

87
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,007
Stop!

88
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,810
Cut right here.

89
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,281
This is why we must come out at night.

90
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,950
The early bird only catches insects,

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,020
but come out at night, and you catch something to live off of forever.

92
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,088
Look.

93
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,961
Friends, I have to leave you.

94
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:54,397
- Hey, you're getting out? - Where are you going?

95
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,402
My dear brother, what are you doing here?

96
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:01,838
- Is he someone you know? - Oh yes.

97
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:04,541
He gets really lucky sometimes.

98
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,577
He made me come out in the cold, and he abandoned us.

99
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,079
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

100
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,214
Want to sit up front?

101
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:39,008
I saw a photo of you as a kid today.

102
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,144
Why didn't you say you knew the home...

103
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,148
No, no.

104
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:51,120
I think I got you very wrong.

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,255
Sorry.

106
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:15,778
You can ask anything you want.

107
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,146
You'd have a lot of questions.

108
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,648
Do you live in Seoul?

109
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:20,550
No, my workroom in Icheon.

110
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:23,219
I'm staying with Geum Sil while the exhibition's on.

111
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,190
My daughter goes to university in Seoul. She's a freshman.

112
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,959
She still hates me.

113
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,962
Your son's the same age. You'll know what they're like.

114
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,898
Her dad still lives abroad,

115
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,334
and I think he's in touch with her.

116
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:41,471
I'm sure he's fine, and I'm doing fine here.

117
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:44,207
- I see. - Gosh.

118
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,510
I thought you'd ask if I waited for a long time that day.

119
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,779
I don't deserve to ask.

120
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,650
I knew you'd become a vice chairman.

121
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,652
And a few other things about you.

122
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,121
- How? - You're famous.

123
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,522
Even if I don't want to know,

124
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,624
I read about you in magazines at the hair salon...

125
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:04,127
or in the newspaper's economy section.

126
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,899
I found out your wife had died a few months too late.

127
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,003
That's why you didn't show up.

128
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:16,072
It made sense.

129
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,141
For those few months,

130
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,443
you must've blamed me.

131
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,780
I wasn't in the right mind to.

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,350
My daughter was very sick then because of a car accident.

133
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,821
I thought many times...

134
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,322
how nice it would've been...

135
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:36,759
if you had come to see me that day.

136
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,828
If I hadn't been home,

137
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:41,698
then I wouldn't have fought with my daughter.

138
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:45,768
Her mom lost her mind waiting for a man who never showed up...

139
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,072
and had no idea her daughter had run off crying.

140
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,147
I'm blaming myself, not you.

141
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:00,450
It's okay, it's all in the past.

142
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,722
Did you suffer a lot too?

143
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,958
Your son. How is he?

144
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,632
This place...

145
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,268
hasn't changed much, has it?

146
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,704
No, it has changed.

147
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,541
I came by sometimes.

148
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:28,344
Gosh. I couldn't come in.

149
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,180
Even if I were nearby, I just got upset and passed by.

150
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,989
You know, we both barely managed to move on.

151
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,191
We parted 20 years ago...

152
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,660
and failed to meet up a few years ago.

153
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,096
I realized something after that.

154
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,698
If we...

155
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,335
missed out on meeting each other that many times,

156
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,771
we're not meant to be.

157
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,909
But still, we met again now.

158
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:02,845
Yes.

159
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,715
And this is it.

160
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:08,618
I wanted to see you once.

161
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:11,087
Whenever that may be,

162
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:14,157
I wanted to tell you what I just did.

163
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:18,494
Some days, I wanted to blame you.

164
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:21,430
And at times, I wanted to say I missed you.

165
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,866
That day two years ago,

166
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,736
I thought I should tell you everything I'd bottled up.

167
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,338
I wondered how many nights and days that would take.

168
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,742
That's what I thought while waiting for you.

169
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,078
But look.

170
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:38,080
It took just three minutes.

171
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:44,420
Now that we're older, we needn't say too much.

172
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,459
It's tough.

173
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,096
Let's not do it again.

174
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,801
Do you get my point?

175
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,207
Yes.

176
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,743
We shouldn't do it again.

177
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:13,482
Your number.

178
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,354
- What? - Give me your number.

179
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:22,692
What? What's there to say at our age? Give me your number.

180
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:25,661
You haven't changed at all. You're still stubborn and unruly.

181
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:27,697
Do your colleagues know you're like this?

182
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:00,529
That's enough for tonight. I'll take you home.

183
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,300
Secretary Yoon, you think...

184
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,569
I'm quite pitiful.

185
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:10,172
That's why you're here, unable to go home.

186
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:16,412
Don't look at me like that.

187
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,201
Why keep it from Se Joo?

188
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,670
Keep what?

189
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,338
Our bet.

190
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,075
He thinks the loser will go on a hunger strike.

191
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:49,912
Why do you care? You want to quit.

192
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,417
He might get upset if he finds out later on.

193
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:57,687
He was there when we first discussed...

194
00:11:57,687 --> 00:11:59,855
getting married before our parents do.

195
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,692
Is that what you care about right now?

196
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,928
I just don't get it.

197
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,203
Choi Soo Ji!

198
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,340
Choi Soo Ji.

199
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:20,209
What's gotten into you?

200
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,478
What if you get hurt?

201
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:25,281
You're worried Se Joo will feel hurt.

202
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,917
What about me? Do you not care about me?

203
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,118
Why did I not tell him?

204
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:31,721
I felt embarrassed, that's why.

205
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:35,458
I'm already embarrassed that my mom's getting married.

206
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,592
What else should I say?

207
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:38,427
My mom's getting married for money,

208
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,696
but I value my pride, so I made a wager?

209
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:43,599
Why are you saying that? Why feel embarrassed around us?

210
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,201
Do you know how I feel?

211
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,470
You have no worries at all.

212
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,372
You can live in comfort...

213
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:52,708
then move back into the house I groveled to keep my mom out of.

214
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:55,811
Only I have to suffer being sandwiched between them two.

215
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,613
That's why I'm overreacting like this!

216
00:12:57,613 --> 00:13:00,182
Why are you saying things like that?

217
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,586
- Listen to me. - I don't care now.

218
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,821
Whether they get married or not,

219
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:08,958
what my mom does to you is not my concern anymore.

220
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,361
Don't try to comfort me or pretend that you understand.

221
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:14,330
Don't do anything!

222
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,341
Can't you just...

223
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,910
believe in how I feel?

224
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:31,680
Eun Tae Hee...

225
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:34,550
has nothing to do with us.

226
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,088
She does now.

227
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,725
I see it in your eyes.

228
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,761
What does she have to do with us? What do you see?

229
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:49,198
- You were worried about her. - Why would I be?

230
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,834
I forgot about her moving day. You know that.

231
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:55,671
I got riled up and left because...

232
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,239
you told me to go after her if I were worried.

233
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:03,012
Will you listen to me, Soo Ji?

234
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:06,115
You'll catch a cold. Let's go.

235
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,232
Look at me.

236
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:29,071
Look at me.

237
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:30,940
Tell me what you want to say.

238
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:41,417
I won't make you feel sad...

239
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,819
or depressed anymore.

240
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,226
My dad will treat you well.

241
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:53,162
And if they're happy together, that's what's important.

242
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:56,432
You don't have to be concerned. You can do whatever you want to do.

243
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,167
Is that still not enough?

244
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,471
- What about you? - What?

245
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,109
Why do you say this like you aren't going to be there?

246
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,114
I have to go to the army.

247
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,083
Come visit me.

248
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,286
Only then will I be able to be on your side when I come back.

249
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:19,421
- Move it. - Soo Ji.

250
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:22,224
You need to think in simpler terms.

251
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,961
Why are you worried about so many things with your tiny head?

252
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:27,997
Stop it.

253
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,331
What?

254
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:31,066
Stop doing...

255
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,571
these things to me.

256
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:41,477
Okay.

257
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:03,699
Hey.

258
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:08,837
If you try to act like you're my older brother, I'll kill you.

259
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,209
Of course. I wouldn't do that.

260
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:16,178
- Bye. - Goodbye.

261
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:52,681
Soo Ji.

262
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,519
Gosh, these are my friends.

263
00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,955
No, he's my senior.

264
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,361
Isn't my daughter really pretty?

265
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,230
I've never seen Ms. Myung so drunk.

266
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,768
Bye, Joon Young.

267
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,370
I mean, Secretary Yoon.

268
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:20,743
Excuse me.

269
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:24,213
Are you here as an employee of JK Group,

270
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,448
or are you here as my mom's friend?

271
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,219
Don't worry.

272
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:44,967
Eun Tae Hee's moving day. Wake up.

273
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,735
I know.

274
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,042
Whatever. She'll manage.

275
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,451
Get your passport. Let's go to Hong Kong.

276
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,721
(What are you talking about?)

277
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,523
(Let's go eat dim sum. It's going to snow today.)

278
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:16,265
Right, Soo Ji eats dim sum whenever it snows.

279
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:22,171
Why did it have to snow today?

280
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,117
I'm so sorry.

281
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,954
I thought you were going to help me move these too.

282
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:43,692
I'm only here to load and unload these.

283
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:46,161
If you want me to carry them, it'll be extra 30 dollars.

284
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,765
Yes, please do that.

285
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:52,201
You should've called your boyfriend.

286
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:53,869
Don't you have one?

287
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,347
Darn it, I hate the cold weather.

288
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,187
Do I have to go over?

289
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,226
You need a hand when you get there, right?

290
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,861
That's extra.

291
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:20,829
- What? - Miss.

292
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,665
You're getting a very good deal because it's me.

293
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:30,239
Hey, Si Hyun.

294
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:32,541
- Give them to me. - Forget it.

295
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,711
- Let me get them. - Forget it.

296
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,080
Give them to me.

297
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:41,950
Leave them. I'll do it.

298
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,288
Why is he annoyed?

299
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:48,590
Did you two fight?

300
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,959
Just let him off this once.

301
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,761
It's not like that.

302
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,111
Catch.

303
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:16,718
Over here.

304
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:24,426
Let's go.

305
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:28,831
Sir.

306
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:30,699
We'll go in my car.

307
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:31,967
What?

308
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,012
What?

309
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,249
I said that I'm moving in today.

310
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:48,517
What do you mean it's a different person?

311
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,152
We have no idea.

312
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,790
Someone already moved into that room.

313
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,291
What?

314
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,227
Give me one second.

315
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,969
(Myoungjeong Dormitory)

316
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,407
Hello. I'm Eun Tae Hee, the scholarship student.

317
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:15,911
I came to move in, but there must've been a mistake.

318
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:24,987
What?

319
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:29,958
I never called you to cancel the room.

320
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:33,462
Who said that? I never called.

321
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,901
Why would I cancel the room?

322
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:42,037
I have nowhere else to go.

323
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,677
Why are you crying so much? You'll figure something out.

324
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:52,180
I don't have a home anymore. How can I not cry?

325
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:54,216
Let's go for now.

326
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,851
Where are we going?

327
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,389
I'm sure this was all a mistake or something.

328
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:04,660
Why won't you listen to me?

329
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,430
Let go of me.

330
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,380
Where are we?

331
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:26,682
Home.

332
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:30,619
You slept like a baby.

333
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:45,200
It's cold, so you should go upstairs. It's probably nothing.

334
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,536
This car belonged to my late mom.

335
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:51,773
The passcode is...

336
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:53,809
your phone number.

337
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,428
What was I expecting?

338
00:23:19,368 --> 00:23:22,004
Are you joking with me?

339
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:24,439
I'm already angry as it is.

340
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,975
Your number is the passcode.

341
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:29,111
Yes, it's not 4112.

342
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:34,983
Are you stupid? You have to punch in the entire number.

343
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,251
What?

344
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:41,456
I'm hanging up.

345
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:58,140
What is this, Si Hyun?

346
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,202
How many times do I have to tell you?

347
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:01,870
That's my mom's car.

348
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,939
How can I be a thief?

349
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,741
We have to investigate...

350
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:07,776
because we received a report.

351
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,011
Who made the report?

352
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,346
Mr. Kwon Seok Woo.

353
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:13,515
Your dad.

354
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:17,419
Your dad must've reported you for not coming home for so long.

355
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:23,458
Under whose name is this car registered?

356
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,428
Si Hyun, you said this was your mom's, right?

357
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:28,497
Yes, you're right.

358
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,635
Whoever's name is listed under the car registration is the owner.

359
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:36,571
If the owner dies, the inheritance is commenced right away.

360
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:39,007
So the inheritor automatically becomes the lawful owner.

361
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:42,711
That means this car is co-owned by my friend's dad and my friend.

362
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,446
Which makes my friend an owner.

363
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:46,448
And since he's been driving it around,

364
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:48,350
the co-owner has made a tacit agreement.

365
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,920
And if he is allowed to use this, you cannot imprison him.

366
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,955
So this isn't a theft, is it?

367
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:58,193
Yes, you're right.

368
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:02,197
Goodness, you should go home and talk it out with your dad.

369
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:04,132
And make sure you report your inheritance.

370
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:06,101
Family members shouldn't be reporting each other.

371
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:08,236
And the car is completely clean without a record of accidents.

372
00:26:08,703 --> 00:26:09,771
What?

373
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:12,274
There's no record of accidents?

374
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:13,708
None.

375
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:15,010
Why?

376
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:16,912
Wait.

377
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,049
My mom died because of an accident...

378
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:22,918
that happened in this car.

379
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:26,988
If the accident caused a death, it probably should've been reported.

380
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:34,763
I am Mr. Kwon's representative.

381
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,498
You can discuss this with me.

382
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,599
(Chief Secretary Yoon Joon Young)

383
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,936
His representative is right here.

384
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,775
I'll take care of the rest.

385
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:06,127
Let's go. You must be hungry.

386
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,581
I thought tofu would be a bit too much.

387
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,989
You've never seen a dad reporting his son, have you?

388
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,291
My family is a mess.

389
00:27:38,693 --> 00:27:40,262
My family isn't that great either.

390
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,331
Have you ever seen a dad...

391
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:46,101
who quit being a law professor because he had a crush on someone?

392
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,304
What's worse is...

393
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:52,207
that he had a one-sided crush on his wife,

394
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:53,942
which is also my mom.

395
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,479
The guy whose heart grew sick...

396
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,448
because he hid his feelings...

397
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:03,018
was your dad.

398
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:04,786
Yes.

399
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:08,657
My mom still thinks that he's working as a professor,

400
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,860
but he's a barista now. Isn't that amazing?

401
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,662
Yes.

402
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:15,964
It was amazing.

403
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:18,667
I heard his girlfriend is a law school student.

404
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:24,606
What's wrong? Are you okay?

405
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:26,441
I'm fine. I just ate too quickly.

406
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:32,147
It's a bit cold.

407
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,849
I thought you said you're naturally hot.

408
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:37,986
Are you feverish?

409
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,689
It's too cold today. You should've stayed home.

410
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:48,430
You came because you were worried about me.

411
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,497
Of course.

412
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,468
How can a guy who smiles like a fool in a police car deal with that?

413
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:55,737
Good point.

414
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:00,442
I saw...

415
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,511
your drawing of me.

416
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:11,319
You just got caught liking me, didn't you?

417
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:12,921
Oh, well...

418
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:16,458
That? Well, that's just...

419
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,994
- That's not just why... - It's okay.

420
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:21,396
You can answer slowly.

421
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,532
I think...

422
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:28,370
I...

423
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,706
like you already.

424
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:47,122
Won't you regret it?

425
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,657
What? Regret what?

426
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,060
1, 2.

427
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,256
Inside me...

428
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,125
a secret started to grow.

429
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:37,672
It's snowing.

430
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,945
Do you know it's good luck to move on a snowy day?

431
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,948
Will something good happen to me?

432
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:54,956
Thank you.

433
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:57,459
I would've been so lost without you.

434
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:00,528
When we arrive, I'll buy jajangmyeon and sweet and sour pork.

435
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:02,230
Okay.

436
00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:22,650
Let me live with someone I love.

437
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,957
I hope that wish comes true.
