Did you not even say you're going to university?

18

What about you?

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,505
Try to be ordinary.

21
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:12,442
Take your mom's money, and visit your dad.

22
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,610
No, thanks.

Yes, I was so surprised.

154

Everyone's business is private, but they shouldn't have gotten caught.

155
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:26,415
This isn't a matter of getting caught or not.

156
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,819

159
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,726
That day, a few of the male students must've gone to a club.

160
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,028
Well, at the club, they...

161
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,364
What was it called?

162
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,034
Did they pick up women?

163
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:48,471
They picked up a mother of a graduate and drank together.

164
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,606
Unbelievable.

165
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:54,543
They kissed and were all over each other in front of the whole group.

166
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:59,281
I heard that they got caught at a hotel, not a club.

167
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:02,485
Apparently, those two were glued to each other the whole night.

168
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,186
They probably went all...

169
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:08,991
But I'm sure the mother didn't know.

170
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,827
You don't know unless you ask how old they are.

171
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,362
You have a point.

172
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:16,766
For example, no one would've guessed that Ms. Jung here...

173
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,802
had a 20-year-old daughter.

174
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,470
In the eyes of the boys,

175
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,206
she was just a pretty lady.

176
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:28,511
- No. - I am all for ladies...

177
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,346

178
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,850
But I believe people must dress according to their age. That's all.

179
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:40,356
But who was the boy that this became the talk of the town?

180
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,024
You didn't know who it was all this time?

181
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,527
He's the grandson of JK Group.

182
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,762

I heard he's really sexy.

185
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,937
Once he holds your gaze, you can't breathe.

186
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:58,707
Do you not know him? He went to the same school with Kyung Joo.

187
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,677
I know him. Of course, I do.

188
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:03,379
I heard that the mother hasn't come to her senses...

189
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,881
and kept calling the student.

190
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:09,351
My gosh, she must've lost her marbles. What does she want?

191
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:12,121
I'm very worried about that mother's child.

192
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,322
Seriously.

193
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,659
Well, if her child is as put together as Kyung Joo,

194
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:18,961
will she be able to handle it?

195
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,873
That story...

196
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,409
was about me.

197
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,480
But how did those witches find out?

198
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:44,653
Joo An, it's me.

199
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:49,458
I just had a question. The guy we met at the club.

200
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,328
Is his name Kwon Si Hyun?

201
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,363
Is it?

202
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,035
I know that you understand Korean.

203
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,606
You heard what my mom and other ladies talked about, right?

204
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,641
What was that about?

205
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,515
What should I wear?

206
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:21,957
When did she upload all these photos?

207
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:24,927
Who is this guy?

208
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,697
He's too handsome.

209
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:33,636
Well, he is handsome.

210
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,005
They are not even following each other?

211
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:40,376
"Si Hyun". His name is Si Hyun.

212
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,613
Is she a celebrity?

213
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:47,917
I think I saw her somewhere.

214
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,187
The ladies didn't leave yet?

215
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:52,488
No.

216
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:53,889
What about the cake?

217
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,126
What is it? Did they upset you again?

218
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,160
No.

219
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:02,798
Tae Hee, I'm sleepy all of a sudden. I'm going to sleep now.

220
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,967
Okay. Sleep tight.

221
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,136
I'll leave later.

222
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:08,604
Since when will you stay here?

223
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:11,574
I should go back when Dad comes back to Korea.

224
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:15,277
If I stay out, it's good for everyone.

225
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:18,247
I can't stay here for long either.

226
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:22,618
- Are you going out? - You're not doing anything,

227
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,987
- so what can I do but go out? - Am I a burden to you?

228
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:27,590
Yes.

229
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,792
If you stay here a bit longer,

230
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,393
I'll lose my mind.

231
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:33,729
Okay. I'll go back.

232
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,698
Forget it. Do you want Soo Ji to beat you up?

233
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:38,000
Stop whining, and get dressed.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,269
Go down, and make an appearance. Don't give her more excuses.

235
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:46,709
(Supporters' Night)

236
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,514
(Seol Young Won, Pottery Exhibition)

237
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:55,351
Tae Hee?

238
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:57,586
You're Tae Hee, right?

239
00:16:58,554 --> 00:16:59,822
Hey, Ki Young.

240
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:03,225
My gosh, how long has it been?

241
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,864
Myoungjeong has become one of the major foundations.

242
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,700
Their events are getting fancier.

243
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:17,973
Could you check again if this is my seat?

244
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:20,509
Yes, ma'am. This is your seat, ma'am.

245
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,777
Okay.

246
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,447
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

247
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:30,085
We will begin the event for Supporters' Night after 10 minutes.

248
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,988
- That table is the VVIP table. - Please wait for the event.

249
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,891
Did you not make a big donation this time?

250
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:40,229
I came here on a tight schedule. I cannot believe this.

251
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,600
Hello, I didn't see you walking in.

252
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,002
I am here, but I must leave now.

253
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,937
What is the problem? Is there something wrong?

254
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,739
A problem? No.

255
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:53,542
You begged me to make a donation,

256
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:56,211
so I was worried that Myoungjeong was struggling again.

257
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,681
Now that I see you're doing okay, I must leave.

258
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:02,084
The problem is that she's sitting at a table like this.

259
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:04,753
Na Yoon, how vulgar.

260
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,789
I only asked to make sure.

261
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:10,726
I'm sorry. There must have been an error with the VIP list.

262
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:15,698
I received the reply from JK group rather late.

263
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:18,701
"JK"? Who from JK group is coming?

264
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,502
The vice president is coming.

265
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:22,338
He said he would join us even if it's late.

266
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:23,839
Really?

267
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,775
There's JK's logo on the banner too.

268
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:27,776
(2018 Myoungjeong Foundation)

269
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:31,080
If there has been an error, fix it. I'll wait.

270
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:35,084
Is JK Group sponsoring the foundation now?

271
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:37,019
Yes, they have made a generous contribution this time.

272
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:40,823
I presume that you know Vice President Kwon Seok Woo well?

273
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:42,791
Is there something going on between you two?

274
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,928
He's single, and so are you.

275
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:51,433
Your table is ready, ma'am. Why don't I escort you?

276
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,340
Are you coming too?

277
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,376
No.

278
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,178
I was looking for some food.

279
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,448
Is there black tea that I usually drink?

280
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,218
- Here's your black tea. - Thank you.

281
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:10,586
Why don't I give you a hand?

282
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:13,288
I apologize.

283
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:16,091
Why is she trying so hard to please people like her?

284
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:17,860
I will make sure this never happens again.

285
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:21,330
- What about college? - I'll be going to your alma mater.

286
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:24,199
Did you take the bar exam?

287
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,804
I went to law school.

288
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,339
It's not Seoul National University though.

289
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:33,242
How is your father? I should go visit him.

290
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,447
He's in Germany. I'm fine on my own.

291
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,051
Look at you, kid. You're all grown up.

292
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:46,488
My gosh, should you pinch a lady's cheek like this?

293
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,626
Since you're a lady now, will you go on a date if I ask?

294
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,529
Are you serious? That was so lame.

295
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,400
Excuse me for a second.

296
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,707
It's you.

297
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:07,976
His first love.

298
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,854
Si Hyun's father will be here, so greet him.

299
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,189
Mom.

300
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,825
What is he doing?

301
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:29,865
Darn it, it looks like he caught me spying on him.

302
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:34,102
The recipients of Myoungjeong's 2018 university scholarships...

303
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:36,505
will receive tuition for the full four years...

304
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:39,241
and stay in a dorm provided by the foundation.

305
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:41,710
They will grow up to better our society.

306
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,279
First, Eun Tae Hee.

307
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,317
(Myoungjeong Foundation Presentation Ceremony)

308
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:49,852
Thank you.

309
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:59,728
Next, Kang Ji Woo.

310
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,699
(Eun Tae Hee)

311
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:12,508
I had no idea Lee Ki Young could smile like that.

312
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:18,580
He used to act like a disaster would happen if he laughed out loud.

313
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:22,184
He's interested in Samyeong Foods.

314
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:26,021
The adults are talking about marrying him to Park Hye Jeong.

315
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:29,725
- So? - I'll teach her that...

316
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:31,093
Ki Young's not for her.

317
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:34,730
- She's only 19. - And you're only 20.

318
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,400
I did some digging.

319
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:42,004
Her family's the backward type that believes women...

320
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:43,739
and bowls crack when left outside.

321
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,841
They didn't send her to school.

322
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,577
She lived a sheltered, home-schooled life.

323
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:50,412
Look, she's not wearing panties.

324
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:54,650
Korean, English, math, music, art, and sports.

325
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,352
They say she's an all-rounded, young lady,

326
00:21:57,352 --> 00:22:00,222
but she's just being tutored 24-7.

327
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:01,857
I heard about her.

328
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,192
My sixth brother is friends with hers.

329
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:10,198
Darn it. My boobs got so big that they get in the way.

330
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,500
Once more.

331
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,369
He's just as annoying as my brother.

332
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,572
That's it. Move a little more.

333
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:17,739
Relax your shoulders.

334
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:19,274
- That's it. - Park Hye Jeong!

335
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:20,509
What, what, what?

336
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,311
Why is your skirt so short?

337
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:24,947
Do you play tennis to show your bottom? Get changed.

338
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:28,050
- How is this short? - You brat.

339
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:32,955
How are you?

340
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:34,990
Hello.

341
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,363
What? You're not an athlete. You're too naughty.

342
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:43,865
Why does a girl need to play sports?

343
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,701
You can talk, Shorty.

344
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:47,903
Why is he always complaining to me?

345
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,004
I'm older than you.

346
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:51,473
That hurt!

347
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:52,975
It was meant to hurt!

348
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,911
How dare you? He's so annoying.

349
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:59,648
Her brother wasn't able to hang out with mine for a while.

350
00:23:00,015 --> 00:23:01,750
I'll show him.

351
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,259
You, Park Hye Jeong...

352
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,163
You can't... I'm in big trouble now.

353
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,432
Hey, Hye Jeong.

354
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:23,238
He couldn't walk for two weeks?

355
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:25,907
I'm starting to imagine it. Enjoy that in private.

356
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,343
- Oh, sorry. - Anyway,

357
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:32,114
I will show her a world she had no idea existed.

358
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:34,683
Quit being sweet, and be honest.

359
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:38,253
You want to damage Lee Ki Young's sweet bride.

360
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:42,124
It's good for her too. What's the point in being naive?

361
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:44,326
I agree. It's not the Joseon era.

362
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,261
We don't honor loyal women anymore.

363
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:50,298
There's one more target.

364
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,936
Myoungjeong's scholarship recipient Eun Tae Hee.

365
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,906
She got full marks in the SAT, came top of her year,

366
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:01,176
and aced math, science, English, etc.

367
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:04,279
Anyway, if Lee Ki Young's mind wants Park Hye Jeong,

368
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,815
it seems like his heart wants Eun Tae Hee.

369
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:11,219
They say men never forget their first love until they die.

370
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,488
He had that look on his face.

371
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:16,158
You're shooting laser beams.

372
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,659
Anyway,

373
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,961
I'm working on her. Are you all in?

374
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:22,264
I'm in. It sounds like fun.

375
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:23,331
You?

376
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,167
- Not interested. - Why not?

377
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,569
Why go that far? It's such a nuisance.

378
00:24:28,804 --> 00:24:30,439
"Why go that far?"

379
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,908
Why must I be miserable alone?

380
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,410
You said you'd help make Lee Ki Young pay.

381
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,913
I want him to taste rejection.

382
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:41,116
I can't stand to watch him get what he wants so easily.

383
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:45,120
He focuses all his fury on his old man.

384
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,888
- Be quiet. - Kwon Si Hyun.

385
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,461
Guys, guys.

386
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:55,831
I'll do it. What shall I do?

387
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:59,701
Shall I flirt with Hye Jeong? Or the smart girl as well?

388
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:01,203
I don't mind.

389
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:03,872
You're a famous player.

390
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:05,507
Would her mom not know you?

391
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,676
Go away, kid.

392
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:13,482
(Secretary Yoon)

393
00:25:13,482 --> 00:25:15,016
The vice chairman will arrive soon.

394
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:17,119
He won't stay long. Come over.

395
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:22,491
Sorry, I'm out.

396
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:23,792
Si Hyun.

397
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:29,030
Are you hiding something from us?

398
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,471
Were you...

399
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:38,740
kicked out of home?

400
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:46,581
- He heard about Kyung Joo's mom? - No.

401
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:49,551
It's true. Tell me. How far did you go?

402
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:52,154
He said it's not that.

403
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:53,855
I'll do it. I can like anyone.

404
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:57,125
I said it can't be you. Get off me.

405
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:02,264
Isn't he strange?

406
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:05,734
Leave him. He'll tell when he's ready.

407
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:22,150
Yes.

408
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,591
Where are you going?

409
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,561
He wanted to come here.

410
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:36,698
Sorry.

411
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:40,735
Why did you...

412
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,637
ignore my calls?

413
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:46,441
I called because I was anxious.

414
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,077
Were you afraid I'd talk?

415
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:50,412
You didn't...

416
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:53,982
tell Kyung Joo, did you?

417
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:57,686
If she were to find out about us...

418
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:00,255
"I'll date you too, to apologize."

419
00:27:01,223 --> 00:27:02,390
I'll say that.

420
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:12,167
I'm sorry, but will you do that for me?

421
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,402
Kyung Joo...

422
00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:16,705
hates me a lot.

423
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:19,808
She'll want to leave home if she finds out.

424
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:23,011
I don't dare make an excuse and...

425
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,016
I'm not her real mom.

426
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,219
She doesn't know.

427
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:34,856
I can't live without her.

428
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,525
Why...

429
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,895
Darn it.

430
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,732
I can't tell if we aren't friends.

431
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:50,038
I won't tell.

432
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:53,608
Thanks.

433
00:27:58,546 --> 00:27:59,748
I sometimes...

434
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,851
want to see you.

435
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:04,819
Isn't that funny?

436
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:09,057
- Take care. Bye. - See you.

437
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:11,493
Ms. Jung?

438
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,907
Marriage?

439
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:31,546
We met over work and...

440
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:36,451
I didn't mean to announce it this way.

441
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,323
Ms. Myung's vision for the future is quite like mine.

442
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:46,027
Since we made it public, let's call this our engagement.

443
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:46,921
(Tempted)

444
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:49,891
Fortunately, you're not yet calling me Kwon Soo Ji.

445
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,794
Everyone I like leaves me.

446
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:54,129
She's living in torture.

447
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:55,897
If you have a brain, shut it.

448
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:57,132
Marriage?

449
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:58,666
I'll give you one last chance.

450
00:29:58,666 --> 00:29:59,968
I'm against it.

451
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:02,070
Is it Si Hyun? Do you like him?

452
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,305
Kwon Si Hyun, do you still like me?

453
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,041
Can you kiss me?

454
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,042
Eun Tae Hee.

455
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,309
Do you know each other?

456
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,344
- Yes. - No.

457
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:12,847
- No. - How can I dislike you?
