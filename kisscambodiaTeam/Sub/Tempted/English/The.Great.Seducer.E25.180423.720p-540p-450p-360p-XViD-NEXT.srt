1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,714
Si Hyun.

2
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,384
All I do is...

3
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:16,886
make you sad.

4
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,424
You came to me...

5
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:24,728
and brought me the biggest happiness.

6
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:27,731
But I...

7
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:31,034
made you cry in the end.

8
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:32,736
Thank you for everything.

9
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,674
In the end,

10
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:40,944
I'm the one who'll make you cry the most.

11
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,423
That's why I couldn't stop you.

12
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:57,560
Instead, I decided to wait for you.

13
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,124
(Episode 25)

14
00:01:58,088 --> 00:01:59,356
I'll wait.

15
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,429
I must be going crazy.

16
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,498
Why am I hearing his voice?

17
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,046
I must be going crazy too.

18
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,785
Why am I hearing your voice?

19
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,589
I keep hearing it.

20
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,437
I miss you,

21
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,072
Tae Hee.

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,449
You couldn't sleep again?

23
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,586
No.

24
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,523
Goodness.

25
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,426
My dear Tae Hee.

26
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,930
Get up. Let's go to school.

27
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:50,633
I do like going to school every day with you.

28
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,403
I hope Si Hyun...

29
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,172
isn't waiting again today.

30
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,341
He came yesterday too.

31
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,443
It's been days.

32
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:02,245
That's why...

33
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,514
I said I'd stay at the workroom.

34
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:07,350
I guess he wants to get a glimpse of you.

35
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,753
He'll have to deal with his own feelings.

36
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,124
I know you miss him too.

37
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,099
Give me the car key.

38
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,001
I never said you could use that.

39
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,769
I need to practice with a used car.

40
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:30,206
You still can't use that car.

41
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:33,643
Se Joo already took it to a shop to get it checked.

42
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,912
Are you worried because it got into an accident before?

43
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:40,583
- What? - They said a part was changed.

44
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,918
Did you get into an accident?

45
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,053
Leave the key. I'm going to total it.

46
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,622
Mom.

47
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,325
Is Si Hyun's grandma giving you a hard time?

48
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,294
What do you mean?

49
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:53,162
Is everything okay with Mr. Kwon now?

50
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,366
We're fine.

51
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,536
Why do you ask?

52
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:01,638
Just because.

53
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:04,941
I hope you marry him without any problems.

54
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,143
If you need help, I'll help you.

55
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:11,948
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,017
Is it weird that I'm taking your side?

57
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,833
Why do you keep pretending to be a bad guy?

58
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,369
It only hurts you.

59
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,771
Why do you never hold my hand first?

60
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,974
Why do you make me wonder...

61
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,476
if our first kiss happened in a dream?

62
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,878
Why do you make me ask these questions?

63
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,984
Can we just stay like this for a bit?

64
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:23,786
Just for a little.

65
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,857
You have such a great smile.

66
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:31,427
But I always made you cry.

67
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,235
I'm sorry, Tae Hee.

68
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,789
She called me many times.

69
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:36,526
I'll call you later. Keep your phone turned on.

70
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,334
What's going on? Why is your phone turned off?

71
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,103
I'm busy because of a contest.

72
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,504
Why?

73
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,173
What do you mean?

74
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:53,376
Because you seemed fine, then you completely got out of touch.

75
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:55,712
It's not like we stayed in touch that often.

76
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,648
Tae Hee.

77
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,718
You seem so different from the last time I saw you.

78
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:03,953
You're making me worried.

79
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,221
What's going on?

80
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:07,323
Are you upset at me?

81
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,624
Upset?

82
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,327
Why?

83
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,695
Did you do something?

84
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:14,831
What?

85
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,866
Do you remember our last conversation?

86
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,368
You said you were returning to your workroom...

87
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:22,438
and that you weren't dating anyone.

88
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,142
So what happened? Did you start dating someone?

89
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:28,144
You can be honest.

90
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,646
Nothing you do surprises me anymore.

91
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:33,916
- Tae Hee... - I turned my phone off on purpose.

92
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:37,120
Because I didn't want to hear from you, not anyone else.

93
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,890
I blocked your number, so don't call Kyung Joo either.

94
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,358
So why did you...

95
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:46,262
come and mess with me when I was just fine?

96
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:50,066
Tae Hee.

97
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:54,303
It's okay. You can shout at me and be angry at me.

98
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:55,972
But you seem really odd.

99
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,940
What's going on?

100
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,810
Whom do you think makes my life hard?

101
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:04,080
You were the one who always gave me a tough time.

102
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:05,581
Both my dad and I...

103
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,785
wouldn't have suffered if it wasn't for you.

104
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:12,622
Yes. This is all because of you too.

105
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:13,990
Do you want to know?

106
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,660
The guy whom you couldn't get over...

107
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,862
and whom Dad and I had to suffer because of...

108
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:23,166
is my boyfriend's dad.

109
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,070
Do you know how sorry I was toward Si Hyun?

110
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,606
Wasn't it enough that you ruined...

111
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:33,743
Dad and my life? How many more should suffer because of you?

112
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,145
Thanks to you, it's all over.

113
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,349
Please get out of my life.

114
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:55,965
I'm never seeing her again.

115
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,100
Never.

116
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:03,206
(Hye Jeong)

117
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,378
(Hye Jeong)

118
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,781
Hey, Hye Jeong.

119
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,649
Are you on your way?

120
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:16,118
I'm all prepared for class.

121
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:17,920
Okay. I'll be there soon.

122
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:20,489
Goodness, my future son-in-law.

123
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:23,359
Why did you get hurt?

124
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,162
I had a bit of a rough workout.

125
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:28,965
My goodness. You should've been careful.

126
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,666
Oh, no.

127
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,001
I'm fine.

128
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,107
She's here.

129
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,717
- Hello. - Welcome.

130
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:51,554
- Ki Young? - Tae Hee.

131
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:53,289
Oh, dear.

132
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:56,859
Do you know Hye Jeong's math tutor?

133
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:58,361
Oh, yes.

134
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,163
She's my mentor's daughter.

135
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:02,899
I see.

136
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,468
I knew you were from an elite family.

137
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:10,139
Then I don't have to introduce my future son-in-law.

138
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,974
Future son-in-law...

139
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:14,710
You look better than I thought.

140
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,280
In the video, you totally flew away.

141
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,048
- Video? - Yes.

142
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,183
The guy who fainted in Cheongdam-dong.

143
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,552
It's you, right? Mr. L from a Seoul law firm.

144
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,254
Should we watch it together?

145
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:26,422
- Should I turn it on? - Yes.

146
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,556
Stop it, Hye Jeong.

147
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,925
Stop, Kyu Jeong.

148
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,561
Why would you watch that? That's low class.

149
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,463
What do you mean?

150
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:37,833
You're the one who was being annoying and got beaten up.

151
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:40,136
It was so satisfying to watch, Tae Hee.

152
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:41,871
I wasn't being annoying.

153
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,773
I'm a very righteous person.

154
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:46,742
I'm right.

155
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:49,245
You started the argument, and it turned into a messy fight.

156
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,147
Mother, what did I tell you?

157
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:53,049
She started hanging around with Soo Ji...

158
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,217
and got influenced. She talks like her too.

159
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:57,386
Stop using your phone.

160
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,121
Goodness.

161
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,227
Hye Jeong.

162
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,196
Are you...

163
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,931
getting married?

164
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,901
No, I have a boyfriend.

165
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,270
The adults are being foolish.

166
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:17,306
I'm relieved.

167
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:20,042
I don't recommend him as a boyfriend.

168
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,178
Have you heard of this phrase?

169
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,847
"Only lovers will survive."

170
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:28,584
I'm going to get into college and marry Joo An.

171
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,720
Okay, that sounds awesome.

172
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,756
Is Si Hyun doing well?

173
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,124
Sorry?

174
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,427
You know Si Hyun too?

175
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:46,135
I think he really likes you.

176
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,137
He brought you meat on the opening ceremony.

177
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,241
He did.

178
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,844
- Let's get started. - Okay.

179
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:05,354
- What is it? - Just one question.

180
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,157
Is Si Hyun still following you around?

181
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,658
Do you want me to take care of him?

182
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,060
Aren't you busy?

183
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:12,895
Take care of what?

184
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,964
I'm doing this for you.

185
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:17,033
Those kids are really scary.

186
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,901
Hye Jeong used to be gentle,

187
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:21,937
but she turned weird after hanging around with Soo Ji.

188
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,640
This happened because of Si Hyun too.

189
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:26,475
Se Joo and Si Hyun were fighting...

190
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,445
over Soo Ji. They beat each other up.

191
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:31,747
This happened while I was trying to stop them.

192
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,884
That has nothing to do with me. I don't want to know either.

193
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:37,820
If you're still associated with them, make sure you cut them off.

194
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,288
You might get hurt.

195
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:42,058
I'm going to sue Si Hyun for this.

196
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:44,560
I don't care if you do or not.

197
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,896
It's up to you. See you.

198
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:50,733
Tae Hee.

199
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,635
Tae Hee?

200
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:56,072
Why is she being like that to me too?

201
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:59,075
I told you to leave, punk.

202
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:03,245
You know how to do everything but fight,

203
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,748
and you only know how to fight.

204
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:08,851
How dare you disgrace your family...

205
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:10,553
and get involved in a group fight?

206
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,221
Let me see you fight.

207
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:15,624
Fight until one of you die.

208
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:20,496
Shall we?

209
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,865
Father.

210
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:26,435
I'll try to persuade Ki Young...

211
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:27,970
and stop the lawsuit.

212
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:30,639
You have to know your place. You can't shame the family name.

213
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:34,343
You fight with your own brother, sue, and accuse each other?

214
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,578
Goodness.

215
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,315
Hey.

216
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,118
Yes, Father.

217
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,553
Please ask your father for a favor.

218
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:48,257
His law firm is more powerful, right?

219
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,761
Of course, Father. I'll take care of it completely.

220
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,730
Close your restaurant too.

221
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,366
If that's the best you can do, just close it.

222
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,535
My restaurant is finally getting business, so why?

223
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,971
You have to pay for the damages.

224
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,739
I'll earn money and pay it off.

225
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:04,874
Or...

226
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:08,144
you're wasting your time and doing no good in that house.

227
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:09,545
Get out of there.

228
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:13,349
Mom gave me that place.

229
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,317
Nobody can touch it.

230
00:15:17,052 --> 00:15:18,888
Even if you don't get sued,

231
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:22,158
that's what you pay for disgracing the family.

232
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:25,561
Okay. I'll take care of that, Father.

233
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,631
No, I'll take care of whatever I have to.

234
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:31,967
If you ask me to leave this house, I'd rather do that.

235
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,637
If you touch that place,

236
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,507
I won't just sit and watch.

237
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,413
Why do you look so worried?

238
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:48,918
Seowon was planning to sue you for the fist fight,

239
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,920
so I took care of it.

240
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,288
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:56,358
Why are you in this mess? What's wrong?

242
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,561
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

243
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:01,163
Once your father comes back from his vacation,

244
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:04,366
come with me.

245
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:07,503
Ask Yeo Min for help.

246
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,171
You can start studying again.

247
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,408
Rather than getting scolded by your father all the time,

248
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:13,742
this is better.

249
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:17,446
Grandma.

250
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,215
Yes.

251
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,351
I know you speak highly of me...

252
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:25,287
and trust me even though I'm not good at anything.

253
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,623
I know you have high hopes for me too.

254
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,292
So I always felt bad.

255
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,831
There's something you need to know before it's too late.

256
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:42,905
I...

257
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,746
am not Father's biological son.

258
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:55,484
I only found out after I graduated. He told me himself.

259
00:16:55,985 --> 00:17:00,189
He probably didn't tell you because he didn't know how to.

260
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,959
I'm sorry, but I'm in a bad place,

261
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:09,565
so this is the best way I can put it.

262
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,869
I'll follow whatever you say.

263
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,339
Si Hyun.

264
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:20,542
Before I tell you what to do,

265
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:22,177
don't say a word...

266
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:24,146
to anybody.

267
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:26,415
Do you understand?

268
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:27,983
Yes.

269
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:29,585
Good, you can leave.

270
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,367
- Sir. - Yes?

271
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,304
Did Father take time off because he was ill?

272
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,606
Is he at Myoungjeong Hospital?

273
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:54,276
He's getting several tests done. He should be okay.

274
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,645
Okay.

275
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,521
Hello, Dr. Kim.

276
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:09,191
I have a favor to ask in secret.

277
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,461
Like you see in the scans,

278
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:16,165
surgery is the only option for a good prognosis.

279
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,667
Okay.

280
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:22,504
President Myung, are you all right?

281

(Medical data)

282
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,479
It won't be easy, but it's not impossible to treat.

283
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,715
If the surgery goes well, you have a good chance.

284
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:11,286
Let's call off our wedding first.

285
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:13,756
I shouldn't put the burden on you.

286
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,159
We can talk about work-related things later.

287
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,927
Nothing has changed.

288
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:22,030
I'm going to fulfill my role in my position.

289
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,100
If you feel sorry for me in the slightest way,

290
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:27,736
you should focus on your treatment.

291
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:29,605
Get changed into the hospital gown.

292
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,841
There are many tests they have to run, so you should rest a bit.

297
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,757
Hi, this is Tae Hee. I'm a student.

298
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,593
Yes, I'm calling again.

299
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,229
Did anybody drop out this month?

300
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:30,432
There's a student who dropped out due to military duties,

301
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,267
and there's a female student too.

302
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:34,770
You can move in next month. Would that work for you?

303
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,905
Of course. I need a place to stay.

304
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,608
I'll use the application you filled out before.

305
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,878
The earliest you can move in is two weeks later.

306
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:44,746
When do you want to move in?

307
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:50,752
I will fill out the application and pick the date in person.

308
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:53,922
I think there had been a mix-up when I set it up through the phone.

309
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,559
Okay. I'll get there before the closing hour.

310
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,294
Thank you.

311
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,706
Did you have lunch?

312
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,108
No, I didn't. I thought I was going to die.

313
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:14,209
Open your mouth.

314

What are you...

00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,444
I took a nap?

317
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,381
How many years has it been?

318
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:16,371
- Did you visit your father? - Yes.

319
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:17,639
Why didn't you stay longer?

320
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,741
He was resting.

321
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,045
Is it serious?

322
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,547
It's treatable. Don't worry.

Sure.

329

We definitely got a call that you wanted to withdraw from the dorm.

330
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,837
It really wasn't me.

331
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:51,473
Anyway, we're sorry about that.

What brings you to the hospital? Are you not well?

335
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:16,465
No, I needed to take care of something with the foundation.

00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,138
- What about you? - My dad's hospitalized.

Why did you visit the scholarship foundation office?

342
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,389
It's about the dormitory.

343

00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,806
Can I ask you that if you don't mind?

369
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:40,442
I found out that my mom's car had never been in an accident.

370
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,744
I asked a detective.

371
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:45,480
He told me that there had been...

372
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,916
only one hit-and-run case in Jeongeup that day.

373
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:50,552
I asked President Myung just in case.

374
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:54,189
I just thought that you might know something about it.

375
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,091
Why didn't you suspect that...

376
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,728
your mom could've been the hit-and-run driver?

377
00:26:01,596 --> 00:26:03,131
- All we can do is... - "Hope that..."

378
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:07,335
"the student is doing well." That's what she said.

379
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,209
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:16,845
I made you think about that day again.

381
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:18,446
No.

382
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,315
It's all in the past now.

383
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:22,150
I'm fine.

384
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:29,524
Take good care of your father.

385
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,359
It must be hard on you.

386
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,029
Goodbye.

387
00:26:59,554 --> 00:27:03,058
"All we can do is hope that the student is doing well."

388
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,993
That's what she said.

389
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:07,529
She doesn't have access to the victim's personal information.

390
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:11,666
Does that mean President Myung...

391
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,569
was at the scene of the accident?

392
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,647
Aunt Geum Sil.

393
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:27,482
Could I...

394
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,186
ask you a few questions about my car accident?

395
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:32,520
That was random.

396
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,757
What is it? Are you not feeling well these days?

397
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:37,359
Are you having nightmares?

398
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,527
No, it's not that.

399
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:42,330
When I woke up after the accident,

400
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,032
did I say anything?

401
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,301
Or do you know any evidence we found that day?

402
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,404
Let's see. At that time, you asked...

403
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:52,707
if the lady was okay and if she was transferred to a hospital.

404
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:54,309
You did ask some weird questions.

405
00:27:54,776 --> 00:27:57,445
That's why your mother thought that you didn't recognize her.

406
00:27:57,445 --> 00:28:00,448
She was heartbroken because you thought she was some strange lady.

407
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,952
I remember now. I did say that.

408
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,220
Tae Hee.

409
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,490
Don't try to think about the accident.

410
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,859
When it pops up in your head, just push it away, okay?

411
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:14,296
When trauma victims of car accidents think about the accidents,

412
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:16,665
they can remember the color of the car after a few years.

413
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:18,466
It happens to some people,

414
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,236
but remembering it would be hard on you.

415
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:22,771
Just forget about it.

416
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:24,639
Okay.

417
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,415
It's all right.

418
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,483
Give Tae Hee some time.

419
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,386
Work on your relationship with her little by little.

420
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,155
If I can,

421
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,826
I want to go back 20 years of my life.

422
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,169
How could we go back in time?

423
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:56,972
It's hard to cope with that.
