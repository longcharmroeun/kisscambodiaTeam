1
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,738
Noodles are noodles.

2
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,840
Eggs are just eggs.

3
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,156
Kyung Joo, I just cooked some noodles, and it's insane.

4
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,025
Come over, I'll make you some.

5
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,560
How can you even eat?

6
00:00:58,228 --> 00:00:59,529
You animal.

7
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:02,932
Animal?

8
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,068
Animal...

9
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,973
What are you doing? You animal.

10
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:13,810
What will you do if we miss the last train?

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,578
You animal.

12
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,681
Animal.

13
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:23,586
Hey, if you call me an animal once more,

14
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,155
I will kill you.

15
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:30,327
You're losing your mind as well.

16
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,902
I don't feel full at all.

17
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,543
Why am I so angry?

18
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,883
He said he's not angry.

19
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,519
Why does he suddenly dislike me?

20
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:59,656
Why did he hug me and make me breakfast?

21
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:01,458
Darn it.

22
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,259
If he dislikes me, fine.

23
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,428
Why did he end it like this?

24
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:16,039
Kwon Si Hyun, you scumbag!

25
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,709
You went overboard, Tae Hee.

26
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,946
You said you wouldn't die because of a breakup.

27
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,857
Bring your assignment to the office,

28
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:16,159
and don't forget to get a receipt.

29
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,760
- Okay. - Okay.

30
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,429
Another thing.

31
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:20,897
Let's not miss...

32
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:22,732
post-project parties or gatherings.

33
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:25,034
We have to hang out in the office from now on.

34
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,603
Let's all try to get along.

35
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,540
Tae Hee, sign the register.

36
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:35,745
You'll come to the dinner later, won't you?

37
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:38,481
Sure, I'll be there.

38
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:43,520
(Process Validation Report for Myoungjeong Atopy Stem Cell Drug)

39
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,529
- What is it? - The new drug.

40
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:55,431
The results are bad, and they might pull the plug.

41
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,033
Are you okay?

42
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,735
The rumors are false. We won't stop.

43
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:01,404
I'll apply for a change in testing.

44
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:04,941
If it's approved, we can release the drug sooner.

45
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,743
It won't be easy.

46
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:10,113
If it's about the chairwoman...

47
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:13,149
No. I can get the approval moved up.

48
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:18,021
I hope JK doesn't hear any of this.

49
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:21,190
Okay.

50
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:45,515
I want you...

51
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,518
to live more freely.

52
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,265
- Give me that. - Don't take it. It's a warning.

53
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,070
I'm a doctor.

54
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,706
I prescribe what I need.

55
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,608
I have something to tell you. Spare me some time.

56
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,121
Let's sit.

57
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:06,496
Marriage?

58
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,065
I'm sure I misheard you.

59
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,301
No. You heard me correctly.

60
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,538
I want to marry Si Hyun.

61
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,708
Can you say it in a way that's more understandable?

62
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:23,246
As you know, we've known each other longer that you knew my mom.

63
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,982
And we aren't that naive.

64
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,418
You called me to say that?

65
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:33,723
Did you think saying that would shock us into changing our minds?

66
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:37,427
If this is a joke, stop it right now.

67
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:40,897
The look of shock on your face...

68
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:42,732
makes me think I did something wrong.

69
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,802
You shouldn't be...

70
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:49,038
more shocked than I was when I saw you with another woman.

71
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:52,275
You don't seem to believe me. Shall I go on?

72
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,477
Potter Seol Young Won.

73
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,048
That's enough.

74
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,650
It was a coincidence.

75
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,153
Don't blame me. Blame your carelessness.

76
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:07,256
It's not a bad deal. You have nothing to lose.

77
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,759
What do you mean?

78
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,728
Whoever gets married,

79
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:15,364
you'll get what you need to run your business.

80
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:18,501
You'll get to continue seeing the woman you love,

81
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,772
and I get to stop watching JK use my mom.

82
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,107
Aren't I right?

83
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,842
Based on what you said,

84
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,777
I can't really tell.

85
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,347
I'll talk to Si Hyun.

86
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,616
Go ahead.

87
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,953
Do you remember Lawyer Do Ji Young...

88
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:38,821
who helped JK a few months ago?

89
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:42,658
You already knew we did that.

90
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,228
You just ignored it because it was too troublesome.

91
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:49,265
Yes, we're like that.

92
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,868
We're mean. We act without thinking,

93
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,904
and we don't care if anyone suffers because of us.

94
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,340
You won't be able to stop us.

95
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:01,377
Get us officially engaged.

96
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,213
Then I'll convince Si Hyun and go study abroad together.

97
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:09,819
Why are you asking me and not your mom?

98
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:13,723
Because there's no use.

99
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,893
People who are in love...

100
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:19,328
can't listen to what others say.

101
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,668
My mom hasn't been able to sleep.

102
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,504
She was like that, but her condition has worsened.

103
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,941
It seems like she slept well on some days,

104
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,110
but on other days, she stays up the night.

105
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,546
She can barely wake up because she takes sleeping pills.

106
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,182
Who do you think caused that?

107
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,462
- Hello, Chairwoman Ha. - Hello.

108
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,598
Hello, I'm Choi Go Ya.

109
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,066
Hello.

110
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:59,202
- It's Tae Hee. Hey! - Hello, Tae Hee.

111
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:01,370
- Gosh, Tae Hee. - It's been so long.

112
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,107
I brought steamed buns.

113
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:07,643
- My gosh. - Steamed buns.

114
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:08,744
It's hot.

115
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:11,280
Thanks, Tae Hee. They look delicious.

116
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,915
- My gosh. - It's hot.

117
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,051
Thanks, Tae Hee.

118
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,986
Where did you get the money?

119
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,154
Come and sit.

120
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,922
Enjoy.

121
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:22,725
You have to be careful. That's all sugar.

122
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,127
It's okay. I'll only have a little.

123
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,263
- Gosh. - Where did you get this?

124
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,699
These are genuine, old-style steamed buns.

125
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:33,102
I was at Yangpyeong to do a project.

126
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,571
That means you went with Si Hyun, right?

127
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:38,107
I did.

128
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,609
Why didn't you come with him?

129
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:40,676
Goodness.

130
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,512
- He's busy. - He isn't even going to school.

131
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,815
- Why is he busy? - Hey.

132
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:52,021
Goodness. You both come here whenever you two get in a fight.

133
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:19,782
If you're finished, go get your own water.

134
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,053
My baby, eat slowly.

135
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:27,924
Good girl.

136
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,918
Now, now. Don't cry.

137
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,600
- Go, now. - I'll be leaving.

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,070
- Okay. Bye. - Bye.

139
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,539
- Goodbye. - Come visit again.

140
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,308
Let's go.

141
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,344
Poor girl.

142
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:24,280
I knew he would make her pay for his cuteness.

143
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,549
I will go get him.

144
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:30,519
After a storm comes a calm.

145
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,021
Give them some time.

146
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:36,058
What's she saying to her? She isn't even in her right mind.

147
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,095
Okay.

148
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:41,564
Goodbye.

149
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:43,299
Go home safely.

150
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,001
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

151
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:55,077
Hello, busy President Myung. To what do I owe this honor?

152
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,345
Ms. Jo.

153
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:01,650
I wanted to discuss your son's matter again.

154
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,520
Goodness, President Myung.

155
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,591
I felt really bad after leaving you like that on that day.

156
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:12,728
I have a favor to ask too.

157
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:15,865
I remember seeing you with Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol...

158
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:17,800
on our Supporters' Night.

159
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,404
Could you...

160
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,273
set up a meeting for me?

161
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,110
Oh, he's my cousin-in-law.

162
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,714
Okay. I'll ask him and call you back.

163
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:38,554
- We are the best! - We are the best!

164
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,489
- All right. - Cheers.

165
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:41,524
Welcome...

166
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:44,427
(Ilpoom Pork Skin)

167
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:46,962
- Hey. - Oh, hey.

168
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,998
There's Tae Hee.

169
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:51,400
- Hey, Tae Hee. - Tae Hee's here.

170
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,269
Tae Hee, sit here.

171
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,404
She's not going to sit next to you.

172
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:57,506
- Why? Come on. - In your dreams.

173
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:58,641
Why aren't you drinking?

174
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,109
- Cheers. - Cheers.

175
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,611
Let's play a drinking game, and the game starts now

176
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,847
Baskin Robbins 31

177
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:07,383
Be cute and fresh

178
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:08,417
Two.

179
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,219
- Come on. - Gosh.

180
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:12,288
- My gosh. - Eun Hye, Eun Hye.

181
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:15,324
- My gosh. - You have to drink.

182
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:18,461
Drink, drink, until you die

183
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,097
- Come on. - He ruined it.

184
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:22,898
What's with the vibe?

185
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,868
- We didn't order those. - It's on the house.

186
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:31,974
Thanks.

187
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,610
Drink up.

188
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,712
You did really well on the assignment.

189
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:38,714
Let's enter the contest together.

190
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,017
- I'll think about it. - Okay.

191
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,018
Cheers.

192
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:49,125
Hey, I have this theme, and it's really amazing.

193
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,061
I said I'll think about it.

194
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,497
Forget it. Don't ever ask again.

195
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:56,465
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,167
Take a seat.

197
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:01,103
Hey, why aren't you drinking?

198
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:02,705
Come on, drink up.

199
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:06,709
Guys, let's make a toast.

200
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,819
You're here quite often.

201
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,859
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,564
What do you mean? You want me to be the CEO of JK Bio?

203
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:30,366
Like I said,

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,701
I want you to take the position...

205
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,172
regardless of our marriage.

206
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:40,709
Do you not think I can release the new drug?

207
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:43,179
I don't want you to strain yourself.

208
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,680
When did you ever care...

209
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,683
about my overworking myself?

210
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,321
If you want to call off our wedding, tell me.

211
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:53,355
No.

212
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,225
I'm not sure if you'd believe me,

213
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:59,895
but I was going to leave JK Bio to you even if we got married.

214
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:02,965
You don't believe me.

215
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,569
I always believed you.

216
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:10,339
We have to merge...

217
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,275
and eliminate JK Bio's deficit.

218
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,679
That's the only way I can inherit.

219
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:18,547
But...

220
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:22,251
I don't want to do this anymore.

221
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:25,754
I thought it would be best to leave this business...

222
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,325
to a family member, to someone whom I can trust.

223
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:32,561
I really mean it.

224
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:37,199
I'll consider this offer as something I've never heard.

225
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,568
I met Soo Ji.

226
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,172
We were wrong about...

227
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:46,408
Soo Ji and Si Hyun's relationship.

228
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,616
They want to get married.

229
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:59,088
I thought for a long time about how I could bring this up.

230
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,258
But this is the best I can do.

231
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:06,528
We said we'd discuss our children's matter together,

232
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,298
but I never thought it'd be about this.

233
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:18,240
I... I doubt it.

234
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,344
I need to talk to Soo Ji.

235
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,055
Please don't misunderstand.

236
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:36,458
At first, I needed you and Myoungjeong.

237
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,796
But then, I found out that you were trustworthy.

238
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,799
I know that you are very considerate of me,

239
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,801
and I know that...

240
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:49,605
you don't consider our marriage as a part of your business.

241
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm thankful for all that.

242
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,978
But?

243
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,247
But if this is the case with our children,

244
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:03,085
I don't think we should make a move.

245
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,653
Are you sure...

246
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,156
there are no other reasons?

247
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,297
I'm going to keep doing...

248
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:17,900
what I've been doing...

249
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,469
regardless of our children.

250
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:23,639
Come on, drink up.

251
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,574
- This is great. - Okay.

252
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:26,775
- Drink. - Let's drink.

253
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,711
- Cheers. - Cheers.

254
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:29,912
Cheers.

255
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,780
Kwon Si Hyun.

256
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,016
- What is she saying? - Let's drink.

257
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,251
Cheers, Si Hyun.

258
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:38,220
- Kwon Si Hyun? - Who's that?

259
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,022
- Who's Kwon Si Hyun? - I don't know.

260
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:43,992
Hey, Kwon Si Hyun, let's have a shot.

261
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,563
- I'm not Kwon Si Hyun. - Who's that?

262
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:50,099
- Slow down. - Don't drink too much.

263
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,168
Is she okay?

264
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,205
Si Hyun, have some food.

265
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,906
- Here. - She's drunk.

266
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,308
- She's drunk. - Totally.

267
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,410
- Come on, Si Hyun. - She lost it.

268
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:05,547
Hey. She locked her phone. What now?

269
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:10,119
Hey, hey, you've had enough.

270
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,556
- She's a mess. - What should we do?

271
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:19,795
Hello, I'm Kwon Si Hyun. We met by the mural I painted.

272
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:23,065
I found your mail address on your leaflet.

273
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:24,967
I'd like to meet you.

274
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,503
Could you spare me some time?

275
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,878
(To Seol Young Won)

276
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,217
(Sent successfully)

277
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,973
(Se Joo)

278
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:09,745
What?

279
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,347
Hey. I think you should come over here.

280
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:21,156
What do you want me to do?

281
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:23,692
You're the only person I can call.

282
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,461
Shall I leave her?

283
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:39,107
Si Hyun, have another drink.

284
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,343
What's wrong with you?

285
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,046
Who is Kwon Si Hyun? What's his major?

286
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,113
Kwon Si Hyun?

287
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,316
Kwon Si Hyun...

288
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,785
majors in me, you guys.

289
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,222
He's my type. He's mine.

290
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,925
Oh, my. Si Hyun.

291
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,027
Why aren't you drinking?

292
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:01,363
I'm fine, thanks. I had enough.

293
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:03,265
Food?

294
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:04,566
I'll get you some.

295
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:08,437
- I'll make a wrap. - No, you don't have to.

296
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:11,106
- I'm fine, Tae Hee. - You don't want to eat?

297
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,208
Where's my glass?

298
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,310
- Stop drinking. - Don't give her any.

299
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:17,079
- Kwon Si Hyun. - Tae Hee.

300
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,647
What's wrong with you?

301
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,282
Stop it.

302
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:21,483
Why?

303
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:26,455
- That's enough. - Come on.

304
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:27,523
Not again.

305
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,291
Drink up.

306
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:31,260
Mr. Kwon Si Hyun.

307
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,794
Will you have a drink with me?

308
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:35,697
- Stop it. - Stop it.

309
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,970
It's nice to meet you.

310
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:44,273
- What? - My name is...

311
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,441
Si Hyun.

312
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,544
Yoon Jin.

313
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,146
Call me Si Hyun.

314
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,915
Get a grip.

315
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:57,452
Hey. Will you please call me Si Hyun?

316
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:58,887
You had enough to drink.

317
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:03,158
Will you just call me Si Hyun?

318
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:05,127
Why should they call you Kwon Si Hyun?

319
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:07,462
Why?

320
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:11,967
Because I want to keep hearing that name.

321
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:19,007
Let's go home, Tae Hee.

322
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:20,842
Kwon Si Hyun's here.

323
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:22,878
Kwon Si Hyun.

324
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,914
Kwon Si Hyun, what took you so long?

325
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,650
Wow, it's Kwon Si Hyun.

326
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,718
Let's go.

327
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:31,653
- What for? - We're leaving.

328
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:33,522
I don't want to.

329
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:35,724
That's him?

330
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:37,726
Take care.

331
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:40,495
- See you. - Bye.

332
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,598
- That's Kwon Si Hyun. - He drives a sports car.

333
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,366
A sports car? No way.

334
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,467
That's crazy.

335
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,310
(My daughter)

336
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:57,212
My goodness.

337
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,355
(Madam Myung)

338
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:15,797
(1 new text message)

339
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:22,504
Pick up. I heard you met Mr. Kwon.

340
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,106
Come home immediately.

341
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,560
Are you busy? I'm nearby. I'll come over.

342
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,662
Now?

343
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:50,298
- There's no room to park. - No.

344
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,667
- Come a bit later. - Here?

345
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,402
I'm almost...

346
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:56,638
You're not at the restaurant, are you?

347
00:23:57,005 --> 00:24:00,008
- What? - You went out, didn't you?

348
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:01,543
Will you wake up?

349
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:05,681
I am at the restaurant. Slow down.

350
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:08,517
I'm coming to check. Wait right there.

351
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:16,758
- Not that way. - Get going already, you fool.

352
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:20,028
Why did you grab me so tightly?

353
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:41,683
Gosh. Let's go home.

354
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:49,691
- Let's go home. - You go on your own.

355
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:51,493
You abandoned me.

356
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:53,729
Now, you'll give me a ride?

357
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:56,865
Why?

358
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:59,167
Why not carry me?

359
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,837
Like you used to.

360
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:03,972
Carry me and...

361
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:06,641
just...

362
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:10,145
throw me away.

363
00:25:17,152 --> 00:25:18,820
What do you want me to do?

364
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:42,277
Don't go.

365
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:48,350
Don't go.

366
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,385
We have to go home.

367
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,387
No.

368
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,823
I don't want you to go.

369
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:58,393
I said I was sorry.

370
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:10,238
I didn't...

371
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,207
I didn't...

372
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:15,977
I didn't keep my word and read the paper plane.

373
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:18,680
I said I was sorry.

374
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,749
I said that's not the reason.

375
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,651
Then what is it?

376
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,303
Let's stay like this for a while.

377
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,005
For just a while.
