1
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,511
Kyung Joo.

2
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:10,313
Kyung Joo.

3
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:11,314
(Episode 10)

4
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:12,515
Kyung Joo.

5
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:19,189
- Kyung Joo. - Will you stop calling me?

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,091
Have just one spoonful.

7
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:22,993
It'll taste really good.

8
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,397
Here. Open wide.

9
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,499
It's so annoying.

10
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,501
Mom's teasing me, isn't she?

11
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:35,405
I love hearing you speak Mandarin. Open up.

12
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,107
You hate me, don't you?

13
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:38,675
I go on a trip tomorrow.

14
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,444
Will you be responsible if I end up looking puffy?

15
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:44,180
Sorry.

16
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:47,284
All this will just go to waste.

17
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,127
Sit and have some.

18
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,103
Which is better?

19
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,105
From what standard?

20
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,843
Which would look nicer on me?

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,211
Are you going out?

22
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:16,913
I might have a brunch date.

23
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:18,715
Brunch?

24
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,117
You're half-dead on Saturday mornings.

25
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,919
Then you see a doctor in the afternoon.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,989
I need to have a day off.

27
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,925
What time are you leaving that you're getting ready already?

28
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:30,260
Some time before noon.

29
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,730
Are you going on a trip?

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,500
Yes. We're going to Si Hyun's villa, so don't ask.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,902
Which do you prefer?

32
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:41,304
They're both okay,

33
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:44,307
but to be honest, gray isn't your color.

34
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,143
You're always right.

35
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:48,912
Have fun.

36
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,984
What's going on? I feel worried.

37
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:06,730
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,398
Hey. Get in.

39
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,666
Are you sick?

40
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,002
Get in.

41
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:16,106
That's so old-fashioned.

42
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:17,607
Let's talk inside.

43
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,909
Geum Sil will be back from the store soon.

44
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,247
Why are you here?

45
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,853
- What are you doing? - Let's go on a trip.

46
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:32,989
- What? - I want to go somewhere new.

47
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:36,493
I drove, and you navigated with a map.

48
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:38,428
We got lost, had a huge fight,

49
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,330
and returned to Seoul, remember?

50
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,098
How could I forget that?

51
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:44,534
You mocked me so much for failing to read a map.

52
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:48,571
If we'd made it there, we'd have missed the boat back,

53
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,206
and history would've been different.

54
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,708
Whose fault was that?

55
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:54,377
Don't you remember you'd rarely driven before?

56
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:57,714
I said I'd drive, and you said driving was the man's job.

57
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,382
You were so stubborn.

58
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:03,787
That wasn't my fault. I'd always been driven about.

59
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:07,924
You're the only woman I ever drove in my car.

60
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:09,859
What a great honor that was.

61
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:13,763
You stayed in the first lane, so we couldn't eat or rest.

62
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,231
Do you remember that?

63
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,734
You remember everything, Young Won.

64
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:21,538
- I was that upset. - So let's go.

65
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:24,674
Now, I have a GPS, and I'm a good driver.

66
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:30,113
Sorry, but I didn't even bring my wallet.

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,915
Who cares?

68
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,217
I'm a vice chairman.

69
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,620
- Let's go. - Wait...

70
00:03:57,106 --> 00:04:00,477
Pervert. Sex maniac.

71
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,548
Why do I even like someone like him?

72
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:08,618
I must've lost my mind.

73
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,053
Are you going somewhere?

74
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,190
Isn't he going on the trip?

75
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm off to meet Kyung Joo. What about you?

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,962
I'm going home.

77
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:20,396
Mr. Landlord.

78
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:24,467
I'm a bit busy. Text me if you have any comments on the contract.

79
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:29,005
That's not the way to the library.

80
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,544
Did she hurt her ankle?

81
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,681
Mom, I'm leaving.

82
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,050
Kyung Joo.

83
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,555
I think I'll die. Save me.

84
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:48,625
What did you eat that made you sick?

85
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,159
I'm okay.

86
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:51,995
Go on.

87
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,797
How can I leave when you're squirming in pain?

88
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:57,433
Tae Hee, I'm really sorry.

89
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,202
You'll need to go ahead first.

90
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:02,171
Let's just not go.

91
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:05,375
No, I promised to watch a movie with Se Joo.

92
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,211
Okay, then.

93
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,547
Don't be too late.

94
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,317
Where are you?

95
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:17,520
Kyung Joo? I'm on my way to see the others.

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,155
About the trip.

97
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:21,925
Something came up, so I sent Tae Hee alone.

98
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,729
Can you pick her up? I'll come over in the evening.

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,898
What did she take?

100
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:43,947
Does he know it's his great-grandfather's memorial day?

101
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,716
He even stole a car.

102
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:49,352
Sure, do whatever you want.

103
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:53,456
Next year, we'll honor you too during the memorial service.

104
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,993
Why are you here? Where's Si Hyun?

105
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:58,728
You're upset to see me?

106
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:00,830
You should've picked up Kyung Joo.

107
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,565
Let's just go.

108
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,004
One,

109
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,707
two,

110
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,611
three. Now, slowly lower both arms.

111
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:20,116
Now, sit facing each other.

112
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,758
Did you find a school to accept your useless youngest?

113
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,526
Why would I send him to school?

114
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,428
I'll send him overseas.

115
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,230
Now, lift your legs.

116
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,432
I hate this the most.

117
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,838
Can't you send over one of Joosung High's math teachers?

118
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:43,506
Hye Jeong needs a tutor.

119
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:46,242
You can't say that to a teacher.

120
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,579
I have a license to teach.

121
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,848
Have you forgotten?

122
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,283
Now, the cat pose.

123
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,090
Then let me borrow Jeong Won's math tutor for a bit.

124
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,059
Jeong Won's so smart.

125
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,794
I'd rather lend you my husband.

126
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,996
Leave my kid's tutor alone.

127
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:10,466
Don't you see how desperate I am?

128
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,669
Hye Jeong has bad grades.

129
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,438
She should find something else to do other than studying.

130
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,407
What's with you all?

131
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,375
Stop saying that she has bad grades.

132
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,778
Stop being so mean, Ddal Mak!

133
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,250
Mr. Oh? You just teach yoga...

134
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,486
to Geun Sook, right?

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,921
Pardon?

136
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:38,428
Don't get nervous. I can keep my secrets.

137
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:49,005
Yes, it's me, Geun Sook.

138
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:50,173
Oh Ddal Mak.

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,609
I want to get some air.

140
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,045
Yes, of course, Se Ri.

141
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:59,582
I'll arrange something. Goodbye.

142
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:04,687
My goodness, Ddal Mak. You're so angry at me.

143
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:06,823
Mom, who's angry at you?

144
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:09,459
Go over there and eat. I have a headache.

145
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,927
Mom.

146
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,528
Is Ddal Mak someone's name?

147
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,598
Stop eating, and go study!

148
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,235
You are causing me so much trouble!

149
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:38,454
My goodness.

150
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,294
Aren't you going to have lunch?

151
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:22,632
I have to go to my office. I'll eat there.

152
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:23,900
Sure.

153
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,407
(Cheongpyeong Station)

154
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:37,313
- No, I'm going back to Seoul. - Can you please help me out?

155
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:40,316
I don't have an excuse to be there if you aren't there.

156
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,885
What am I going to do by myself...

157
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:45,454
until you get here?

158
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,824
Actually, Si Hyun went to get you.

159
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,126
You can go first and talk to them.

160
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:52,795
What? Hey, are you serious?

161
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,297
Tae Hee.

162
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,570
- What? - Why are you here?

163
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:03,673
- What? - Come. I'll take you back to Seoul.

164
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:05,541
No.

165
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,543
Why? Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

166
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,412
Don't worry.

167
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,714
I'm only going to stay until Kyung Joo gets here.

168
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:14,684
Gosh.

169
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:16,285
Get on my back.

170
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:17,920
Are you kidding me?

171
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,790
You're making me feel bad. You told me to go home before.

172
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,058
Are you kidding me?

173
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,627
Why did you come here with that ankle on a train?

174
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,665
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,502
I like the fact that you're here.

176
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,605
But I didn't know you were coming.

177
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,506
I didn't know you were coming either.

178
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,279
I'm sorry about not telling you about the building.

179
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,915
I found out recently that I was the owner.

180
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,319
That's very quick.

181
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:53,656
I was going to tell you over tangsuyuk.

182
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:56,592
Why did I leave the tools in there?

183
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,662
You're so lewd.

184
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,031
Hey, stop that.

185
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,300
You badmouthed me in German before too, right?

186
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,504
Didn't you think I knew that you called me an idiot...

187
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,273
when we first met?

188
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,775
I'm glad. I wanted you to know.

189
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:15,111
Goodness.

190
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:17,980
Anyway,

191
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:20,683
what did you just say? That was different.

192
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,321
I called you a pervert, a sex maniac, and lewd.

193
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,756
Something like that.

194
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:29,425
Right.

195
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,261
I've been meaning to tell you this.

196
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:36,198
Did you know that condoms can expire too?

197
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,868
Be careful.

198
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,306
- Come on. Let's go. - Right.

199
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,288
You're sound asleep.

200
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:01,857
You're the one who wanted to go out to get some air.

201
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,246
You must've lived such a busy life...

202
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,249
to forget to update this.

203
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:33,089
You still use the same cologne.

204
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:38,094
Why didn't you take it easy?

205
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:40,496
I don't blame you,

206
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:42,631
so you didn't have to live on the run.

207
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:55,211
I'm dreaming right now, right?

208
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,080
Yes.

209
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,965
Wow. You're rich.

210
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,827
(Delivery for Mr. Kwon Si Hyun)

211
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:46,862
Let's prepare some food before they get here.

212
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:47,930
Sure.

213
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:49,465
Let's go.

214
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,205
You can go first.

215
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,287
We have to make some rice.

216
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,060
- I can do this, right? - Please.

217
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,664
Go over there, and sit.

218
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,568
Stay seated. Your ankle still hurts.

219
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,637
I'm okay.

220
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,282
It looks like you know what you're doing.

221
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,784
I'm a good cook.

222
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,254
My mom loved to cook, so I watched her often.

223
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:46,522
We cooked together too.

224
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:50,126
Then why can't you make instant noodles?

225
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,927
It was the first time I had it.

226
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:53,729
What?

227
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:57,333
She never made me instant noodles.

228
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,902
My gosh.

229
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:05,007
Hey, all you had to do was drive according to the GPS.

230
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:08,277
You kept on talking next to me. I couldn't hear a thing.

231
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,946
If I didn't tell you, we would still be lost.

232
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:13,682
- Don't get in my car tomorrow. - I'm getting on Si Hyun's car.

233
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:16,352
I should get a license.

234
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:23,559
- I'm sorry. Have some. - Do you want to die?

235
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,162
- How is it? - It's good.

236
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,099
Where have you been?

237
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,567
Hey.

238
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,869
Hey, nice to see you.

239
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,738
We've met at school, right?

240
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:37,907
Gosh, it must've been a lot of work.

241
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:39,341
It must've been a long drive too.

242
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,877
No, I was fine.

243
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:43,279
Si Hyun did everything.

244
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,248
Really? I'm glad.

245
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,717
Go in, and get some rest. We'll finish up.

246
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:49,885
Okay.

247
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:53,022
I'm thirsty and tired...

248
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:54,223
because of someone.

249
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:01,163
I'll get you some drinks.

250
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:02,898
Are they in the fridge?

251
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:07,069
- Stay here. I'll get them. - No, you should grill meat.

252
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:08,704
Be careful of the stairs.

253
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,310
- Thanks, Tae Hee. - Sure.

254
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:20,482
You're here very early.

255
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:22,451
You guys arrived late.

256
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,153
The three of us were going to come together.

257
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:26,088
I suggested that we don't call Tae Hee here.

258
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,324
Kyung Joo wanted a chance to get closer to Se Joo,

259
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:31,260
- so I told her to bring Tae Hee. - I didn't say anything.

260
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,129
I went there to pick her up because Kyung Joo couldn't.

261
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:36,699
Good for Tae Hee.

262
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,701
You helped her out when she moved,

263
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,136
and you picked her up from the train station.

264
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:44,139
You're like a perfect boyfriend to her.

265
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:45,608
Shouldn't I be?

266
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,611
Can't you see that I'm doing something that you asked me to do?

267
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,248
I can.

268
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:55,017
That's why I invited her here, so keep it up.

269
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:56,986
Get some rest. I'll grill some meat for you.

270
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,656
- I'll do it. - It's too dangerous. I'll do it.

271
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:03,459
- I want to do it. I'm better. - No, it's really dangerous.

272
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,494
No, I'm doing it. Look, fire.

273
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:07,229
That didn't work.

274
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,103
Shall I push you?

275
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,504
Don't touch me.

276
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:22,411
We should've left them and gone to the east coast.

277
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:25,314
Are you pleased that Kyung Joo's not here?

278
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,416
Don't yell at me.

279
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,587
Don't you irritate me today.

280
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:41,163
Don't you do this.

281
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:44,266
Se Joo's great at grilling meat. His nickname is Mr. Grills.

282
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,901
Mr. Grills?

283
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,137
Lee Se Joo, get over here and start grilling.

284
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:52,174
Yes, ma'am. Mr. Grills is on his way.

285
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:54,943
- Mr. Grills? - He's really good.

286
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,513
Don't you touch anything. Get out of the way.

287
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:59,181
- It's dangerous. - Let's go.

288
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:04,386
Did you have some?

289
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,121
That's enough.

290
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,858
Eat this.

291
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,427
Thanks.

292
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,132
Here you go.

293
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:20,502
Give me that.

294
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:23,038
No forks? Give Soo Ji a fork.

295
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:24,406
I have one for her.

296
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,508
- Here you go. - Thank you.

297
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,611
- What do you want to drink? - Anything's fine.

298
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:32,948
There are tons of things to choose from. Drink what you want.

299
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:35,050
I heard you drink an infinite amount.

300
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:40,022
What? That sign and expression...

301
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:41,924
is Kyung Joo's trademark.

302
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,159
How did you know that?

303
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,531
I see Kyung Joo every now and then.

304
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:52,067
She talks about you a lot.

305
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,337
You can't say it's every now and then.

306
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:57,639
- When will you stop flirting? - What, Soo Ji?

307
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,210
I hope you two become a couple.

308
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:04,179
Kyung Joo's really upset that she couldn't make it.

309
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,483
I'm sure she'll come over with just Se Joo.

310
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,751
Right?

311
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:10,919
Soo Ji, have you had enough meat?

312
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:15,023
- Do you want more wine? - Sure.

313
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,828
- Why is she mixing drinks? - I'm getting worried.

314
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,134
This looks really tasty. I'll open it.

315
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:26,535
- Give me that. - I'll do it.

316
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:29,638
I'll do it. I want to open a bottle.

317
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,039
Hand it over.

318
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:34,410
She plays the cello, so she shouldn't hurt her wrists.

319
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:36,178
She doesn't use chopsticks for too long either.

320
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:38,680
I see.

321
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:41,583
You're all so close and kind.

322
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:48,123
Soo Ji, stop mixing drinks. Whom are you trying to torture?

323
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,558
I'll do what I want.

324
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,427
Aren't they too much?

325
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:55,564
I used my hands so often that they get tired very easily.

326
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:57,366
I hope you understand.

327
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:02,971
- Hello - Cheers.

328
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:04,540
Nice to meet you.

329
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,910
How long have you been friends?

330
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,711
Oh, since I had balls.

331
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:11,246
You moron.

332
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,649
What? That's what you say.

333
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,951
It sounds different when you say it.

334
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:18,020
Are you two fighting again?

335
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:24,326
Thanks.

336
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,896
Sorry if that phrase bothered you.

337
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:30,699
It's okay.

338
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:35,804
Anyway, a man and a woman can't just be friends,

339
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,706
but strangely enough, we three are different.

340
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,410
I'm jealous of you.

341
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,313
I don't have many friends from school.

342
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,851
We first met in art class in middle school.

343
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,655
Oh, so you took drawing lessons.

344
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,457
I knew it.

345
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:56,992
It wasn't much.

346
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:01,263
My parents had gotten divorced, and my dad went to prison.

347
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,432
The other kids laughed at me.

348
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,935
That must've been hard.

349
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,605
Do you know hardships?

350
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,274
What?

351
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:18,013
It's just that ordinary kids don't know what it's like.

352
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,716
Anyway, Si Hyun stood up for me, and so did Se Joo.

353
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,384
Why talk about those days?

354
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,855
Whenever we got together, we pranked the kids we disliked.

355
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:28,423
That's enough.

356
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,527
The assistant teacher majored in art in university.

357
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:33,328
- Why mention her? - She was pretty.

358
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,798
Then one day, she got jealous of me.

359
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,701
Her boyfriend had come to our art school,

360
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:43,472
seen me, and told her that there was a girl prettier than her.

361
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:46,174
You're telling that nasty story again.

362
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,111
Guess what we did?

363
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,480
These two bet on who could win her over.

364
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,849
I think it was Si Hyun's idea.

365
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:57,819
A boy in 9th grade is almost an adult. What happened was...

366
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,389
That's enough. Why keep talking about the past?

367
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,324
Okay, fine. I'll stop.

368
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,197
Was Si Hyun a good drawer in middle school too?

369
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:13,902
I was at his place last time and saw his drawing.

370
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:16,838
Don't be silly.

371
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,374
He hates to draw.

372
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:21,910
What?

373
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,946
We know him better than anyone.

374
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,515
He got told off all the time for doodling...

375
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:28,517
instead of drawing what he was told to in art class.

376
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:32,621
Si Hyun likes to draw? My goodness.

377
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:36,625
That's not true.

378
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:41,096
We make ceramic plates and things at a care home for the elderly.

379
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:43,732
Si Hyun's drawings are very popular.

380
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,168
And he enjoys painting too.

381
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:50,472
- Last time, he painted... - What are you talking about?

382
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,575
I hate to draw.

383
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,377
With a vengeance.

384
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:59,681
Kids like us are taught everything from an early age.

385
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,916
I was forced to learn.

386
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:03,685
Would I have enjoyed that?

387
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:08,357
See?

388
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,794
You didn't have to get so angry about it.

389
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:22,137
I'll go inside first.

390
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:24,139
I have to call Kyung Joo.

391
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:54,970
Ever seen a Jeju native before?

392
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:57,139
No, never.

393
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,541
Is Jeju that great a place to live?

394
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,010
Are you okay?

395
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:05,580
Yes. I'm not drunk.

396
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,517
What was that about, then?

397
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:10,252
What?

398
00:24:10,986 --> 00:24:12,754
I'm confused now.

399
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:18,627
Didn't you want Si Hyun to sleep with her then dump her?

400
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:24,066
So?

401
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,468
That's what's happening,

402
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:29,771
but why does it look like you're getting in the way?

403
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:35,177
Don't smile, and answer.

404
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:38,280
Si Hyun's playing the game.

405
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:40,182
What's wrong?

406
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:45,287
Is Si Hyun playing the game,

407
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:49,725
or is he putting on a show around us?

408
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,563
Neither of us can be sure.

409
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,527
Don't leave.

410
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,632
Stay.

411
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,634
Don't leave.

412
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:36,364
(Tempted)

413
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:37,766
Play the game.

414
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:41,069
That's what Si Hyun is doing. Why did he go to Soo Ji mid-meal?

415
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,437
I don't know...

416
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:44,172
if I like you or...

417
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,674
Is he playing a game...

418
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,676
or acting as if he's playing the game?

419
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:48,810
Aren't you confused?

420
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,178
Will you get a grip?

421
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:52,414
Choi Soo Ji.

422
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,516
Will you stay there?

423
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:57,819
Come on down, and eat with me.

424
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:00,422
I must be going crazy.

425
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:02,390
Why am I hearing his voice now too?

426
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,092
This is so annoying.
