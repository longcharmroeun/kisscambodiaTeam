1
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:12,148
"I'm a dangerous beast."

2
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,819
"When my hand touches you,"

3
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:20,724
"you become the unknown darkness."

4
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:28,365
"At the end of a shaking branch,"

5
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:36,539
(Si Hyun, the eldest son of JK Group's family)

6
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,576
"You bloom without..."

7
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,177
"any name..."

8
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,580
"then wither away."

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,386
(Soo Ji, the student president)

10
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:52,022
(She's the most beautiful celebrity.)

11
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:54,624
"This unknown darkness which makes you moved to tears..."

12
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,528
"is lit up by the memories."

13
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:02,565
"And I cry all night long."

14
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,803
"My cry eventually becomes..."

15
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,471
"the whirlwind of a night..."

16
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:10,774
"and shakes the tower."

17
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:13,643
(Se Joo, the alive guilty pleasure)

18
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:16,146
(The only English words he knows are love and sex.)

19
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:19,282
"It will then become a crack when it permeates the rock."

20
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:22,385
"Dear..."

21
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:25,955
"my bride..."

22
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:31,828
"in a veil."

23
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,169
Give him a round of applause.

24
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:55,652
(Episode 1)

25
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,509
He said he liked me,

26
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,411
so why did he do it?

27
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,412
(A day ago)

28
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:29,219
Wipe your tears with it. It's his handkerchief.

29
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:37,026
Forget about everything, and live as if he died.

30
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,629
You don't know when he'll show up again.

31
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:43,533
Please tell him...

32
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,170
that I'll wait for him no matter how long it takes.

33
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,373
What? He has the college entrance exam coming up. You can't handle...

34
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,111
My honey...

35
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:58,181
is a high-school student?

36
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,017
It's his third time taking the exam.

37
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,687
He'll fail again, so he has to serve in the military.

38
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,457
I see.

39
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,326
I'll go visit him then.

40
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,930
Gosh, what are you talking about?

41
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,766
You're such a competent woman, so stop being pathetic because of him.

42
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,002
I'm so speechless.

43
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,471
You have...

44
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,140
never loved anyone, have you?

45
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:43,059
Emotions that sway your entire life...

46
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:45,695
don't come so often.

47
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,564
It's all good then.

48
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:50,733
You've got memories.

49
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:54,270
Yes.

50
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:56,272
What a jerk.

51
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,108
How many women did he hurt?

52
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,578
So it wasn't just me.

53
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:03,947
But I guess you were special to him.

54
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:07,817
He told me to give you this message. He wants you to be happy...

55
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,252
without meeting men like him.

56
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,159
He's such a jerk,

57
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:19,896
but I love him so much.

58
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,169
Then...

59
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:29,506
Take care.

60
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,375
Wait.

61
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:37,780
I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,623
(Do Ji Young, lawyer)

63
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:48,291
(Fight for Trademark Rights)

64
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,560
She looks terrible.

65
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,463
Why'd you do it?

66
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,033
She laughed.

67
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,102
A toast.

68
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,810
I hope to see you again.

69
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:13,850
I couldn't stand it.

70
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:18,154
I guess, if you think about your mom.

71
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,123
I had to get rid of her.

72
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,025
Whoever she is.

73
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,429
Thanks for reading for us.

74
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:29,065
"Can I Sleep at Your..."

75
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,670
Wow, you're outright flirting with him.

76
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,805
- What? - Look at the title.

77
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:39,008
You're flirting with him. Isn't she?

78
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,277
It's not that kind of poem. Thank you.

79
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:45,348
Soo Ji you're into arts, so you don't get literature.

80
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:46,983
I'm top of my year.

81
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,452
Bye.

82
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:50,853
Teacher.

83
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,056
I thought about it,

84
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,025
and I won't have time to read.

85
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,794
I'll be busy with Soo Ji.

86
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,131
I just look at her face, and time flies.

87
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,668
Not in front of the teacher.

88
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,408
What?

89
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,611
You want to watch us kiss?

90
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:15,745
Don't mind her.

91
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,680
Focus on me.

92
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,492
Did you see that? She was jealous.

93
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:32,462
- She likes you. That's gross. - You're the jealous one.

94
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:35,431
Soo Ji, were you riling up the Korean Literature teacher?

95
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:36,933
Why are you even here?

96
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,167
To see you.

97
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,804
You psycho. Give my lollipop back. Open your mouth.

98
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:43,172
These are for you.

99
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,041
You weren't there yesterday.

100
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,346
(Report Card)

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,149
Our homeroom teacher's too nice.

102
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:55,985
You should study.

103
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:58,388
Your dead mom would be sad.

104
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:03,726
I was kidding.

105
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,163
What am I? I came last in the class.

106
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:08,531
Are you pleased?

107
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:18,241
I was kidding. Trash bag.

108
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,282
You're too righteous. What if you get hurt?

109
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:29,318
You're way too nonviolent. Why should we put up with that?

110
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,654
You're fighting over nothing again.

111
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:35,591
Why would I fight? I love you too much.

112
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,394
What is your problem? I'll kill you.

113
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:40,063
- Watch out. - My cello.

114
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:43,366

(Joosung High School Graduation)

(18th Graduation Ceremony)

117
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:55,411
Here.

118
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:03,019
(Joosung)

119
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,292
- Jin Young, Sung Joo, congrats. - Teacher.

120
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,627
Teacher, can I visit you often?

121
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,296
Why would you come back here?

122
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:15,531
Let's meet outside. I'll buy you drinks.

123
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:24,807
- Let's take a photo. - Shall we?

124
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:28,878
You're taking selfies.

125
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,280
Can I join in? Press the shutter.

126
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:34,250
A pervert to the end.

127
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,819
Class President, will your mom be here?

128
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,521
She's a bit busy.

129
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,757
Then give her a message.

130
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:44,193
She was the only one who voted against it,

131
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:46,129
but I got promoted in the end.

132
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,765
She won't care, but I'll tell her anyway.

133
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:51,167
No? Your dad went to prison,

134
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:53,603
and she's running the hospital on her own.

135
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:56,339
Do as she says, okay?

136
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,776
What'll you grow up to be? You'll never become a pianist.

137
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,244
I play the cello.

138
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,679
Take extra credit, and become a teacher.

139
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,182
Men don't want to marry jobless women these days.

140
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:09,652
You never know what'll happen.

141
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:11,788
I don't like teachers.

142
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,225
Hello there, Si Hyun.

143
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:18,561
Class Vice President, will your dad be here?

144
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:19,662
Of course not.

145
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:21,931
Who will the baby look like?

146
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,500
It'll be adorable if it doesn't look like me.

147
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,736
- It could look nothing like you. - What?

148
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:27,737
Right?

149
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,872
You never know.

150
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,808
Call me if you need a paternity test.

151
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,576
My dad's hospital will do it discreetly.

152
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:34,577
You...

153
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,781
Hello, ma'am and Mr. Chairman, sit at the front.

154
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,850
- Where will the honeymoon be? - Bali.

155
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,351
- Bye. - Thank you.

00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,493
(Four years ago)

157
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:56,299
It's important to observe the shapes,

158
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,601
but you must also feel its essence.

159
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,403
Feel the textures,

160
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:02,839
how the stem and leaves feel.

161
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,109
It's soft.

162
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,417
The petal. How does each petal feel...

163
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:15,918
Are you okay?

164
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:20,556
I like you.

165
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,893
You like me too, don't you?

166
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:26,195
Yes.

167
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,531
This is sincere.

168
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,032
Can you stay true?

169
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,956
Get a grip, and study.

170
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:56,859
You're such a flirt, going after adults and all.

171
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:04,367
Thank you.

172
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:10,840
That's insincere.

173
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:54,083
Gosh, that hangover.

174
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,384
Darn it.

175
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,055
The flowers are almost as pretty as you are.

176
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,823
Who's your mom?

177
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,932
You made it, Se Joo.

178
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:13,269
I told your Secretary Lee that you didn't have to.

179
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,137
The Chairwoman of the Board told a student...

180
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,673
not to attend his own graduation ceremony?

181
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,409
It's an opportunity to make amazing memories.

182
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:24,647
Ladies first.

183
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,518
Lady. Lady first.

184
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:36,292
Can you share the elevator with someone you don't even eat with?

185
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,461
Going up.

186
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:45,601
We shall begin Joosung High School's 18th graduation ceremony.

187
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,306
First, we shall sing the national anthem.

188
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,641
The national anthem.

189
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:57,947
The East Sea and Mount Baekdu

190
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,983
(Two months ago)

191
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,519
Korean Lit. and Art are getting married.

192
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,655
But Korean Lit. is dating our homeroom teacher.

193
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,125
Really?

194
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,329
Your motorcycle's mine if you're wrong.

195
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:15,264
Shall we watch a movie?

196
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:19,602
Don't you think it's wrong for a cheat to get promoted?

197
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,973
I got a camera rolling to shoot him and his bad ways.

198
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:25,441
Is it an expose?

199
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,543
No, revenge.

200
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:29,912
I prefer melodramas.

201
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,550
But...

202
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,453
Gosh, no way.

203
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:44,660
I'll put this together and finish it for you.

204
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,228
What's the title?

205
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,197
"Behave Like a Gentleman,"

206
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:50,966
"And I'll Want to Shoot".

207
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:19,295
1, 2...

208
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:21,097
Three.

209
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,569
- My goodness. - What is that?

210
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,138
What are you doing? What if someone catches us?

211
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:30,573
You're naughty.

212
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,676
- I can't believe it. - No way.

213
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:36,245
- What's that video? - That's our teacher.

214
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,647
- Come on. What's that? - This is unbelievable.

215
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,749
What's going on?

216
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,553
My gosh, how lovely.

217
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:48,791
- No way. - I can't believe this.

218
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:51,026
- Look at that. - How embarrassing.

219
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:53,729
I told you to keep him there even if you had to break his legs.

220
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,564
I'm sorry. I'm on it, ma'am.

221
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:58,234
Make sure you leave evidence. Evidence that he played it...

222
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:00,336
and made this video. Don't leave a single thing behind.

223
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,441
- Hey. - Come on.

224
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,243
Let's keep this civil, okay?

225
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:08,544
- Hey, no. You can't touch that. - Stop.

226
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:16,685
- That's all right. - That's all right.

227
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,893
The editing was done to perfection.

228
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:26,095
- I can't believe it. - What is all this?

229
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:29,532
- Was that really her? - Did you see that?

230
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,101
- Unbelievable. - My goodness, miss!

231
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,076
This is all yours.

232
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:42,945
Thank you.

233
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:45,181
When did you edit the video?

234
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,116
Choi Soo Ji, Choi Soo Ji.

235
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,555
Ko Kyung Joo, right? What is it?

236
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:55,658
I wanted to thank you for the video about the homeroom teacher.

237
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:57,293
I see. That was nothing.

238
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,695
You guys put together the video, right?

239
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,263
That was so cool.

240
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:02,565
- What video? - What do you mean?

241
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:03,599
- What? - Wait.

242
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,669
Aren't you going to take a photo? Do you want to take one together?

243
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,372
Sure, why not? Gather up. I'm the best photographer.

244
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,541
No, you should be in the photo too.

245
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,244
Okay. Let's take a photo.

246
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,379
All right. Look at the camera.

247
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:19,348
1, 2, 3.

248
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,384
We took a lot of photos.

249
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:23,419
- Let's go. - Let's go.

250
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,720
- Bye. - Go, go.

251
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,056
Bye.

252
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,491
But why did you go after the Korean teacher?

253
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:31,427
Didn't you want to avenge the art teacher?

254
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:33,662
- That was to get back at him. - What?

255
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:37,266
The whole school knows that he can't perform in bed.

256
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,201
A revenge couldn't have been better than that.

257
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,336
What do you mean?

258
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:44,907
He must've been pretty bad for her to sleep with our teacher, you know.

259
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,909
Think about how frustrated she must've been to look elsewhere.

260
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:47,977
- Se Joo. - My goodness.

261
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,745
That's all you think about, isn't it?

262
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,714
Don't be like that. It's the truth.

263
00:16:52,248 --> 00:16:54,683
I really believe you're talented when it comes to that.

264
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:59,154
Since you boys are all grown up, I'll teach you a few thing.

265
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:01,924
Do you know what the best revenge is?

266
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:06,362
It's taking the most cherished treasure from that person.

267
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,465
When people are robbed of their treasures,

268
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,068
they learn how to take revenge without even realizing.

269
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:22,678
- Are you all right? - What do you mean?

270
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,148
Forget it then.

271
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,284
Something is going on here.

272
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:31,320
Guys, we cannot be romantically involved. Okay?

273
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:33,088
- We cannot. - Ridiculous.

274
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,657
Don't overdo it, man.

275
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,392
- Guys. - Yes?

276
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,360
You should sleep with each other once.

277
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:39,995
I'll pretend I know nothing.

278
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,730
You deserve at least one night.

279
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,365
That's all right. It means nothing.

280
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:45,601
- He's crazy, right? You dirty jerk. - Hey.

281
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,136
- I'm going to lock you up. - Listen.

282
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:50,439
Just sleep with each other instead of going through emotional turmoil.

283
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,274
Come here. What did you just say?

284
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,842
This isn't the first time he's acting this way.

285
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:07,356
Choi Soo Ji.

286
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,091
Are you going to follow him?

287
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,327
"Follow him"?

288
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,595
I'm letting him escort me since he's here.

289
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:17,733
Hey, hey. A swan like you doesn't hang out with crows.

290
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,134
It's not a swan. It's a white heron.

291
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,136
- Anyway. - Be quiet.

292
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:25,341
Don't cause any trouble, and behave.

293
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:26,909
You're the one to talk.

294
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:31,213
He came all the way here to pick you up. He's already annoying.

295
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,015
Why don't you start speaking like an adult now?

296
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:34,650
You two. Don't call me.

297
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:39,555
What's a white heron?

298
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,990
I don't know. Soo Ji, you're coming over later, right?

299
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,859
Who would make the cocktails if you're not there?

300
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:44,960
Here.

301
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,933
What does she see in him?

302
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:54,002
Leave her alone. She'll dump him first.

303
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:58,073
Se Joo, do you want to work out?

304
00:18:58,207 --> 00:18:59,641
Should we?

305
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,760
We just graduated today.

306
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,261
We are old enough to drink now.

307
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,931
I'm a diligent Capricorn, and she's a crazy Aquarius.

308
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,800
- Cheers. - Cheers.

309
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:30,339
This is so bland. Kaoliang wine goes well with Chinese food.

310
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:35,010
A dropout with a GED got swagger in spades.

311
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,914
But why did you call me today? What about your parents?

312
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:40,649
They think the graduation is next week.

313
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:43,419
- What? - You don't understand.

314
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,721
Everyone at our school judges everyone's looks.

315
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:48,190
They always ask if I was adopted and am a foster child.

316
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,058
I have to take a photo with my mom too.

317
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,060
But how could you lie about your graduation day?

318
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:57,032
I mean, there are these crazy musketeers.

319
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:00,269
Well, they aren't crazy per se. They are just off-the-wall.

320
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,938
They made a mess at the ceremony today.

321
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,508
But why are you laughing then?

322
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:11,280
You like them, don't you?

323
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,415
Is that obvious?

324
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,018
What do you like about them? You said they are crazy.

325
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,987
They are cool because they are crazy.

326
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:24,259
Excuse me. A bottle of Kaoliang wine, please.

327
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,398
Here's Kaoliang wine.

328
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:32,100
That made me do some thinking.

329
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:34,970
Should I get the double-eyelid surgery?

330
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,639
Hey, you said you liked that you had single eyelids.

331
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,374
He has single eyelids too.

332
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:42,110
We are attracted to people with opposite DNAs.

333
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,679
This theory is in our textbook too.

334
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,713
Hold on.

335
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:47,015
Does he not like you because you have single eyelids?

336
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:50,018
Forget him. Tell him to get lost.

337
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,587
No, he didn't say that exactly.

338
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,490
Then did you not even tell him about your feelings?

339
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,391
It's embarrassing if he rejects me.

340
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,094
I was going to confess my feelings after the graduation.

341
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,731
If he doesn't like you after the surgery, will you have another?

342
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:05,734
How could you change yourself for whomever you like at the moment?

343
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:08,937
What are men, anyway? Will you die if you don't date?

344
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:12,107
Whenever I see you, I feel so pathetic. What can I do then?

345
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,642
Hey, Ko Kyung Joo.

346
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,211
You're a very nice girl.

347
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:17,513
What's wrong with you?

348
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:19,815
He's too handsome.

349
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:29,591
Noble and Law.

350
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:32,594
My gosh, I cannot ever get used to that name.

351
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,771
Where are you? Let's celebrate!

352
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:45,474
What did you do? How could you be celebrating out of all people?

353
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:47,876
I told you I'm not going. Just have fun by yourselves.

354
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:50,112
If you call me again, you're dead.

355
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:59,521
- What did she say? - She said she won't hang out.

356
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:00,722
Let's get out of here.

357
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:07,262
- Hey, you! - Hey!

358
00:22:07,763 --> 00:22:09,498
This is great. Do you want to join us?

359
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,133
Our seniors are buying us drinks tonight.

360
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:13,535
If you can do that for us, I'd be thrilled!

361
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:15,203
- I'll join you. Okay. - Come, come.

362
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,805
Hey, hey. Let's go. This way.

363
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:18,574
- Who is he? - Just someone I know.

364
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,443
He doesn't know about my family. That's why I like him.

365
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,419
I, her mother, am a beauty.

366
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:34,122
People always compare her to me.

367
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:37,225
She even lied about her graduation day.

368
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:39,962
Think about how devastated my daughter must have been.

369
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,869
Do you think I could go to her college graduation?

370
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,540
By that time, I won't look as pretty since I'd be old.

371
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,742
I wish my mom was as pretty as you.

372
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:54,943
- Me too. - So do I.

373
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:56,144
- Really? - I'd want that too.

374
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,680
- She's right. - Do you need anything else?

375
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,148
Order everything you want.

376
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:05,287
- Jung Na Yoon! - Jung Na Yoon!

377
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,923
- Fair-skinned Jung Na Yoon! - Fair-skinned Jung Na Yoon!

378
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:09,558
- Cheers! - Yes!

379
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:15,998
My daughter didn't answer my text.

380
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,467
Let's go out.

381
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:20,669
- I'm sorry that I keep crying. - Let's go out.

382
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:22,404
- Keep your chin up. - Hey, ladies.

383
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:27,109
These are my friends.

384
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:30,278
- Can they join us? - That'd be great.

385
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:33,215
- He's my type. - They look good.

386
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:34,416
- This is great. - Come here.

387
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,451
I'm with her.

388
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:39,755
- You have a weird, merciful heart. - Why? She's the prettiest.

389
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:44,326
Nice to meet you.

390
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:48,897
Hello.

391
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:51,333
- Have a glass. - Really?

392
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,934
- How much have you been drinking? - Cheers.

393
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:56,505
- Should we have a shot together? - That's great.

394
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:57,739
- Do you want a shot? - Yes.

395
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,574
- Cheers. - Should we clink our glasses?

396
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,109
The color looks beautiful.

397
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,883
Congratulations on your gradation, Soo Ji.

398
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,685
Congratulations.

399
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,053
Thank you.

400
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:14,056
Soo Ji, Ki Young must be your first love, right?

401
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,057
Sorry?

402
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:16,658
There you go again with your interrogations.

403
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:17,893
What about yours?

404
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,529
If she's not your first love, it'd be unfair for her.

405
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,831
Let's not talk about it. It's tacky.

406
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:24,199
I know who it is.

407
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,435
- What? - It's the daughter of his advisor.

408
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:29,004
He was only an undergraduate student then,

409
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:30,739
but he made up an excuse to visit his advisor's house.

410
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:31,840
Goodness.

411
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,342
So she's your future fiancee,

412
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:35,977
but you're not even over your ex yet?

413
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:37,646
So I'm your target today?

414
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,849
You're doing this so that I'll answer you quickly, aren't you?

415
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:45,954
Ki Young and I...

416
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,122
Soo Ji.

417
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:53,562
- Give us a moment. - Please.

418
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:14,416
You're an adult now,

419
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:16,084
so let's make our relationship clear.

420
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:18,386
Okay.

421
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:21,289
I'm...

422
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:23,391
just your male friend.

423
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:27,362
What?

424
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:29,765
While you prepared for your college entrance interview,

425
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:32,667
your mother asked me to give you some advice,

426
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,069
so that's how I got to know you.

427
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,405
Since then, we met up from time to time. I enjoyed our time together.

428
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:38,974
But you know,

429
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,912
this upper class network is narrower than you think.

430
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:50,051
You might not understand what this means because you're still young.

431
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,921
What does this...

432
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:55,223
It's not good for us both...

433
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,694
if the upper class people find out about our relationship.

434
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,268
But why are you telling me this today?

435
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:09,137
Why here?

436
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:12,641
I thought hard about this because you're so pretty.

437
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:15,076
But to be honest, Myoungjeong...

438
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:18,613
neither is wealthy nor has a good enough reputation.

439
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:22,851
Why did you date me in the first place then?

440
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,789
I really wasn't going to tell you this,

441
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:30,158
but when your father got arrested,

442
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:32,594
your family tried to hire an attorney from our law firm.

443
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,896
Our family declined it to the end.

444
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:38,600
He wouldn't have had to serve his sentence if we had defended him.

445
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:41,002
Anyway, your mother is impressive.

446
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,505
Still, she wanted to have me as her daughter's boyfriend.

447
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:48,410
Did you really not know about this?

448
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:55,784
Do tell her...

449
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:59,688
to be more realistic in choosing her future son-in-law from now on.

450
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:02,691
It'll be good for you too.

451
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,426
You're okay, right?

452
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:10,498
Do you want a glass too?

453
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:24,212
That was too harsh on her.

454
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,681
What a jerk.

455
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:28,316
I understand him though.

456
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:41,029
(Myoungjeong Hospital)

457
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm sorry that I couldn't go to your graduation ceremony.

458
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:10,058
Did you meet someone?

459
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,061
Lee Ki Young.

460
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,998
Let's go home.

461
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:18,733
Go without me.

462
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:23,838
It's good that you broke up with him.

463
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:26,007
I wasn't going to have you continue dating him anyway.

464
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:30,278
What is this about now?

465
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,118
Did you like him by any chance?

466
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:40,088
He wants you to be more realistic next time.

467
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:43,725
He could see your intention from the start, and he felt uncomfortable.

468
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:47,462
I thought he was smart, so why did he have to say such a thing?

469
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:50,265
It's his message to you, not to me.

470
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:57,038
Let me ask you one thing.

471
00:28:58,506 --> 00:28:59,874
Did you ask his law firm...

472
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:03,044
to defend Dad's case?

473
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:07,015
If they had defended him and if he hadn't been imprisoned,

474
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:08,750
would you not have abandoned him?

475
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:13,588
Soo Ji. I've never abandoned your dad.

476
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:15,924
I only protected the hospital.

477
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:33,608
- Try calling her. - Why isn't she coming?

478
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:36,277
- She's annoying. - She's the financier,

479
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,445
so she should come pay.

480
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:39,647
She's ill-treated by her daughter because she's slow-witted like this.

481
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,620
Isn't it boring?

482
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:48,690
Should we go somewhere else?

483
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:58,199
My seat is taken.

484
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:01,302
Why would you sit over there?

485
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:03,371
Your seat is here.

486
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:07,976
Go.

487
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:12,680
- Goodness. - That's cold-hearted.

488
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:17,786
What's wrong with sitting anywhere?

489
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,828
You've got great social skills,

490
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,064
seeing how you treat our big senior with courtesy.

491
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,466
Our big senior?

492
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:35,336
Gosh, I thought you two were the same age.

493
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,510
How old are you by the way?

494
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,079
You look pretty young.

495
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,450
Well,

496
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,919
I'm old enough to be casual with her.

497
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,958
Are you upset that I'm treating you casually?

498
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,528
Of course not. Treat me as you please.

499
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:02,797
Pour me a drink.

500
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:14,709
Hey, wait.

501
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:20,648
You're leaving?

502
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:22,750
No, I'm just looking for my friend.

503
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:29,691
Can I...

504
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:32,961
call you from time to time?

505
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:36,598
Of course.

506
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,572
Why did you cry? It makes my heart ache.

507
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:51,746
- Goodness. - My love, Si Hyun.

508
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:53,414
I'll see you later.

509
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:54,782
See you around.

510
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:00,989
What?

511
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,059
- Hey, that's alcohol. - Stop!

512
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:08,530
Hey. You...

513
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:17,872
Lee Ki Young...

514
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:22,143
criticized my mom, not me.

515
00:32:22,143 --> 00:32:23,878
But why do I feel so miserable?

516
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:27,048
No wonder you feel distressed.

517
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,350
Lean on me a little.

518
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,156
I hate my mom so much,

519
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:37,659
but I can't criticize her as well.

520
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:40,195
How should we repay this debt to that punk?

521
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:44,532
He's well-off, but it doesn't give him the right to look down on her.

522
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,870
Do you think my mom is that weird like a witch?

523
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,206
- No. - No. What are you talking about?

524
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,244
You're on my side, right?

525
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:57,879
- Of course. - Of course.

526
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:00,582
Thank you.

527
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:04,285
I didn't have a good feeling about you going there from the start.
