00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:08,915
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:31,375
Soo Ji, the announcement caught me by surprise.

3
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,505
Were you in the dark about this too?

4
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:37,015
My goodness, you should've at least given me a hint about them.

5
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:46,825
I'm leaving now.

6
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,385
Si Hyun.

7
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,325
Don't drink a lot.

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,565
I get that he's shocked,

9
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,035
but how could he leave without saying goodbye to me?

10
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,635
Shouldn't we be celebrating? Isn't this a happy occasion?

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,575
Ki Young.

12
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,175
Shut your mouth if you're not going somewhere with this talk.

13
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:08,845
Got that?

14
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,775
Se Joo, watch your tone with me.

15
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,870
I'm saying this because I'm worried about you guys.

16
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,470
What makes you worry about us?

17
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,885
What do you want to know now? What would you have done if you'd known?

18
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:22,355
Forget it.

19
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,655
I wonder why my family didn't tell me about their relationship.

20
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:28,165
Had I known this,

21
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:31,295
I would've told you in advance to lessen the blow.

22
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:34,230
I had been so inconsiderate. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,560
Darn it. You've got to be kidding me.

24
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you bragging about your family's influence now?

25
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,730
She's in pure torment now.

26
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,045
If you have eyes, look. If you have a brain, know when to be quiet!

27
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:49,545
Stop it.

28
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,255
Go to Si Hyun.

29
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:55,925
I told you to go.

30
00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:57,825
Call if you need anything.

31
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,805
Gosh, what losers.

32
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:10,575
They have no brains and rely only on money.

33
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,960
Why would someone as smart as you...

34
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,505
hang out with him?

35
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:15,905
Lee Ki Young.

36
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,245
A guy I know.

37
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:21,810
- What? - Guys like Se Joo...

38
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:24,515
who have money but no brain is a loser.

39
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,850
I'm a loser by association.

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,680
What do you call people who mock them...

41
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:30,925
but try to befriend them?

42
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,565
You're lashing out because you're too sensitive.

43
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:39,595
Yes. I was narrow-minded for a short while.

44
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,265
Get over it.

45
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:44,805
- Shall we go out for a drink... - Stop acting so chummy.

46
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,205
Soo Ji.

47
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:49,505
Sickening, right?

48
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,700
I have no fame or fortune,

49
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,115
but I have a temper, and you can't stand it.

50
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:59,115
That's why you should pick a more realistic partner.

51
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:01,655
Unless you want to end up with a loser like me.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,750
Be stupid or rude. Just stick to one thing.

53
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:11,365
I see you're in no condition to talk.

54
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:14,265
See you around.

55
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:32,315
- Well done, everyone. - Good job.

56
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:35,850
Are we celebrating too early?

57
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:38,020
What if no one comes to the opening tomorrow?

58
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,255
Then...

59
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,220
we'll drink something else.

60
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:44,390
You're pretending to be strong and tough.

61
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,860
You've been stressed ever since you decided to exhibit.

62
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:49,930
Don't even mention it. Her stomach cramped up many times.

63
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,105
You scared us both.

64
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,805
Sorry about that.

65
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,275
We got things ready, thanks to you three.

66
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:59,240
What will I do if they all sell?

67
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,410
- As if they would. - They will.

68
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,515
I'll sell every single vase.

69
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:06,615
They only feel like mine when I'm making them.

70
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,455
I'll sell them all...

71
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,180
for my daughter.

72
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,450
Oh dear.

73
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,850
You're putting on this exhibition to pay your kid's tuition.

74
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,290
This is for her too.

75
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:17,790
It'll be a success.

76
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:20,090
It's your first, private exhibition in 10 years.

77
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:23,290
There were a lot of articles on you, and you did some interviews.

78
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:26,535
Stop saying that. And stop trying to make me feel good.

79
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,970
Oh dear, that light went out.

80
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,810
I'll fix it.

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,410
No, no, leave it. Finish your food.

82
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,255
That's why she never gains weight.

83
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:42,280
- Sit down. - Okay.

84
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:45,350
- Well done. Good job. - Thank you.

85
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:48,295
(Seol Young Won's Exhibition)

86
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,235
Tae Hee.

87
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:01,730
Hi, Auntie.

88
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:04,875
If you came all the way here, you might as well come in.

89
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,485
Have fun.

90
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:13,855
You look pretty today.

91
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,590
- What's this? - For four years,

92
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:23,865
I get tuition and a dorm room.

93
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,495
Good for you, Eun Tae Hee.

94
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:29,305
You should've told me you'd be awarded one of these.

95
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:33,375
I said I'd move out of the apartment. The allowance...

96
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:38,175
I know you worked hard. I'll pay it back.

97
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,115
Don't pay it back.

98
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:46,915
I'll keep sending your allowance.

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,285
I closed the account.

100
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,625
You don't have to pretend to be a good mom.

101
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:53,720
You can stop being my sponsor.

102
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:56,990
How can you say that? I'm your mom, not a sponsor.

103
00:05:56,993 --> 00:06:00,020
Didn't you know that people like you are called sponsors?

104
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,930
It's not responsibility based on love.

105
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,490
You just pay the bills...

106
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,900
and check the corpse if you ever hear I'm dead.

107
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,005
Eun Tae Hee.

108
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:09,745
Must you be like this when we met after so long?

109
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,315
It's been so long that you must've forgotten.

110
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,785
Shall I remind you what you're like?

111
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:19,280
You sent us to Germany and never called for four years.

112
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,910
Meanwhile, you divorced Dad...

113
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,425
and gave him the parental rights.

114
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:26,295
I had no idea.

115
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,295
Each time I lit candles on my birthday cake,

116
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,865
I wished that our family would live together again.

117
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,435
The three of us.

118
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:41,745
I'm an adult now,

119
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,815
and we can part ways.

120
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:46,245
I came to tell you I'm okay.

121
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:47,815
Right.

122
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,415
You turned 20 last week.

123
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,610
I was so busy preparing for the exhibition that...

124
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:57,755
Don't be silly. You even sent a cake.

125
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,425
Tae Hee.

126
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,495
I'll never see her again. Never.

127
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:42,935
I won't see her.

128
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,035
Never again.

129
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,735
Are you crazy? You can't just walk into the road!

130
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,375
Darn it.

131
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:34,255
Hey. You're okay, aren't you?

132
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,985
I didn't hit you, right?

133
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,525
Don't go.

134
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,365
Don't leave me. Please stay.

135
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:49,105
Now, you're just going overboard.

136
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,375
Don't go.

137
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,285
Don't go.

138
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,755
Don't go.

139
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,525
Get up.

140
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:13,995
Get up.

141
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,105
Let go.

142
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:28,075
Gosh.

143
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,615
Let's make it clear.

144
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,745
I didn't cause that.

145
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,515
Forget it.

146
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:46,395
Call me. I'll compensate you.

147
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,550
- What? - Where are you?

148
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,190
- The parking lot. In an accident. - Get over here. Soo Ji...

149
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,495
What about Soo Ji?

150
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,865
Okay, I'm coming.

151
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:56,535
But...

152
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:03,945
(Kwon Si Hyun)

153
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,245
"Si Hyun." That's his name?

154
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,085
Don't.

155
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:26,095
Put it down, Soo Ji.

156
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:30,235
Do you hear Mom's voice?

157
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,075
Put that down. Let's talk.

158
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:36,375
What more do you want from me?

159
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,975
What more must you take from me?

160
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,955
Soo Ji. What's wrong?

161
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,255
No, Soo Ji!

162
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:47,885
No.

163
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,025
Don't get any closer.

164
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,995
Soo Ji, come on! Get a grip!

165
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,535
I'm here. Talk to me.

166
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:07,235
Si Hyun.

167
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,375
What happened to you? Are you hurt?

168
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:15,945
No, I'm okay. It's nothing.

169
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:20,255
It's okay.

170
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,755
It'll be okay.

171
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,855
It'll be okay.

172
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,535
The people I like...

173
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,735
all disappear.

174
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,645
I won't disappear.

175
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:44,515
I'm right next to you.

176
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,485
What now?

177
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,215
You two are all I have.

178
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:55,455
Don't worry.

179
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,725
I'm on your side.

180
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:00,625
I'm on Choi Soo Ji's side.

181
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,725
I'm on your side.

182
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,735
I'm on Choi Soo Ji's side.

183
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,115
Don't you have anything better to do than stealing a car?

184
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,715
And the car you stole was your friend's dad's car.

185
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:09,025
You are good for nothing.

186
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:10,855
Hit him again.

187
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:12,380
Yes.

188
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:13,855
Father.

189
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,465
Please calm down, Father.

190
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,905
Se Joo did nothing wrong.

191
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,235
You should just beat me instead.

192
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,175
I thought I could treat him well...

193
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,145
at school and at home with everything I had...

194
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,205
for the three years of his high school...

195
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:32,945
to get him to realize how he is so dear to me.

196
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,115
But I haven't done enough.

197
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,515
It's my fault, Father.

198
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:52,235
That end seat right there. Tell Jeong Won to come and sit.

199
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:00,800
That's Mom's spot.

200
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:01,905
Quiet.

201
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,440
If you want to have a say, go to college.

202
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,945
Or go make money.

203
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,640
I've done enough to raise you until now.

204
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:11,715
I want my eldest grandson to sit there. Any problems?

205
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:15,755
Father, Jeong Won is a senior in high school,

206
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:17,625
so he left for school very early.

207
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:21,050
So I will tell him and make sure he comes starting tomorrow...

208
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:22,465
Then you can sit.

209
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,460
Stop bothering with his studies.

210
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,735
What?

211
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,005
Thank you.

212
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,560
Thank you, Father.

213
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:31,660
Instead,

214
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,570
find a school where we can throw him into.

215
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,705
Yes.

216
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,575
I will do my best, Father.

217
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,705
What is this?

218
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,780
How many digits can we use as a passcode?

219
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,395
Fourteen?

220
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:43,705
Hey, I have someone exactly like Jeon Do Yeon at my house.

221
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,615
Her acting improves by the day.

222
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:50,515
"Please calm down, Father. It's my fault."

223
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:55,485
How does she live with so much talent?

224
00:16:58,654 --> 00:16:59,755
(Lovely Third Brother)

225
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:03,150
You should've left the car there. Why did you take the blame?

226
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,020
You have no place to go and no money.

227
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:09,560
They can't kick you out of there because I stole your dad's car.

228
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,000
Make sure you keep my room safe.

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,405
Okay. I'm sorry.

230
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:14,745
How long will you be locked up?

231
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:16,705
I just have to...

232
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,840
stick around like a piece of wet tissue.

233
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,145
My savior will find me.

234
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:26,280
Right, how's Soo Ji?

235
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:28,585
No idea. I haven't called.

236
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:32,595
Figures. What can you two talk about right now anyway?

237
00:17:51,507 --> 00:17:53,145
How long have you been taking the pills?

238
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,180
Let me make it easy for you.

239
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:03,755
The tranquilizer you're taking now shouldn't be taken with alcohol.

240
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:07,180
You can never know when you're going to pass out...

241
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:09,690
and not realize the things which you're going to do. Get it?

242
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:11,990
Why didn't you tell me before? Why are you telling me now?

243
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:14,235
Because you haven't been drinking until now.

244
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,575
You knew your high school daughter was taking psychological medicine,

245
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,070
but it's okay because she didn't drink. Is that so?

246
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't be childish.

247
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:24,675
Everyone is sick in their own ways.

248
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,245
I believe those who know that they need medicine...

249
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:29,610
and take them are rather healthy.

250
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,655
That's what you believe as Doctor Myung.

251
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,210
Who gave you the prescription?

252
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:37,250
Don't worry. He's not a quack.

253
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:38,555
Choi Soo Ji.

254
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:43,465
I'm glad that you don't call me Kwon Soo Ji yet.

255
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,835
It was your medicine.

256
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,175
You had no idea?

257
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,475
My head hurts.

258
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,415
You should get to work.

259
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:48,995
Where's Si Hyun?

260
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:54,360
He went on a senior trip with his friends.

261
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:56,105
You look worn out.

262
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:57,860
Is work taking a toll on you?

263
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:58,930
I'm fine.

264
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,935
If you can't take care of yourself,

265
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:04,445
how could I relax and leave the company with you?

266
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,970
Congratulations on your wedding, Uncle.

267
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:09,010
Was it your idea to break the news...

268
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:10,645
of your wedding at that time?

269
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:11,810
I apologize.

270
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:14,180
All of the damage that Bio Medicine has done to our group...

271
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:16,680
cannot be undone with just filling in the losses.

272
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:19,425
Everything will be ruined if Tiuzen's release gets canceled.

273
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,495
That's the only reason why I'm letting you marry her.

274
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:24,820
Yes, I understand.

275
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:26,165
Keep that in mind.

276
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:30,935
I only let you become the vice chairman because of Si Hyun.

277
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,135
Everything which your brother couldn't enjoy...

278
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:36,345
should be left for her and Si Hyun.

279
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:38,315
Grandma.

280
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:40,475
Si Hyun...

281
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:43,015
wants to do something else.

282
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:44,880
That's what kids are like when they're young.

283
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,015
It was like that for you and your brother.

284
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,455
There will come a day when he will accept...

285
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,655
that living as an heir is his job.

286
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:55,225
And it's your job to get him to accept that.

287
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:58,260
Si Hyun's mom passed away like that because of you.

288
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,765
There's no way he'll listen to you.

289
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:02,135
Don't push him.

290
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:06,360
If you don't feel confident, she can take him and teach him.

291
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,970
Si Hyun listens to everything that she says.

292
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:12,845
Grandma, I'll talk to Si Hyun when I come back here.

293
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,945
- It's cold. Let's go. - Okay.

294
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,510
Stock prices for our pharmaceutical, Bio Medicine's subsidiaries,

295
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,020
and companies related to Myoungjeong Biotech are rising.

296
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:29,995
The industry believes Myoungjeong will be back-door listed through us.

297
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:31,990
What about the executives and shareholders?

298
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:33,765
They look quite glad...

299
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,265
that the news of the wedding was released before the merge.

300
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:40,505
It wasn't a bad timing to bring up the wedding.

301
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,675
Of course. It's President Myung.

302
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:46,615
Can you check my schedule for the first half of the year?

303
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,745
I'm not sure if there's enough time to get married.

304
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,225
I came to tell you something.

305
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,465
I'm sure you're here to ask me for a favor.

306
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:07,795
The damaged car.

307
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,390
It has nothing to do with Se Joo, so please tell his family...

308
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,600
You want me to give them a call? "It's my son's fault."

309
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:16,930
"I sincerely apologize." Something along this line?

310
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,275
Please call them for me.

311
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,400
It wasn't his fault.

312
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:22,645
Do you think I didn't know that when I called them about the car?

313
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,485
You think I did that just to get the repair fee?

314
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:26,940
What is it that you want?

315
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:29,125
Make good on the promise you made when I kicked you out.

316
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,455
I don't care what you do with your life.

317
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:33,095
Live your life within the boundary I set up.

318
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:37,725
If you were that furious, you should've driven off a cliff.

319
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:40,065
But you made a mess where everyone could see you.

320
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:41,935
You were giving me the finger.

321
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:43,690
Wasn't that it?

322
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:45,975
Is that why you announced your wedding at the event?

323
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:50,205
Were you trying to stab your incompetent son in the back?

324
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,645
It's only been two years since Mom passed away. Did you even know that?

325
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:08,795
Are you proud of yourself now?

326
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:10,825
If your mom were to stand before you now,

327
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:14,635
could you be certain that you had been a good son to her?

328
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:18,735
What can you do on your own?

329
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:22,545
You enjoyed privileges from us, but you don't want us to interfere?

330
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:25,745
Don't fool yourself.

331
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:28,215
Right now,

332
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,785
you are the most pathetic since birth. Did you know that?

333
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:42,995
He didn't set a date for the wedding, but it'll happen soon.

334
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,565
The chairwoman also approved.

335
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,535
To expand our business in bio industry,

336
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:49,165
we really need Myoungjeong Stem Cell Center.

337
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:52,100
What about the cultural foundation Mom used to run?

338
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,075
Myoungjeong Foundation will take over probably.

339
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:58,475
I know what you're worried about.

340
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,985
Vice Chairman Kwon wasn't favorable of the foundation.

341
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,735
Grandma said she didn't like this piece.

342
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:27,435
I know. I told her I wanted to place it here.

343
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:31,130
Mom, why do you like this piece?

344
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:34,175
It's untitled and done by an anonymous artist.

345
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,215
When I look at this piece,

346
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:40,055
I feel like I'm the owner of this place.

347
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:01,770
Se Joo, a package was delivered for you.

348
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,245
I'll come in for a moment.

349
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:04,845
(Loading)

350
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,485
My gosh, what a view.

351
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,395
I guess something like this flusters Se Ri.

352
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,420
What package?

353
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:26,235
When you have cabin fever, online shopping is the remedy. Right?

354
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:30,235
My gosh.

355
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:35,405
Seriously. You're the only one who understands what I go through.

356
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:48,755
I'm hungry.

357
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:53,395
She should've given me some food. Why did she give me only the ropes?

358
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,535
I'm dying here.

359
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,845
Gosh, I'm starving.

360
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:17,645
Darn it.

361
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,065
Hey, you're here.

362
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,605
Here.

363
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,860
You're the best. How did you know I got beaten up?

364
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,905
Is there a day when you didn't?

365
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:50,485
Would you like some pizza, my friends?

366
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:09,305
My gosh.

367
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,770
Look in a mirror, and apply it.

368
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,345
Don't play the victim. It doesn't suit you.

369
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:25,210
They will beat you up more now. Why did you escape?

370
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:28,255
I don't know what's going on with you. How could I stay there?

371
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,250
Yes, I am shocked about this development,

372
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:32,950
but what good will it do if we do nothing?

373
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:35,895
The thought of you two becoming a family...

374
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:37,120
Anyway, it creeps me out.

375
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,495
What can you do? You can accept each other as family,

376
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:44,565
cherish each other, take care of each other,

377
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,575
and get along with each other just like now.

378
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:47,735
"Family"?

379
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,745
It's the same for your family and mine.

380
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,515
Is there anyone in our family who really cares about us?

381
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:58,480
At our house, the war of siblings is taking place all year around.

382
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,240
It's not that bad. It's fun to watch it.

383
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm sure they will think of ways...

384
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,925
to either kick me out or take something of mine...

385
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:08,795
if we become family.

386
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:13,165
My mom can't know that you left home.

387
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:14,665
Don't let her find out.

388
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,205
If she finds out,

389
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,235
she will be so happy.

390
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:25,615
She will think it will be easy to take what's yours.

391
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:31,215
The three of us won't be able to hang out anymore.

392
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:36,725
But is there anything we can do? Should we go on a hunger strike?

393
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,425
As if that's going to help us. My goodness.

394
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,475
Should we get married before they do?

395
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:04,210
That's right. You two should beat them to it.

396
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:06,880
- Give them the big, fat finger! - You've gone mad.

397
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:09,655
The companies will merge anyway. Who cares who gets married first?

398
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:13,120
This is why I gave up studying film.

399
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:15,165
Films can't get as good as this.

400
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:20,895
I will make you an offer you can't turn down.

401
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:23,660
This marriage is like a noir film.

402
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:26,330
Both of you, cut it out. I'm not in the mood for this.

403
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:29,205
You don't want to? We can get a divorce later.

404
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:34,475
I guess you really hate the idea of my mom becoming your stepmom.

405
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,710
What choice do I have? It's not like I can seduce your mom.

406
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,710
Hey, you're crossing the line.

407
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:42,810
Come on. Chill out. Let's not fight.

408
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,910
You, punk. You have a great idea.

409
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,580
Let me see. "To register marriage..."

410
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,165
Fine. Say that we do get married.

411
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:53,190
Let's pretend that I became the wife of JK Group's grandson.

412
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,890
Hey, it's really easy to register marriage.

413
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:57,330
You just need to go to the borough office with your ID. It's easy.

414
00:29:57,332 --> 00:30:00,700
What if I try to get the whole thing like my mother?

415
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:03,145
- What would you do then? - Take it.

416
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:05,740
- What? - You can take it.

417
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,975
Kwon Si Hyun.

418
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:14,285
I get that you're trying to get back at your father,

419
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:16,325
but don't get me involved in this.

420
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:20,695
Hey, there are other ways I can make him angry.

421
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:25,360
Hey, getting a divorce is messy. You need to go to court for that.

422
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,195
Do you even grasp the concept of divorce?

423
00:30:27,262 --> 00:30:29,505
Look up Myoungjeong Hospital now.

424
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,660
After his business went under,

425
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,230
he got divorced and sent to prison.

426
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:35,205
And me, the daughter between those two.

427
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,245
Every little detail is on there.

428
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:41,545
No matter how hard you try to erase it, it will keep coming up.

429
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,485
You want me to go through that again?

430
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:47,840
Seriously.

431
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,985
Thinking about marriage and divorce makes me feel jaded about life.

432
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:54,095
Let's stop writing a scenario and come back to our reality.

433
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,935
Hey, where are you going?

434
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,535
The sun has gone down.

435
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,230
You said you were worried about us.

436
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:08,360
Yes, but I'm even more worried about the ladies waiting for me.

437
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,545
Have fun here.

438
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:13,815
Hey, make sure you get yourself back to your house. Okay?

439
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,005
Kwon Si Hyun.

440
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,315
Are you really thinking about marrying me?

441
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:46,675
Yes.

442
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,710
I didn't ask you if you wanted juice.

443
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,570
I asked you if you wanted to marry me.

444
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,755
I know.

445
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:56,385
I don't want...

446
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:58,455
a fake marriage.

447
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,495
Then what's a real marriage?

448
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,265
Have you ever seen one?

449
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,795
You haven't.

450
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:09,465
Then why do you hate it?

451
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,895
You, me, and Se Joo.

452
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:38,025
We probably can't get married to someone as we like.

453
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:42,005
So that's why we don't want to get married.

454
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,265
Even if you do get married,

455
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:47,005
it's probably far from the marriage you dream of.

456
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:49,645
Our marriage is...

457
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,745
like a joker card for our parents.

458
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:56,315
Let's use that to our advantage.

459
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,785
You can use me as a joker too. Make use of me.

460
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:02,225
If you don't want to get divorced, you don't have to.

461
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,425
If you want anything, get everything you want.

462
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,255
I don't care.

463
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,025
No.

464
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:12,695
Why?

465
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,265
You told me to use you.

466
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:19,635
You're telling me to make use of you...

467
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:22,445
because my mom is using your family.

468
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:27,170
You were sympathizing me. I thought you were being nice.

469
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,275
No.

470
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,645
I'm trying to keep what's mine.

471
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,955
It's a deal.

472
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:35,755
You don't need a deal. You have everything.

473
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,795
Do you still like me?

474
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:48,495
If what you're trying to save is not me, but our friendship,

475
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,330
then this is a fake marriage.

476
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,675
No, it's not fake.

477
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,245
Then...

478
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,815
can you kiss me?
