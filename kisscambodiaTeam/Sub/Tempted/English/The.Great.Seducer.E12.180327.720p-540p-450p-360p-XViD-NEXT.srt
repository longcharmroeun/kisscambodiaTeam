1
00:00:06,276 --> 00:00:10,085
I'll be nice when I want to be and will say when I'm upset.

2
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:13,210
I'm Eun Tae Hee. I'd rather not date at all.

3
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:14,485
What, flirt?

4
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:16,285
I won't do that.

5
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:21,265
Okay. That's a great attitude.

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,960
Hey. If I ever let him get on my mind,

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,535
just slap me.

8
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:34,245
Then will you eat with him tomorrow?

9
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:36,545
Of course, I'll eat with...

10
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:39,400
I must be going crazy.

11
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,385
Why am I hearing his voice?

12
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,425
Let's eat out tomorrow.

13
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,320
If I'm free.

14
00:00:57,327 --> 00:01:00,160
Okay, see you. Bye, Kyung Joo.

15
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:01,305
Bye.

16
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,305
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

17
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,770
Lee Se Joo will help Choi Soo Ji...

18
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:16,340
become a successful celloist...

19
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:18,215
through material and moral support.

20
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:20,680
Choi Soo Ji will hire Lee Se Joo first...

21
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,550
when she needs an assistant.

22
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:24,755
He scribbled on my music?

23
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:27,365
Darn it.

24
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:48,445
What he did during the 23 days you ordered house arrest.

25
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,715
Here's the report.

26
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:53,585
Five official outings that you approved of.

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,450
To get treated for his torn lip and sprained ankle...

28
00:01:56,453 --> 00:02:00,055
and to get a physical check-up, we contacted Myoungjeong Hospital...

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,095
and sent him over.

30
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,730
(Absent Without Leave, no permission)

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,030
He sneaked out 8 times and slept out 8 times.

32
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,535
He slept out a total of 12 nights.

33
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:16,045
Once he sneaks out, he stays out for two nights.

34
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,545
During the past 23 days, the number of days he was home...

35
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:22,270
was just the one day you grounded him.

36
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:24,715
Why haven't you starved to death yet?

37
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:27,080
How do you manage to look so well?

38
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,980
Who ignored my orders...

39
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,650
and fed this fool?

40
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:34,450
Who let him get loose and run wild? Who was it?

41
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,795
It was my oldest brother.

42
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:38,935
He gave me a credit card and a car.

43
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:42,435
Didn't you, when we met in Gangnam?

44
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,475
Hey. That was... He's still young.

45
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:49,200
I thought we should let him grow up.

46
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,475
I apologize.

47
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:51,775
Father.

48
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:55,245
Send him to the US when your son goes over for work.

49
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:58,810
I'll make it my mission to find a university he can study at.

50
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,185
Se Ri.

51
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:02,425
It's harder to get into a university there.

52
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:05,150
Not to mention that he hasn't served in the army yet.

53
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:06,755
Sure, I'll go.

54
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:09,320
I'll go abroad.

55
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,665
It's no big deal.

56
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,995
Not the US though.

57
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:15,865
The only two English words I know are love...

58
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,230
and sex.

59
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:21,445
S-E-X. That's it.

60
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:23,775
That's probably all I'll do there.

61
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,870
- Dad. Dad. - Dad. Dad.

62
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,480
- Father. - Dad.

63
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,955
Be gentle. Father.

64
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:36,610
- Father. Father. - Dad. Dad.

65
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,655
- Dad. - Father.

66
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,205
Gosh, that hurts.

67
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,245
Se Joo.

68
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,985
This will help you feel better.

69
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:07,325
Drink it up.

70
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,585
Thank you.

71
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:14,865
It looks more like poison.

72
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:17,465
So...

73
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:20,765
did you get on your brother's good side?

74
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:22,530
Why did he give you a credit card?

75
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,675
I'm really so curious about you.

76
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:28,345
I can't tell if you're friend or foe.

77
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:30,515
You fool.

78
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,245
You can't divide this household like that.

79
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,445
You're right.

80
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,755
Se Joo.

81
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,385
Right.

82
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:46,695
Could your husband have women issues?

83
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:49,820
Father would be furious if he were to find out.

84
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,335
You don't yet...

85
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:54,460
seem to know that that's not a big deal in this family.

86
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,805
How much he spent will be though.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,705
Your husband can be very generous.

88
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:01,075
Sisters-in-law.

89
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:05,375
Can you please do this somewhere else?

90
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,145
I'm exhausted.

91
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:23,765
What are you up to? Let's go work out.

92
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,895
Can't. I have to meet someone.

93
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:28,565
Tae Hee?

94
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,705
Why are you meeting her now? Meet her at night.

95
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:47,810
Soo Ji, I'm bored.

96
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:49,755
Hey... Hello?

97
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,895
Gosh, this is so annoying.

98
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,160
Tae Hee went to work. You can find her there.

99
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:06,705
Oh, thanks.

100
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:08,530
Be good to her.

101
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:10,740
I told you to be nice to her when you went there.

102
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,770
What?

103
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:14,510
At the pool. Why did you let Soo Ji hang around?

104
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,485
I sent Tae Hee there so that you two could get closer.

105
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:19,115
- Soo Ji? - Be good to her.

106
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,265
(Detective Kim)

107
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:30,125
Thank you. Enjoy.

108
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,840
He's looking for you. Si Hyun will be there.

109
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,245
Just take him back.

110
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,615
I don't care...

111
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:49,285
if he comes.

112
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:54,855
- Hey. - Hello.

113
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,420
I remembered what your girlfriend asked me...

114
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,755
and looked into it.

115
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,420
There was only one accident...

116
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:03,765
in Jeongeup area on the day of your mom's accident.

117
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,135
It was a hit-and-run.

118
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:09,065
The victim was a high-school kid. It wasn't your mom.

119
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:10,705
I see.

120
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,460
You might be mistaken about your mom's accident,

121
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,345
or something else might be going on.

122
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,215
- Something else? - We wouldn't know.

123
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,385
Your family is very well-off. I was shocked.

124
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:24,310
Okay. Thank you.

125
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:25,455
(Criminal Affairs)

126
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,185
Mom, hurry up.

127
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:27,985
You're so pretty,

128
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:29,685
Tae Hee.

129
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:47,905
What?

130
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,835
- I came to get coffee. - You don't drink coffee.

131
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:56,045
- Let's eat after work. - I eat before I get off.

132
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:59,300
Let's go to an amusement park. It's open at night. And it's nearby.

133
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:00,915
I'm afraid of heights.

134
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:04,410
Let's go grocery shopping. Didn't you run out of food?

135
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:05,985
I order food online.

136
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,125
Right, that sounds easier.

137
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,795
You're too late.

138
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,950
- Right? - Look at how clean the screen is.

139
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,820
It's great.

140
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,820
- Let's see that show. - No, stop.

141
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,990
What's she been doing over there?

142
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:24,860
- Turn on the drama. - No, forget it.

143
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,035
Who is it?

144
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:28,605
(You have one missed call.)

145
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:33,885
Hello?

146
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:38,285
Father, this is Si Hyun.

147
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,085
- What a busy guy. - Yes.

148
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:44,050
I miss her too.

149
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:46,525
Yes, we'll be there together.

150
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,095
Thanks. Why did you bring it yourself?

151
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:56,265
Tae Hee.

152
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,830
If you have time, do you want to go visit...

153
00:09:58,835 --> 00:09:59,975
Tae Hee.

154
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,875
- Ki Young. - What?

155
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:06,215
What brings you here?

156
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,455
Can you keep working during the school year?

157
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,485
Architecture students have a lot of homework.

158
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,725
I'll make it work.

159
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,985
It's fun so far.

160
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:19,725
I'm just sad...

161
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:22,795
to see you doing such menial work.

162
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,965
Come on.

163
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,560
Don't say that.

164
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:28,905
Who is he to say that this is menial?

165
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,905
Do you want to work at my law firm?

166
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:36,605
You can organize records and case files.

167
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,170
You can do it on the weekends.

168
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,170
I'd be more than glad to.

169
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:42,470
Can I really come in just on the weekends?

170
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:43,615
Of course.

171
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,085
Do you want to go say hi as an interview?

172
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,455
Really?

173
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:49,450
I get paid for meals on the weekends too, right?

174
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,625
And you will guarantee the minimum wage, of course.

175
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:54,865
What do you think of me? Minimum wage?

176
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:55,990
Of course.

177
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,335
Does he even know what the minimum wage is?

178
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,335
One second.

179
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,370
- Do you know the minimum wage? - Me?

180
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:10,940
Either join the conversation, or stay out of it.

181
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,170
Make yourself clear.

182
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,910
I would prefer that you stayed out.

183
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,845
Let him do what he wants. It's not like we're strangers.

184
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:21,185
Si Hyun, when is your parents' wedding?

185
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,955
Is Soo Ji doing well?

186
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,155
Why do you ask me? Ask her yourself.

187
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:27,995
Is it weird for me to ask how your sister is doing?

188
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,665
I texted her a few times, but she won't answer.

189
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,495
Is she still sulking?

190
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:35,805
She probably didn't want to talk to you. That's why.

191
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:37,975
And...

192
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,440
you shouldn't belittle Soo Ji's feelings...

193
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,915
to a simple word like "sulking".

194
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:52,580
Are you almost finished? Let's go. Go get changed.

195
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,680
- Why would I go with you? - We live next door.

196
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:55,680
Next door?

197
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:56,785
- No. - Yes.

198
00:11:57,853 --> 00:11:59,855
What's your relationship?

199
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,225
He's a friend of a friend.

200
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:04,720
We just got to know each other.

201
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:05,920
Just got to know?

202
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:08,590
Hey, we're much more than that.

203
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:11,630
Give me 10 minutes. I want to visit your office.

204
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:12,775
Sure.

205
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:14,745
Tae Hee.

206
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,015
See you around.

207
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:21,210
I told you. She's cold-hearted.

208
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,940
- Goodness, look at her. - Thank you for coming back.

209
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:24,980
What a brat.

210
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:26,115
Grandma.

211
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:28,380
- Goodness. - You deserved that.

212
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,510
- Go. - Slap her.

213
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,020
Welcome.

214
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:34,265
You're wearing black again.

215
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,390
You're here. Isn't it cold?

216
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:39,065
Grandma, I missed you.

217
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:43,265
You got a new TV. It's great.

218
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,035
- What was that place? - Myoungjeong.

219
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:48,405
Yes, they decided to support us.

220
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,245
The director there is a great person.

221
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:54,415
Goodness, you must've been completely heartbroken.

222
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,245
We had no idea.

223
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,450
Did you fight with Tae Hee?

224
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,265
Why are you here alone?

225
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:16,665
I don't know. She seems upset about something.

226
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,575
My brother, ask her to buy you a meal.

227
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,615
- What? - That's the point.

228
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:31,815
Don't offer to buy a meal. Ask her to buy you one.

229
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:33,680
It's easier to get shot down...

230
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:36,725
if you offer to buy a meal for someone.

231
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,425
But if you ask them to buy,

232
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,590
they're more like to give in. That's what women are like.

233
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,720
- Of course. - He knows everything.

234
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,060
No.

235
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:49,965
Tae Hee is angry at him about something,

236
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,600
so he should buy her a meal.

237
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,330
- Right. - You're right.

238
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,170
Take this.

239
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:58,340
It's okay. I have pocket money.

240
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm fine.

241
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,610
- No, take this too. - Let's help him out.

242
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,080
- Take this. - Take it.

243
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
- I'm really fine. - Go eat with Tae Hee.

244
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:08,085
- Go home. - Yes.

245
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:15,295
Do you do interviews at such a nice place?

246
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:16,795
It's just for you.

247
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,065
Let's eat before we talk.

248
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:24,235
When will the others get here?

249
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:26,900
Am I going to see them at your office after dinner?

250
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,005
Actually,

251
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:31,315
it was a joke because I wanted to take you out.

252
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:33,370
You probably weren't going to come...

253
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,115
if I asked you out on a dinner.

254
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,815
So...

255
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,010
this isn't an interview for a part-time job?

256
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,955
Did you really fall for that?

257
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:46,655
I thought you followed me because you were annoyed by Si Hyun.

258
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,990
I'm sorry if I offended you.

259
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:58,035
Please let it pass.

260
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,730
I wanted to treat you to a nice dinner.

261
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,970
Of course, I'm offended. And I don't want your apology.

262
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:07,100
If you want to apologize, just apologize...

263
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,885
without saying, "if I offended you".

264
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,285
I'm only showing you respect because you were my dad's student.

265
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:19,595
- Tae Hee. - Sit down.

266
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:21,795
Okay.

267
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:28,265
- I'll pay for one. - Sure.

268
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,485
I should date someone like her.

269
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:45,755
Yes.

270
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,785
Tae Hee has the best mindset.

271
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:51,525
I spent half my living expenses.

272
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:54,595
That was enough to buy multiple bags of groceries.

273
00:15:58,894 --> 00:15:59,965
Darn it.

274
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:03,835
What's wrong with me today?

275
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:08,045
Kyung Joo, I'll call you back later.

276
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:19,340
- My ball... - What should we do?

277
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:20,885
- It's okay. - What now?

278
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:23,780
- Wow. - She's awesome.

279
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,280
- Keep going. - She's so cool.

280
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:27,350
- That's fascinating. - I want to climb too.

281
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,590
Shall I go up?

282
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:29,695
Kids.

283
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,320
What do you want, Si Hyun?

284
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:35,865
There are times when you should use your brain, not your brawn.

285
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:37,635
Who is he?

286
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,035
Give me that.

287
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:42,605
Tae Hee, hold on tight.

288
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,200
That was cool.

289
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,510
- That's way cool. - Awesome.

290
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,610
That was awesome.

291
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:51,910
Go on home now.

292
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:53,355
Your parents will be worried.

293
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:55,285
- Thank you. - Thank you.

294
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:58,525
Will you stay up there?

295
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,725
Will you come down...

296
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,795
and eat with me, please?

297
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,165
Is something the matter?

298
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,645
- Come on. - Move so I can jump.

299
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,215
Oh, okay.

300
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:32,855
- Put me down. - Okay.

301
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:36,995
Let's go.

302
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:42,460
I have to eat all this?

303
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:43,565
Of course.

304
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:46,600
You climbed so high when you're afraid of heights.

305
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:47,945
You need to eat.

306
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,815
Hey, there are drawings.

307
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:57,385
Can I have a look?

308
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:59,415
No one's seen them before.

309
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,425
- Really? - Yes.

310
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,650
What did you draw?

311
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,555
This and that, things I like.

312
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,365
Don't expect too much.

313
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:13,365
Will you draw me one day?

314
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,335
No. I'm not that good.

315
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,715
This is amazing.

316
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,755
It's his mom.

317
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,995
How much...

318
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,865
did you like him?

319
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,235
So much that...

320
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,935
our parents should never find out.

321
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:24,535
That was...

322
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,135
such a stupid question.

323
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,415
(Dad)

324
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,865
I need to talk to my dad.

325
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,665
Okay. Sure.

326
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:20,725
Dad.

327
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,895
Look. This is the bathroom.

328
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:27,765
And...

329
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:31,735
this is my bed.

330
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:34,945
And...

331
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:38,745
this is my desk.

332
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,915
It's really nice.

333
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:44,385
I feel more at ease now.

334
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:47,485
See? There's nothing to worry about.

335
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,685
Oh, Mom's good too.

336
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,195
How is her exhibition going?

337
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:56,395
You knew about that? Are you in touch?

338
00:20:57,993 --> 00:21:00,290
No, not really.

339
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:01,665
Did you google her?

340
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:03,265
What for?

341
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:07,435
Just because I was pleased to hear she's working again.

342
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,905
And I wanted to support her.

343
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:13,475
I'll send this via airmail. Give it to her.

344
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,715
Don't tell her it's from me.

345
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:17,885
Tae Hee.

346
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,555
Your mom loves my coffee blend.

347
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,325
Dad, that's all.

348
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,020
It's just your coffee...

349
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,795
that Mom likes.

350
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:35,565
She thoroughly used you to get over her broken heart.

351
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:38,960
That's why she had me. Did you forget about that?

352
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,075
She was still by my side.

353
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,700
Why miss her when it was just her empty shell?

354
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:45,115
Why just you?

355
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,845
You're the only one with a shattered heart.

356
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,915
Your insides are practically shriveled.

357
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,515
You told her that...

358
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:55,885
it's okay because you liked her.

359
00:21:57,286 --> 00:22:00,025
That you didn't mind. That you'd wait for her reply.

360
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,995
Did she ever reply?

361
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,495
She never did.

362
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:12,335
It's okay. You can take your time.

363
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:15,375
I think...

364
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:19,715
I already like you.

365
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:43,865
I deserve full marks.

366
00:23:32,748 --> 00:23:35,185
- Tae Hee, I... - I want to stop.

367
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:38,855
What do you mean?

368
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:40,895
It's too hard.

369
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,565
When we went to your villa, I hoped...

370
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:49,965
I could become a friend like Soo Ji and Se Joo.

371
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,575
That can never happen.

372
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,805
We met too late.

373
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:00,175
But that's not the hard part.

374
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,485
I don't want to be...

375
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,955
the kind of friend Soo Ji and Se Joo are to you.

376
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,165
I wanted to be...

377
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,665
your girlfriend.

378
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,735
You asked if I'd regret it.

379
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,635
I do regret it.

380
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,445
Going to the villa...

381
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,675
and staying behind when I wanted to leave.

382
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,270
Being happy to see you...

383
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:37,045
and telling you I liked you. I regret everything.

384
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:40,985
You're not pretending to be mean.

385
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,285
You just don't like me.

386
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:47,555
I was mistaken.

387
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:49,095
No.

388
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:58,435
I want to take photos of you. Why don't you?

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,875
Why won't you hold my hand first?

390
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,075
Why make me wonder if...

391
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:05,575
our first kiss was a dream?

392
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:10,245
Why do you rush over when Soo Ji calls and forget plans we made?

393
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:14,515
Why do you make me ask such questions?

394
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:24,165
See?

395
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,035
You're being very vague right now too.

396
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:29,565
What did...

397
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:31,635
Soo Ji say to you?

398
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:35,975
I don't like guys that seem strange.

399
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,775
And I don't have crushes.

400
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:40,745
I am...

401
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,845
talking about you and me.

402
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,655
What Soo Ji said doesn't matter.

403
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:51,755
Go.

404
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,325
Let's go talk in my room.

405
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,625
Right.

406
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,365
This was your building.

407
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:04,735
Please leave.
