1
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:08,885
Should I tell you whom I just met?

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,255
(Episode 22)

3
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:13,955
Ms. Seol Young Won.

4
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,490
I wouldn't have gone this far...

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,295
had you two not gotten back together.

6
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:25,335
I didn't want to intervene in your life.

7
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:29,905
I didn't want to see the woman...

8
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,805
that I had imagined and despised my entire life.

9
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:35,305
What...

10
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:38,045
What have you done?

11
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,485
This is just unfair.

12
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:42,815
My mom...

13
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:48,355
lived her entire life in loneliness.

14
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,025
But the other woman...

15
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,655
had no idea...

16
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,265
and lived her life like a victim who lost her love.

17
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,565
Isn't that just unfair?

18
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,295
Why did you tell her?

19
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:05,135
Why did you tell Mom where she was?

20
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:07,130
What?

21
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:10,645
You just couldn't let go of anything.

22
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,900
Can you now fathom how many people...

23
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,585
became unhappy because of your selfishness?

24
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:16,755
I hope...

25
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,055
you will be...

26
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:21,455
tormented for a long time.

27
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:54,485
(Young Won)

28
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:07,730
All right, now.

29
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:11,505
When you take the square root of X to get A,

30
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:14,045
we say the square root of A is X.

31
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:16,305
I get it.

32
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,900
You have a knack for teaching.

33
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,145
Really?

34
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:23,340
But my slow understanding is the problem.

35
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:25,415
How am I going to memorize all these equations?

36
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:30,255
If you do the homework I give you and review everything,

37
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,925
you'll be fine. At first, it was really hard for me too.

38
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:42,835
Who is he?

39
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,905
Well...

40
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,270
He's my boyfriend.

41
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,245
Can you keep it a secret from my mom?

42
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:55,070
Is that why you wanted to study at a cafe?

43
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:58,115
In return, I'll study really hard.

44
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,750
Hello.

45
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:06,225
- Hello. - I'm Ryu Joo An.

46
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:10,090
I prepared something to help Hye Jeong study.

47
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,465
What? Just now?

48
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:15,330
The quadratic formula in quadratic equation is

49
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:18,860
B plus-minus root b squared

50
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:22,470
Minus 4ac over 2a

51
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:26,375
B squared minus 4ac is the equation

52
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:30,285
That was so original.

53
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,985
- Isn't it easy? - It is.

54
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:37,020
Tae Hee, did you ever have...

55
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,195
someone sing a song for you?

56
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,395
I'd rather be the singer.

57
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:49,360
I told Si Hyun to buy buttercream, but he got whipped cream.

58
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,130
You like whipped cream.

59
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:53,235
You'll eat it all anyway.

60
00:03:56,873 --> 00:04:00,015
Hey, that side is lower than the other.

61
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:02,940
It's not. It's leveled.

62
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,740
You do it every year, and you're useless.

63
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,610
Get down. I'll do it.

64
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:08,410
- I'll do it. - No, let me.

65
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,695
Leave it, please, let me.

66
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,965
Will the candles go out?

67
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,065
He's here.

68
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:27,000
Happy birthday to you

69
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:29,630
Happy birthday, dear Si Hyun

70
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,575
Happy birthday to you

71
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,815
Happy birthday.

72
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:37,515
Go on, blow them out.

73
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:44,395
Hey, why didn't you blow them out?

74
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,765
Soo Ji.

75
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:54,705
What did you say when you met my dad?

76
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,205
You saw his dad? Why?

77
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,445
I asked him to let us get married.

78
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,385
Why ask when you already know?

79
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:11,955
Why did you just go and say that?

80
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,250
Didn't you think about my situation?

81
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,525
How silly and stupid I'd look?

82
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:19,625
Don't you care about how I feel?

83
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:20,965
How you feel?

84
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,695
Why do you sound angry?

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,120
Our game and your goal from the beginning...

86
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,765
was to marry me.

87
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,705
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,275
What marriage?

89
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:37,740
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

90
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,075
But I don't understand your reaction.

91
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:43,510
I didn't get why you struggled when you ended it with Tae Hee.

92
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,510
Yes, you could've felt guilty,

93
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:48,255
and I know you liked her, but it's over.

94
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,320
You dumped her yourself because you're sick of her.

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,395
No.

96
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,525
That's not why we broke up.

97
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:57,565
I never...

98
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,905
disliked Tae Hee.

99
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:04,275
Did you...

100
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:08,905
fake the breakup to make me tell you about Seol Young Won?

101
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,515
Did you use me?

102
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:23,085
Tae Hee's car accident from two years ago.

103
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:27,525
My mom caused it.

104
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,265
That woman.

105
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:34,635
My mom hit Tae Hee while on her way to meet her.

106
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,705
The hit-and-run driver...

107
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:39,935
was my mom.

108
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,775
That's why we broke up.

109
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:48,085
Because I thought I'd go crazy.

110
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:57,025
Do you know what she said?

111
00:06:58,388 --> 00:06:59,695
She said...

112
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,965
I'd have suffered more than she did.

113
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:06,060
She comforted me, saying she's fine...

114
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,635
because she met me.

115
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:10,775
She has no idea how and why I approached her.

116
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,505
She doesn't know what kind of trash I am.

117
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:15,005
She said that.

118
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,515
You're confusing...

119
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,870
gratitude, guilt, and love.

120
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,645
All of the above.

121
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,315
We're the most important to you,

122
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:29,680
and you cared about nothing other than stopping the wedding.

123
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,320
Then you turned strange.

124
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,195
She was just a pawn. Why did you fall for her?

125
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,565
Could she ever...

126
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:38,835
mean more to you than us? Than me?

127
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:41,190
Soo Ji.

128
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:44,075
You must come back. What's wrong with you?

129
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,275
Are you against it?

130
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:50,815
Tell me if you're against...

131
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:54,645
marrying me to stop your dad from marrying my mom.

132
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,555
I am.

133
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,085
I'm against it.

134
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,965
Let's call off all the bets.

135
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,835
And stop all this.

136
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,405
I have no right to do this.

137
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,005
But you have no right to like her either.

138
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,645
Yes, you're right.

139
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:30,955
That's why I'm going to beg.

140
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:34,525
Until Tae Hee forgives me,

141
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,295
I will beg even after I die.

142
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,440
You're just terrible.

143
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,780
Must we take a sick leave to celebrate a birthday?

144
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:09,625
How can we stay in school and be gloomy on a birthday?

145
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,220
We have to send him home tonight.

146
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,525
- Or he'll end up like me. - Gosh.

147
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,190
Hurry up before the wax gets on the cake.

148
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:19,765
There are so many candles.

149
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,690
I'm glad we'll only have to light two big ones next year.

150
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:26,305
Are you complaining about this? Just light the candles.

151
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,005
Hurry.

152
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:30,540
Seriously?

153
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,200
Just do it inside. I can hear you squabbling.

154
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,515
Even so, you can't come out here.

155
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,755
Give me that.

156
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,655
There.

157
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:46,155
After we turn 20, let's light just three candles.

158
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:50,320
However old we are, 1 each for the 3 of us.

159
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:51,635
Lee Se Joo,

160
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:52,920
Choi Soo Ji,

161
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:55,560
and Kwon Si Hyun. That's three.

162
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:59,475
You're being the cool one again.

163
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:03,170
- Are you crying? - Don't ask.

164
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:05,015
Don't be silly.

165
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:08,270
You jerk.

166
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:10,410
Blow out the candles.

167
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:11,915
Okay, okay.

168
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:26,995
You are mine. Heart.

169
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,030
A silly grin on the railroad.

170
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,135
My boyfriend's photoshoot.

171
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,375
Si Hyun's breakfast.

172
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,765
My wish...

173
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:00,905
came true.

174
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,675
Did I make too much?

175
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,905
Right, seaweed soup.

176
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,755
(100g, 40 portions)

177
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,755
You and Si Hyun plotting to prevent your mom...

178
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:27,125
from marrying his dad.

179
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:30,295
The loser goes on a hunger strike and gives up their car.

180
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,035
You weren't just going to register your marriage,

181
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,730
and I was in the middle having fun.

182
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:37,875
Sorry...

183
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,060
that we didn't tell you.

184
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,145
It's fine.

185
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:43,300
I suspected as much...

186
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,145
because I know how much you care for him.

187
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,385
But Soo Ji.

188
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,785
He doesn't feel the same.

189
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,885
You know that now.

190
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:58,680
Instead of plotting this stupid game,

191
00:11:58,688 --> 00:11:59,895
you should've just...

192
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:03,265
liked Si Hyun outright.

193
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,765
What were you scared of?

194
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,030
Aren't you the same?

195
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,435
Too scared of something to admit the truth?

196
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:16,905
You're right.

197
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:20,375
I'm the stupidest 1 of the 3.

198
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,645
Silly me.

199
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:24,915
I should've stopped you.

200
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:28,855
I should've stopped you when I'd noticed things were off.

201
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,650
Why was I so stupid?

202
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:35,165
Why did I just grin as if I knew nothing?

203
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:40,905
Soo Ji.

204
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,405
Don't become an idiot like me.

205
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,005
Stop while you can.

206
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,505
If you want to get him back,

207
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:49,845
tell him how you really feel.

208
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:51,915
What you want is Si Hyun.

209
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:55,485
Why do you keep doing things to lose him?

210
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,145
Why?

211
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,885
He's changed so much. How can I tell him?

212
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:04,995
You might as well just blame me.

213
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,235
Hi.

214
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:54,375
Why am I continuously reminded of that time?

215
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,545
What are you doing?

216
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:00,885
Welcome home.

217
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:04,355
Why were you waiting outside in the cold?

218
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:07,155
I wanted to see you quickly.

219
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,385
Hey, wait.

220
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:11,395
Thanks.

221
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,425
Do you know this?

222
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,765
Flower petals fall down with the wind, right?

223
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,175
If you catch one in your hand,

224
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:27,475
your love comes true.

225
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,845
Really? Who said that?

226
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,145
My dad.

227
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,885
He read it in a book too.

228
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,580
But what's important is...

229
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,955
that you should not try to catch a petal.

230
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,055
A petal has to fall down...

231
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,795
and land on your palm.

232
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,495
So it means I should wait...

233
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,635
instead of trying to catch one.

234
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,405
Is that it?

235
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:56,605
Because love is...

236
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,035
something you can't catch or hold onto?

237
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,715
I've always seen my dad standing like this during spring.

238
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:08,915
I guess he was...

239
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:13,055
waiting for a petal to fall down into his hand...

240
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,255
while thinking about my mom.

241
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,655
Whom was my mom waiting for?

242
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,425
I try not to be curious,

243
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,535
but I sometimes wonder...

244
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:27,805
who my real dad is.

245
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,905
I wonder if my mom loved my dad at all.

246
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,735
In my memory,

247
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:36,605
my mom was someone who'd even love him alone.

248
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:39,145
That's why she was so lonely.

249
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,885
I guess the petals won't fall...

250
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:48,385
into my hand.

251
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:57,895
Let's go home.

252
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:01,865
I love hearing "Let's go home."

253
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:04,005
- Right? - Yes.

254
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,905
I'm like home to you, right?

255
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,275
Of course.

256
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,970
You're like a real home to me too.

257
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:12,645
- Really? - Yes.

258
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,345
Because you are...

259
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:16,915
my landlord.

260
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:21,185
Let's go.

261
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:23,355
Let's go home!

262
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,905
Just one more day.

263
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,145
I want to be happy for just another day.

264
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,495
How long will you avoid me?

265
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,095
I'm tired.

266
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:08,105
I heard you wanted to marry Si Hyun.

267
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,475
How could you say that? What does that make me?

268
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,475
You told me to try.

269
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,945
You told me to try to become the lady of JK Group or whatever.

270
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,685
No.

271
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:25,115
You and Si Hyun cannot be together.

272
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,425
Si Hyun is...

273
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:31,325
not Seok Woo's real son.

274
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,225
What?

275
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:35,825
It's true.

276
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:40,060
Does Si Hyun know? Did Mr. Kwon tell you?

277
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,260
That's not important.

278
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,760
How is that not important? That means Si Hyun has no one.

279
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,805
If you're that worried about him,

280
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,245
you need to take my side.

281
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:50,445
I'll protect him.

282
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,645
What do you mean?

283
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,485
Are you going to kick him out...

284
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,585
if I don't behave?

285
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,785
Mom, please.

286
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:04,625
They aren't yours.

287
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:07,865
His heart and his company were never meant to be yours.

288
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,560
You said you were protecting the hospital,

289
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:16,105
not abandoning Dad for his failed business.

290
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,405
Because the hospital was the only thing you had.

291
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:22,245
I'm trying very hard to understand you.

292
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,415
So please do this one last favor for me.

293
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,895
You got kicked out, right?

294
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:40,395
Did you really get abandoned?

295
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,125
Does he want to cut you off on papers too?

296
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:46,835
Why do you say these things as if you aren't going to be there?

297
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:50,405
Did you move out for good?

298
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,135
What's happening between you and Mr. Kwon?

299
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,475
Can you not tell us?

300
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,015
Well, later.

301
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,915
You'll find out later.

302
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:03,685
Kwon Si Hyun.

303
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,085
You should've told us.

304
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,395
We had no idea.

305
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:15,595
Didn't you think about my situation?

306
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:17,965
How silly and stupid I'd look?

307
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,965
Don't you care about how I feel?

308
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:23,905
We had no idea that you had no one.

309
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,710
Se Joo, Si Hyun is...

310
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:38,815
What?

311
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,415
What is it?

312
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:44,425
We have to go find Si Hyun. Come quickly.

313
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,235
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you

314
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:59,030
Happy birthday, dear Si Hyun

315
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,375
Happy birthday to you

316
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:08,815
What's wrong? Are you crying?

317
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:11,485
Are you that touched?

318
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:13,680
How did you know it was my birthday?

319
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:14,850
You fool.

320
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,855
We talked about our birthdays when we watched the constellations.

321
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:19,555
Oh, right.

322
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:21,795
Make a wish.

323
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,195
Okay.

324
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,195
Wait.

325
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,565
Can I have one?

326
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,705
Okay, sure.

327
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:36,475
I wish Si Hyun will be healthy and happy.

328
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:43,145
I wish my son will always be healthy and happy.

329
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:46,880
What kind of a wish is that?

330
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:47,955
Then what?

331
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,825
What else could I wish for?

332
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,395
What kind of a wish is that?

333
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:55,990
What else then?

334
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:59,165
You're rich, and you don't care about studying.

335
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:01,965
Do you have a wish?

336
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:06,000
The wish I made on my last birthday came true.

337
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,605
- What was it? - It's a secret.

338
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:13,645
I want to prepare a surprise for your birthday too.

339
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,385
Oh, my birthday will be...

340
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:18,185
in just nine months.

341
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:21,725
Where did you come from?

342
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:23,825
I was born...

343
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,225
to celebrate your birthday with you.

344
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,935
I'm sorry. I'm bad at these things.

345
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:38,735
It would've been better if we met a little earlier.

346
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:42,175
Hey, when we met isn't important.

347
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:45,915
What's important is how we've met and how we'll stay together.

348
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,345
- Right? - Yes.

349
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:49,585
Make your wish.

350
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:52,055
- My wish is... - Wait.

351
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,455
You have to keep it a secret for it to come true.

352
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,325
Okay.

353
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,830
- What's that? - It's your present.

354
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,075
- You got me a present too? - Yes.

355
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,110
It's as if this is the first time you got a birthday present.

356
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:24,510
You look so happy.

357
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,755
It's my first time getting it from my girlfriend.

358
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,725
- Open it. - Okay.

359
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:31,725
My gosh.

360
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:35,995
What is this?

361
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:45,735
"From your girlfriend who wants to be a great joy to you."

362
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:50,675
"Tae Hee".

363
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:53,915
It means "great joy".

364
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:56,110
"Great joy".

365
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,955
That's an awesome name.

366
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:01,485
What does yours mean?

367
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,655
Si...

368
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:06,895
It means...

369
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:11,250
In order to enlighten his students, Buddha...

370
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:14,730
appears to them in various shapes and forms...

371
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,635
That's what my mom said, but I have no idea.

372
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,835
That's a nice name.

373
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,170
Did she want you to change...

374
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:26,145
until you found your true shape and color?

375
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:27,815
I don't know.

376
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:31,380
I made that myself.

377
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,155
- Really? - Yes.

378
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:38,795
You said you didn't remember my smile.

379
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:40,595
Now, you can look at that.

380
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:42,890
I'll never forget...

381
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,065
my great joy's smile.

382
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:13,150
"From your girlfriend, Tae Hee,"

383
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,825
"who wants to be a great joy to you."

384
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:22,230
(On a sunny day, Tae Hee and Si Hyun)

385
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,760
(Travel to nice and pretty places,)

386
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,375
(and fill in the rest of the spaces.)

387
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:46,555
(My hidden joy)

388
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,935
(To Tae Hee)

389
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,645
I thought it was my last chance...

390
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,845
to leave you.

391
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:12,785
Am I allowed to receive such a smile from you?

392
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:19,155
To earn the minimum right to love you,

393
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:23,395
I must tell you everything.

394
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:25,565
I've made up my mind.

395
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:31,675
Don't let Tae Hee forgive me.

396
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,135
Give me...

397
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,145
a very great...

398
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:37,805
punishment.

399
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,815
(Tempted)

400
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:14,470
Let's remember how we're both sinners.

401
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:17,615
That's our punishment.

402
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:20,310
That woman is your mom.

403
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:21,850
Did you hear that?

404
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,820
Si Hyun's mom died two years ago...

405
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,850
on her way to visit your mom.

406
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:28,820
Did you know everything?

407
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:32,020
Did you tell me, knowing that she's Tae Hee's mom?

408
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,135
Yes.

409
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:34,935
There's no sort of...

410
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,405
friendship between us now.
