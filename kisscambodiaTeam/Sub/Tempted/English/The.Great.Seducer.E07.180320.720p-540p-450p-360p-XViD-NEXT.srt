1
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:08,245
Don't you...

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,082
want to find out?

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,919
I do want to,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,355
but I'm afraid.

5
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,060
Me too.

6
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:26,896
I'm afraid.

7
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:29,833
Why?

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,804
In case...

9
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:40,610
I'll do you wrong.

10
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:45,248
How can you do me wrong?

11
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:47,684
Lying.

12
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:49,185
What?

13
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,590
I mean, deceiving people.

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,226
People pretend that they like you and are nice.

15
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:59,262
The world is filled with that kind of people, so be careful.

16
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:02,599
But don't you think...

17
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,069
deceiving yourself is the worst?

18
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,004
Pretending that you're not hurt...

19
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,674
or lonely and that everything is okay.

20
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,243
Someone I know used to do that.

21
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:15,078
And the false pretense...

22
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,280
caused the heart to fall sick.

23
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,151
Then you should tell me.

24
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:23,320
Don't disregard your feelings.

25
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:25,422
You haven't given me your answer...

26
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:29,125
about how you feel about me.

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,433
I'll wait for your answer.

28
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:43,273
Is this the one I drew?

29
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,542
My gosh, the final product looks completely different.

30
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:49,879
I baked it after glazing it. Isn't it beautiful?

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,748
Not as beautiful as you.

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,022
But where did you learn to bake pottery?

33
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:00,490
This is so interesting.

34
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:03,093
I just learned a few things here and there.

35
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,794
Oh, right.

36
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:08,164
Give this to the old lady. I'm sure she'll like it.

37
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,967
I should wrap it up then.

38
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:13,069
To make it look as beautiful as you.

39
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,407
Hey, on second thought, I will wrap it up.

40
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,042
Why? I want to wrap it up for her.

41
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,777
I always wanted to try it.

42
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:23,079
No, no. I think it's better that I do it.

43
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,414
- Why? - I said I'll do it.

44
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:25,782
- You told me to give this to her. - No, I said I can do it.

45
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,751
They are going to stay the whole night with that plate.

46
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,185
You said they had a fight.

47
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:31,221
It looks like they are about to get very cozy.

48
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:34,491
Hey, you two. Shouldn't you be going home? We need to sleep.

49
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,060
- We were just leaving. - Okay.

50
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,528
Come on, don't be so mean.

51
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,897
Why do these youngsters need to go home?

52
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,065
We're going now.

53
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:45,802
- Bye. - Have fun, and go home late.

54
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:48,171
- Hey. - What?

55
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,374
But why are we running? Why?

56
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,412
I have a part-time job.

57
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:56,946
I'm going to be late.

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,281
When does your shift end?

59
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:02,652
The ladies told us to go home as late as we could.

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,156
I get off very late.

61
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:10,093
Then I'll wait for you and drop you off at home.

62
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,395
It's dangerous at night.

63
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,733
I think you might be more dangerous.

64
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:19,836
Why are your cheeks so red?

65
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,740
Are you coming down with a cold?

66
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,512
Hey, you have a fever.

67
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,848
Your scarf came loose too.

68
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:33,249
Why am I letting him do this?

69
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:34,951
- Give me your boss' phone number. - Get yourself together.

70
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,719
Let's get you out of work and head to the hospital together.

71
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,657
- Should I carry you on my back? - Hey.

72
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,231
It's because I'm hot.

73
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,966
I easily get hot.

74
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:51,768
I'm going now.

75
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:55,905
Wait for me.

76
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,340
What's gotten into him?

77
00:03:57,507 --> 00:03:59,175
Grab a bite with me today.

78
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,945
Why are my cheeks so hot?

79
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,280
- Eun Tae Hee! - This is crazy.

80
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,194
I'm sorry that I'm late.

81
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:19,963
Please sit down.

82
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:29,839
Surprisingly, I was very happy with the team we have for bio business.

83
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,109
We just need to reassign some people in Research and Development.

84
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:34,410
Do you mind if I supervise that?

85
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:35,645
I'll leave that to you.

86
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,780
Tell me if you need my help.

87
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:42,385
In 2020, this bio business will be JK's focus. You can count on that.

88
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:43,720
I'd be grateful.

89
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,389
Oh, what about the new business proposal?

90
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,757
Why did you invite me to dinner?

91
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,528
I'm confused if this is a meeting or a date.

92
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,031
Don't interrupt when adults are discussing.

93
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm sorry. This is a family dinner,

94
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,270
but we only talked shop tonight.

95
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:02,805
"A family dinner".

96
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,210
Should I tell you something that would be good for our family dinner?

97
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,613
- Sure. What is it? - Even if you get married,

98
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,116
don't get rid of your current house.

99
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:20,156
- That's none of your business. - I'm aware of that.

100
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:22,458
This is neither your nor my place to butt in.

101
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,665
To Si Hyun, that house is an extension of his mother.

102
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,600
It's the house he shared with his sick mother.

103
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,336
He always stayed there to ensure it wouldn't feel strange to her...

104
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,671
when she came back from the hospital.

105
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:37,707
I believe he's grown up now and that it's time for him to accept it.

106
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:39,742
How could he accept that she's gone? He's never gotten a closure.

107
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:40,877
Choi Soo Ji.

108
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,378
When she passed away,

109
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,648
you didn't even allow Si Hyun to attend her funeral.

110
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,618
If he's collapsed, why didn't they take him to a hospital?

111
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:51,621
How awful of them.

112
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,492
Si Hyun.

113
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,298
Hey, you're here.

114
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:09,339
Mom, the kids are here.

115
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,342
Mom.

116
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,712
Why isn't she answering?

117
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:19,215
Look at us.

118
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:34,330
She's not here.

119
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,102
My mom...

120
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:40,837
is not here.

121
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,780
It's okay to cry.

122
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,483
We're here with you.

123
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:04,794
I understand how Si Hyun feels.

124
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,131
If you want to take away what he has left,

125
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:12,101
you can at least give him some time to reminisce over her.

126
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,071
Okay. I will think about...

127
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,306
moving into the new house.

128
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,578
I thought this was a family meeting,

129
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:24,914
but you are both not curious about why Si Hyun isn't here.

130
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,386
Please make sure you do what I asked of you.

131
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:34,424
I won't ask why you got here so late...

132
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,426
if you were at the hotel already.

133
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:52,875
Hey.

134
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:54,644
What do you think?

135
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:57,280
Pretty. You look pretty no matter what you put on.

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,149
Are you supposed to feel this good...

137
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,552
when someone says that you are pretty?

138
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,421
What's with these watery eyes?

139
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:07,123
And what's with that lovely voice?

140
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,357
Who said that to you?

141
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,660
Oh, no one.

142
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,296
It's Si Hyun, isn't it?

143
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,399
Do you think he could tell that my heart dropped?

144
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,234
You need to get a hold of yourself.

145
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,836
If your heart drops at the smallest things,

146
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:22,305
it'll become your fast track in becoming the underdog in dating.

147
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,307
I'm not going to date him.

148
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,275
I'm just a bit confused.

149
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,211
This is huge.

150
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,880
Tae Hee finally has a crush on a guy.

151
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,582
It's not like that.

152
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,250
This shows that you have a crush on him.

153
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,486
You keep having him on your mind.

154
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,055
Soo Ji.

155
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,958
- Soo Ji. - Stop.

156
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,040
Flowers.

157
00:08:58,274 --> 00:08:59,475
What is this?

158
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:02,712
How was it?

159
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,547
Your dad was late.

160
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,150
- Almost an hour. - He's always like that.

161
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:11,187
He didn't look for you. I thought he'd ask me.

162
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:15,458
Are you really abandoned? Is he going to disown you legally?

163
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,029
Stop. I came around for you on a Friday night.

164
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,072
Choi Soo Ji.

165
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,941
What are you going to do?

166
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,277
Stay still.

167
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:37,246
What if he is just playing around with you?

168
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,749
Don't worry. I'll ask without making it obvious.

169
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,651
Hey, stop it.

170
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:44,720
Gosh.

171
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,861
Have you talked to Si Hyun about Tae Hee?

172
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:54,530
It seemed like they've been seeing each other. What does he say?

173
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,237
I'm with him right now. I'll ask.

174
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,105
She's with him right now.

175
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:05,241
Oh, really?

176
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,579
He said he ran into her when he was volunteering.

177
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,148
So does he like her? Did he say she's pretty?

178
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:13,916
He says I'm prettier.

179
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,619
Hey, stop joking around.

180
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:18,988
No idea. We're busy partying.

181
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:20,656
I'll ask him later.

182
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:25,595
It looks like he's busy partying with everyone.

183
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,732
I thought he went home.

184
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:35,504
What is it?

185
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,340
What did she say?

186
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,543
I don't think he's particularly interested.

187
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,547
- I'm sorry. - It's all for the better.

188
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:49,151
It was a waste of time to be interested in him for a second.

189
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,422
Are you disappointed?

190
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:56,859
A bit.

191
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,597
I've been living here ever since I moved to Seoul.

192
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:02,765
Of course, I'm disappointed.

193
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,101
Stop changing the subject.

194
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,937
Whatever. Go to sleep.

195
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:20,416
Hey, your acting was unbelievable.

196
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,518
- You have a call. - Don't pick up.

197
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,122
What did you say again?

198
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,524
Hello, Ms. Myung. This is Si Hyun.

199
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:29,892
Hey, Si Hyun.

200
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:32,561
Are you two together?

201
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,764
Yes, Se Joo's here also.

202
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:38,000
It's rather late. Is this something important?

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,469
No, I'm sorry. We'll be home soon.

204
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,771
Don't be sorry.

205
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:43,673
Si Hyun.

206
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:47,376
You must've been disappointed about how we might be moving.

207
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,578
No, it's up to you two.

208
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:52,815
We realized we made a mistake only after Soo Ji brought up...

209
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:54,050
how you felt.

210
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,553
We didn't make any decisions yet, so don't worry about it. Okay?

211
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,055
Okay.

212
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,157
You should go home. Your dad will be worried.

213
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,392
I said, "This is popular in Korea."

214
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,962
"You can't get this every single day."

215
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,164
Hey, try doing it again.

216
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:11,600
- All right, so... - Let's go home. Your mom's worried.

217
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,835
Why did you pick up?

218
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:15,137
He's going to show us something.

219
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,407
- What was that? - Hey.

220
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,578
You broke it.

221
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,047
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one. Where did you get it?

222
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:27,183
Why can't you be more careful?

223
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:29,752
Things like this happen.

224
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:32,288
Are you angry at me over some dish?

225
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:34,156
I didn't buy it. It's handmade.

226
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:36,325
Let's see if we can fix that.

227
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:38,327
Did you make it?

228
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:39,962
- Did you draw this? - No, give it back.

229
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,931
What is it? Whom did you make it for?

230
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,399
That's not it.

231
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,305
It's not like I did that on purpose.

232
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,808
I would've rather died than sit in that dinner if I had a choice.

233
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:54,243
Darn it.

234
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,312
It's not that. I was surprised...

235
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:58,647
That was the first time you were that angry at me.

236
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,784
I'm so sorry, okay?

237
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,127
Hey, what was that huge fuss about?

238
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,228
Soo Ji.

239
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,430
You can't leave by yourself.

240
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,430
First floor.

241
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:55,905
Soo Ji!

(Eun Myung Ryeol, Seol Young Won)

244
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:32,374
Why were you drawn to pottery?

245
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,244
I don't remember.

246
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:38,180
It's like how you can't exactly recall...

247
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,615
what you liked about your significant other.

248
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,485
You just fall for it.

249
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:44,653
It's kind of like love.

250
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:47,690
Potteries are very cold when you touch it, right?

251
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,724
Yes.

252
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:50,526
Should I say that it's gotten colder?

253
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:53,496
But at first, it was burning hot.

254
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:55,698
And you are so careful with it while you make one.

255
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,000
They become solid as you go through these things.

256
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,370
It can last forever as long as you don't break it.

257
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:05,241
I was a bit nervous to hold an exhibition after a long time,

258
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,743
but thoughts like these are what helped me through this.

259
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,781
- Please excuse me. - Sure.

260
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm sorry to bother you while you're enjoying this.

261
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:20,289
We were being too loud.

262
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,492
You can take your time and look around.

263
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:34,170
Why is she eating something every two hours like an infant?

264
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:38,374
- Take it. - Thank you.

265
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,814
- Yes, Ms. Jo. - Hi, where are you?

266
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,082
Where are you?

267
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,251
You said you went to an exhibition,

268
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,253
but I think you're in the wrong area for that.

269
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:55,257
We came over here for a really short while to get snacks.

270
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:58,561
Did you? I got worried because you were in a weird neighborhood.

271
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:02,698
Hye Jeong's very weak and catches a cold easily.

272
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:05,834
She has a lot of studying to do, so don't waste her time.

273
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,070
Of course not, don't worry.

274
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,272
Sure, bye.

275
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:21,016
How does she know where we are?

276
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:22,218
Well...

277
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,420
She downloaded this.

279
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:31,760
Hey, are there security cameras in your room?

280
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,330
There used to be one, but my brother kept taking peeks,

281
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,898
so she took them out when I was 15.

282
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:38,000
Hye Jeong.

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,536
Don't worry. I'll show you a real good time.

284
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:43,205
Soo Ji, thank you so much.

285
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:46,609
Hey, if you want us to be friends,

286
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,944
stop bowing to me from now on.

287
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:51,880
Where did you learn that when you don't even go to school?

288
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:53,749
From teen-dramas.

289
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,184
Don't do that.

290
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,519
I'm not a bully or your senior.

291
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,821

292
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:00,756
I'll remember that.

293
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,293
That was a mistake. Sorry, sorry.

294
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:07,229
You're all grown up, but you're just like a kid.

295
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:15,738
I can do this.

296
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,178
I give up. Who cares?

297
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,082
I care.

Darn it.

00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,458
He's not very interested.

302
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:03,479
I'll do it.

303
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:05,314
I'm done.

304
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,417

Shall I give it to you two?

312
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:37,946
- Give it to them, then. - Go on.

313
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:40,983
Gosh. Whose is this?

314
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,251
That's mine.

315
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:44,620
Ms. Choi Young Soon.

316

319
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:51,627
Me too.

00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,663

- What's wrong? - What?

00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,252
They're fighting?

327
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:22,191
Hey, why are you telling me that now?

328
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:25,928
I wanted to tell, but how could I when you wouldn't even look at me?

329
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:29,198
What's going on?

330
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:30,566
It's okay.

331
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,771
Granny, something went wrong while baking the plates.

332
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,940
I'll make you a new one, okay?

333

00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,378
They're gone?

335
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:46,415
They're...

336
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:48,650
I'll... Granny.

337
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,152
Granny.

338
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,054
How about a piggyback ride?

339
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:55,457
- What? - Hop on.

340
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,525
Okay.

341
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:58,527
Hold on tight.

342
00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,995
- Let's go. - Me too.

343
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:01,463
Me too.

344
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,031
Me too.

345
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,100
- Me too. - Me first.

346
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,669
It's my turn next.

347
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,273
Father, me too.

348
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:13,675
A piggyback ride?

349
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,196
Sorry. I dropped it by mistake.

350
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,831
It's fine.

351
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:47,376
Will you make another one?

352
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:50,178
Great idea. You focus on making that.

353
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,947
I'll do the cleaning up.

354
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,485
Stop fooling around.

355
00:21:57,553 --> 00:21:58,620
What?

356
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,557
If this place meant something, would you have done that?

357
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:04,092
"I broke the plate. What should I do?"

358
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:06,161
You could've called me, but you didn't.

359
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,763
If that's not fooling around, what is?

360
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,766
I'm sorry I didn't call ahead.

361
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,669
But couldn't you hear my story first?

362
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,870
Forget it.

363
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,373
I was a fool for trusting you with it.

364
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:24,580
The people here never ask volunteers...

365
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,381
to come back again.

366
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:30,152
They don't want to put pressure on those who visit.

367
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:32,921
You have no idea how much they crave company.

368
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,290
So stop what you're doing.

369
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:38,493
I don't want them to get hurt over your tomfoolery.

370
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:41,930
I get that.

371
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:45,901
Are you talking about yourself or the old ladies?

372
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:50,739
Sorry for fooling around.

373
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:23,572
Oh no...

374
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:38,086
This is a reminder that you must be present at breakfast in two days.

375
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,124
For the peace and happiness of our family.

376
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:47,562
It's not for anyone's happiness. It's so you can keep your head.

377
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,103
Climb down the rope with care.

378
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:57,539
If you were to get hurt,

379
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,208
your father would be so heartbroken.

380
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:04,079
Oh dear. You worry about all sorts of things.

381
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,549
I know very well that someone...

382
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,952
can get me kicked out without a penny.

383
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,554
I'll be very careful.

384
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:14,156
Good for you.

385
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:17,459
You should walk out on your own.

386
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:20,422
I never thought you'd show me what it's like to be a bachelor.

387
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:24,793
Is that breakfast?

388
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,363
Hey, I won't tell you to move back home.

389
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:31,066
They deliver all sorts of foods these days.

390
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:33,135
Do you think you'll be fit forever?

391
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:35,003
A diet like this...

392
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:37,072
will ruin your DNA.

393
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,608
Then your virility of all things...

394
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:41,343
will take a direct hit.

395
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:43,311
You just stop drinking.

396
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,413
Why talk about virility so early in the morning?

397
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,817
I'm very thankful to have a friend who thinks it's morning now.

398
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,686
Get your passport. Osaka has the best ramen.

399
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:59,227
Do you want to guess the information this almighty prince has?

400
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:01,363
This concerns Eun Tae Hee.

401
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,399
The one who spoke ill of you wasn't Ko Kyung Joo.

402
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:09,938
Why should I help you?

403
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,773
What do I get out of this?

404
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:15,177
Money?

405
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:19,714
Or a job that suits someone as beautiful as you?

406
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:22,551
It's a much better job than the one you have now.

407
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,186
Or...

408
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:30,292
me?

409
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,795
His evil intentions are beyond your imagination.

410
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:37,232
His hobby is seducing women to get into their pants.

411
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:38,433
Tell you what.

412
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:41,269
He recently had a fling with his schoolmate's mother...

413
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,437
at a club.

414
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:50,512
Since the mother used to be a model,

415
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:52,147
she looks younger than her age.

416
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:55,917
He uses that as his excuse to claim he didn't know she was a mom,

417
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,385
but those two...

418
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:03,191
kissed in front of their friends at that club.

419
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:09,030
I'm telling you because I'm worried about you girls.

420
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,532
You must be careful.

421
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,236
Make sure you share this with Kyung Joo, okay?

422
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,204
Okay.

423
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:18,807
So you're telling me that...

424
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,076
she dismissed me not because of...

425
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:24,412
what her best friend told her, but because of what that lady told her?

426
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:25,981
Precisely.

427
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,984
So try to lead a decent life, you punk.

428
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,018
You little...

429
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:33,588
Is she sure that it was Tae Hee? What else did they talk about?

430
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:35,323
Something about a dish.

431
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:43,298
- It is her. - Hey, that Chinese lady.

432
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,100
She's so cool.

433
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,969
She's so charismatic and feisty.

434
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:52,073
I would like her to take care of my sixth older brother.

435
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,541
She can straighten him out in a month.

436
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,310
I was a fool for trusting you with it.

437
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:58,880
She had no choice but to believe what that lady said.

438
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,384
Other people's opinions scare girls the most in the early phases.

439
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:04,686
I don't care, so don't you ever mention her name again.

440
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:10,158
Why are you so grumpy?

441
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:13,194
The finishing line is so close. You couldn't seal the deal.

442
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:14,296
- Poor you. - Shut it.

443
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:17,999
It's all moot anyway. You can't fool me when it comes to dating.

444
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:20,602
You changed your passcode to her number, right?

445
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,038
How about that now? Wasn't she so touched?

446
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:24,339
Get lost.

447
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:30,545
All right.

448
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:33,315
Taking it slow can be fun too.

449
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,853
Seeing how you look better, it must be fun hanging out with her.

450
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:41,856
We're not taking anything slow, you moron.

451
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,625
And what do you mean I look better?

452
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,126
No, you don't get it.

453
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:47,696
When you came to the hotel after your dad kicked you out,

454
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:48,897
you looked like a zombie.

455
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:51,166
But lately, you've been dressing up nicely and going out.

456
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,600
You look like a decent man.

457
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,938
Even if that were true, none of this is real.

458
00:28:57,772 --> 00:28:58,873
My gosh.

459
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:04,179
Hey, this kimchi is good.

460
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,915
Don't eat my kimchi. Get out of here.

461
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,017
I can go out when the sun sets.

462
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:14,456
Wait, does that mean Soo Ji is going to get your car?

463
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:18,960
I'll leave soon.

464
00:29:20,495 --> 00:29:22,564
You've been visiting a lot lately.

465
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:25,100
I can't visit often once my semester starts even if I wanted to now.

466
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,437
That's my point. Go on dates and trips when you have time now.

467
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:30,939
Right here. Look at this.

468
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,141
Isn't this your boyfriend, Tae Hee?

469
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:36,244
I sent this photo to our old teacher and asked about him.

470
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:39,714
She remembers him. She said his name is Si Hyun. Isn't that his name?

471
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:42,017
Yes, it is. It's Kwon Si Hyun.

472
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:45,053
She was the wife of this foundation's vice chairman,

473
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,489
but she passed away two years ago.

474
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:48,757
- My goodness. - Poor thing.

475
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:51,526
She did recognize him after all these years.

476
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,361
What took you so long?

477
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,897
Where have you been all these years?

478
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:57,832
I thought you were dead.

479
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:03,905
My heart breaks that he lost his mother.

480
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,874
It must have broken his heart.

481
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,842
Let's show this photo when he comes back next time.

482
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:09,844
Will he remember though?

483
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:14,349
No, I don't think he's coming back.

484
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,483
You're wrong.

485
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:18,086
He came yesterday in his black coat.

486
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:20,088
Sorry?

487
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,563
My gosh, Kwon Si Hyun.

488
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:31,132
What's your real side?
