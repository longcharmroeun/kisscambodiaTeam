00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,278
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:18,822
Tae Hee, your passcode.

3
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,457
- What? - What's your passcode?

4
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:22,125
Be quiet.

5
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,028
I need the passcode to get you in.

6
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,896
It's your phone number.

7
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:37,641
My gosh.

8
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,765
Are you okay? Hey.

9
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,636
I saved your head.

10
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,067
It's not because of you.

11
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,003
It's not because of you.

12
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,073
It's me.

13
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,743
I know that...

14
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,747
you waited for me to tell you my secret first.

15
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:26,449
I know that even if I didn't tell you,

16
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,820
you would've pretended not to know.

17
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,992
But I was mean to you when you were being considerate.

18
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,130
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:58,982
Hang in there a bit longer.

20
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,254
Things will get better...

21
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:06,890
for you...

22
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,028
and me.

23
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,319
Things will get better...

24
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:41,024
for you...

25
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,993
and me.

26
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,232
For you...

27
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,469
and me.

28
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:16,826
You're still new to driving. Why are you driving at night?

29
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,328
I was just practicing.

30
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,999
You have to adjust the rear-view mirror for you.

31
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,001
It's been two years since your mom drove this car, right?

32
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:27,504
Then this car needs a full checkup.

33
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:29,873
Let me see.

34
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:39,682
Come on. Try not to fall backward.

35
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:44,854
Is Si Hyun here?

36
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,557
He was here for a moment.

37
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,296
Soo Ji.

38
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:55,698
Let's tell Si Hyun...

39
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,800
not to visit that woman.

40
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,136
It won't be good...

41
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:01,804
for both you and Si Hyun.

42
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,040
No, it won't affect me.

43
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,676
Si Hyun will suffer in the end.

44
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,746
Do you think you'll be happy?

45
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:13,950
I'm not criticizing you.

46
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,553
I'm telling you this because I know you.

47
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,135
The three of us can't be together forever,

48
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,170
but...

49
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:36,940
no one should get their hearts broken.

50
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,442
Are you talking about yourself?

51
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:40,877
No.

52
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,912
It's about you and Si Hyun.

53
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:45,815
Both of you...

54
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:48,751
suffered enough because of your parents.

55
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:53,122
Now, let the flow take us wherever it may be.

56
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,061
Okay?

57
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,699
It's nice to hear from you, Si Hyun.

58
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,568
I returned to my workshop now.

59
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,937
I added the map and my number.

60
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:10,139
Call me when you arrive in Icheon.

61
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:26,756
Oh, my head.

62
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,997
This is what a hangover feels like.

63
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:56,986
Tae Hee, where are you? Are you not coming in today?

64
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:00,189
You got home safely, right? Text me back if you're alive.

65
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,484
Si Hyun?

66
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:47,136
Going down.

67
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,931
Si Hyun!

68
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,549
- Get out. - Go away.

69
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,184
I need to talk to you, so get out.

70
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,120
Get out.

71
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:45,762
What do you want?

72
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:48,498
That's what I want to ask. What is this?

73
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,666
What about that?

74
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,735
Explain it to me.

75
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:55,605
Why did you do this if you hated me?

76
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,374
I did it out of pity. Happy?

77
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,876
"Out of pity"?

78
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:05,081
Why would you pity me if you hated me?

79
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:09,385
Then what's this?

80
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:16,492
I give these things to just anybody.

81
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:17,960
Am I just anybody?

82
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,365
Then throw it away. You're rich.

83
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,333
This is nothing to you.

84
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:28,638
Throw it away in front of me.

85
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,874
Say it again.

86
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,978
Did our time mean nothing to you?

87
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,248
Was I the only one who had feelings?

88
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,020
Stop it, okay?

89
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,189
Things are already tough enough for me.

90
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,858
Yes, so tell me what they are.

91
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:51,260
Why do you always go through things by yourself?

92
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:00,469
This is your mom's. Isn't it precious to you?

93
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,648
You're so awful.

94
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:15,885
If you can't throw it away, why did you give it to me?

95
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:18,955
If you give me something...

96
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:20,756
even I can't throw away,

97
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:23,092
what do you want me to do with it?

98
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:31,000
The owner of this necklace...

99
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:34,237
has hit you.

100
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,007
What?

101
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,210
It's the shameless person who almost killed you...

102
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,913
in that hit-and-run incident.

103
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:49,352
I knew it was her when you told me that story when we went on the trip.

104
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,757
So please let me go.

105
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,227
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,302
It's not your fault.

107
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:09,338
You didn't do it.

108
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,008
You didn't know that when we first met.

109
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,376
Why do we have to break up?

110
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,613
You...

111
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,216
You went through a lot after that.

112
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:23,219
You'll be reminded of that incident whenever you see me.

113
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:24,987
No.

114
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,890
I'm fine, so it's okay.

115
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,361
Please believe me.

116
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:36,999
I'm okay...

117
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:41,637
because I have met you. Okay?

118
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,749
It must've been so hard for you.

119
00:11:56,886 --> 00:12:00,022
At least I had someone else to blame.

120
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:03,192
You must've been in so much pain by yourself.

121
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,397
I'm fine.

122
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:11,033
I hope you'll be okay...

123
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:13,903
like how I'm fine right now.

124
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,108
Don't break up with me.

125
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,258
Can we...

126
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,127
talk?

127
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:48,738
I was wrong.

128
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:52,408
I'm sorry.

129
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,612
I will never say...

130
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,715
or do anything I don't mean.

131
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,251
I'm sorry.

132
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:07,189
He has to say he is sorry and that he was wrong...

133
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,959
at least three times.

134
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,294
And you can think about taking him back...

135
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,796
three times too.

136
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,331
And then what?

137
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:17,333
Do whatever you want.

138
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,735
If you think he's lovely again, be nice to him.

139
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,805
If you still feel sour,

140
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,241
you can pinch him.

141
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,577
I think the most important thing is that you won't say...

142
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,579
anything you don't mean.

143
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,014
What?

144
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:36,218
Everything I told you was from the bottom of my heart.

145
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:38,421
This is bad news.

146
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:41,157
I only had one forgiveness card, and I used it already.

147
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,025
Maybe you didn't need...

148
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,628
any forgiveness cards from the beginning.

149
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,029
What do you mean?

150
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:50,599
I keep being too generous for you only.

151
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,136
I'm only generous and forgiving to you.

152
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:56,972
This has never happened to me before,

153
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,143
but my heart just wants to understand you.

154
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:04,980
I find myself very strange when I'm like this.

155
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:07,349
What about you?

156
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,392
Tae Hee.

157
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:19,762
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,764
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:25,301
Saying you're sorry isn't going to cut everything.

160
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:26,502
I know.

161
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:29,405
I'm more thankful than I'm sorry,

162
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:31,740
and more than that,

163
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:35,244
I love you.

164
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,682
I'm telling you everything that's in my heart.

165
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,784
Goodness.

166
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,746
You know, if...

167
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,887
I ever have to...

168
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:21,490
ask you for forgiveness again,

169
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,126
what should I do?

170
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,264
Why? Are you going to make another mistake?

171
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:33,869
Just tell me what's in your heart.

172
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,272
And...

173
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,807
I think you should...

174
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:43,245
give the other party enough space and time to think and forgive you.

175
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,481
Can you forgive someone after time passes?

176
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:49,485
It depends on what they've done.

177
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,355
Have some before it gets cold.

178
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,893
I know...

179
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:02,731
who the woman that my dad has been seeing is.

180
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,770
Isn't he getting married soon?

181
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,837
He is.

182
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,839
You must hate him a lot.

183
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,342
He's known her for a long time.

184
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:16,345
I think my mom knew her too.

185
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:19,882
What's on your mind?

186
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,223
I want to make her suffer.

187
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,860
I was actually on my way to see her.

188
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:35,130
That must've been tough.

189
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,234
I was in your shoes too.

190
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:42,371
May I ask...

191
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:47,376
what she's like?

192
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:50,312
She's a better person than I had imagined.

193
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,248
Then can you not do this?

194
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:57,119
I wish you could only do things that made you happy.

195
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:01,490
I'm worried that you'll be troubled again.

196
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:03,892
Do you think...

197
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:06,996
you'll really feel better after you do that?

198
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,897
Do you?

199
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:16,171
Let's see.

200
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,685
You must be in a great mood.

201
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,854
You're giving a kid like me some green vegetable juice.

202
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:34,023
My investment is looking promising.

203
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,892
Good luck at work today, Se Joo.

204
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,084
- What? - Soo Ji.

205
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:03,585
Did you sleep well?

206
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,155
I'm tired. I dreamt all night long.

207
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,457
Should I get you some tonic? Only if it wasn't my dream.

208
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:09,558
I'm hanging up.

209
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:12,361
Hey, you know that it's Si Hyun's birthday, right?

210
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,797
I'm surprised you didn't forget.

211
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:16,365
I'm hanging up.

212
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,238
Has she been adding hormone drugs in here?

213
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:26,642
Why do I always feel like crying when Soo Ji hangs up on me?

214
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:38,053
- Here. - I haven't had...

215
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,655
breakfast in so long.

216
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,660
Thanks for the food.

217
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,563
Let's eat and go to school together. I'll give you a ride.

218
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:49,098
- Really? - Yes.

219
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:51,433
What will you do after?

220
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,839
I'm going to go see that woman I talked about yesterday.

221
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,543
What are you going to say to her?

222
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:02,778
I'm not sure.

223
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,884
- Were you that hungry for my love? - What?

224
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:11,820
There.

225
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:15,924
I always eat the ketchup first.

226
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:21,697
Have some more.

227
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,432
Three times more.

228
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:28,537
134... 8...

229
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,106
Four.

230
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,575
(8th Grade Math)

231
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:38,514
I'm studying really hard today.

232
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:42,117
Dreaming of seeing you is helping me concentrate.

233
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,787
Work hard, my love.

234
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:49,057
Hye Jeong, what are you doing?

235
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,225
I'm coming.

236
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:52,961
It's Ki Young's father's birthday,

237
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,696
so I picked a theme.

238
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,566
It's all about elegance,

239
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,334
purity,

240
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,370
and luxury.

241
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,338
We'll add this...

242
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,674
for a little more purity.

243
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:08,977
Kyu Jeong, sound off.

244
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:13,048
It's fine. I play games when I'm stressed too.

245
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:16,385
This will be a bit tighter.

246
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,153
Why's the fabric so clumped?

247
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:20,222
Mom, that's my waist.

248
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,659
She's trying to lose weight.

249
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,627
She has no weight to lose.

250
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:28,831
She looks beautiful in...

251
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:31,667
How soulless. You're a great liar.

252
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:39,475
Hye Jeong.

253
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:42,478
I really do think you're pretty in anything.

254
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:45,280
You'd say that. You know nothing about fashion.

255
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:49,051
Mom, I'll buy clothes with Soo Ji.

256
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,553
Just looking at this makes me constipated.

257
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,555
Where are you going?

258
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:54,890
To poop!

259
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:58,160
She just reached puberty.

260
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:02,564
Did she eat something weird? Hye Jeong.

261
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,968
What a waste of time.

262
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,406
Hey.

263
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,175
What are you doing?

264
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:20,315
I'll be your brother-in-law. You should watch your manners.

265
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:21,950
What if someone sees you?

266
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,424
This is unbelievable.

267
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,127
I get off early today because it's just a tutoring session.

268
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,262
- Let's have dinner together. - Okay.

269
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,366
You look different. Is something wrong?

270
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,101
No.

271
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:19,174
You're worried I'll feel down when I get back.

272
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,543
You're serious again.

273
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:24,880
It's not that.

274
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:29,051
- See you later. Bye. - Bye.

275
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:36,925
Thanks for your help last time.

276
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,994
We put you in a tough spot.

277
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:40,462
You did.

278
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:44,633
I dare need to ask for another favor.

279
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,069
That's why I asked to see you.

280
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:50,472
I heard your marriage was postponed.

281
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:53,241
- Pardon? - Is it because of...

282
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:54,910
your drug's clinical test result?

283
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:57,713
Yes.

284
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,215
If it's cleared this time,

285
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:03,151
we could put it on the shelves in time.

286
00:23:04,786 --> 00:23:06,355
I'd like you to help.

287
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:08,957
Very well.

288
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,360
I'm sure you'll follow the laws and regulations.

289
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:13,662
But...

290
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:17,633
don't you think I deserve something this time?

291
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:23,138
I understand, sir.

292
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:27,075
How about your daughter's job that you mentioned last time?

293
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,414
Like you suggested,

294
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:35,317
I want to aim for something bigger.

295
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:38,120
I'd like you to...

296
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:42,090
open up your VIP center to my supporters.

297
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,862
(Top Secret)

298
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,598
Let's help each other...

299
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:51,566
fly higher.

300
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,472
Very well.

301
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:29,071
How did you find me here?

302
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,341
I think Si Hyun...

303
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,944
knows about Seol Young Won.

304
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:41,950
I bet Soo Ji told him.

305
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,123
He asked if she was involved in his mother's accident.

306
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:49,558
I told him...

307
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,560
the accident happened when...

308
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,662
his mom went to meet her.

309
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,664
Why did you tell him that?

310
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:58,867
It's best he believes that and stops digging.

311
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:00,802
He won't dig further.

312
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:05,674
Mi Ri. What did you do...

313
00:25:06,108 --> 00:25:08,376
with the car?

314
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:11,313
It's in the garage.

315
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,615
I haven't seen it in years.

316
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,859
Si Hyun will meet Seol Young Won.

317
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,962
Vice Chairman Kwon won't be able to see her anymore.

318
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,830
It works out for you.

319
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:30,365
If...

320
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,136
Si Hyun looks into the accident and finds out that...

321
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,574
his mother wasn't the perpetrator,

322
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:41,676
I'll deal with it then.

323
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:43,411
What will you do?

324
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:44,946
Don't worry.

325
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,692
Here, drink it.

326
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:39,434
Did you draw a lot since we last met?

327
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,037
No.

328
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,442
I slacked off for a while.

329
00:26:47,843 --> 00:26:49,277
I should get back on track.

330
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,113
Right.

331
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,652
Why did you want to see me?

332
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:22,544
These are all mine.

333
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,015
What book is this?

334
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:29,050
(JK Cultural Foundation)

335
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:31,653
Yes.

336
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:33,822
Kwon Seok Woo is...

337
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:35,624
my father.

338
00:27:37,392 --> 00:27:39,628
My mom died two years ago.

339
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:43,865
In a car accident in Jeongeup where she had no reason to be.

340
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:51,139
I always wondered...

341
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:55,377
why she left the hospital to go there.

342
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,882
I guess...

343
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,552
she wanted to see for herself.

344
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,422
Or maybe...

345
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,558
she wanted to beg you to break up with him.

346
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,030
My mom was always lonely.

347
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,901
She placed a huge ceramic vase in the lobby...

348
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:23,104
and looked at it whenever she passed by.

349
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:25,874
She told herself she's the owner...

350
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:29,644
and that she deserved to be married to my dad.

351
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,548
She comforted and confirmed it herself.

352
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:36,451
That's how she lived.

353
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:39,921
Yes.

354
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,225
I know that saying this won't change anything.

355
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:48,697
And that my mom won't come back,

356
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,934
but I wanted to tell you this.

357
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:57,372
Because you two didn't know how to put an end to things...

358
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,742
Because of that one day, my mom died.

359
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:06,514
Someone innocent ended up paying.

360
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:10,618
It's unfair that those two people get...

361
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:14,622
to meet and be happy again.

362
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,772
Hold on.

363
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,078
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:40,181
I'm really sorry.

365
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,627
- Yes? - I need to talk to you.

366
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,162
Come home.

367
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,264
Okay.

368
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:31,666
I have something to tell you too.

369
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:56,124
Are you on your way? Did something happen?

370
00:30:57,258 --> 00:31:00,328
(Kwon Seok Woo)

371
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:06,801
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

372
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:21,382
What is that?

373
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,451
It's the school in Seoul I'll transfer to.

374
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:26,588
Kyung Joo goes here, so you don't need to worry.

375
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:29,023
You can't transfer schools.

376
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:32,227
You told Dad that you'd stay with me.

377
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:35,296
(Joosung High School)

378
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:38,633
You know that I only told him that to ease his mind.

379
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,435
I want to start my new semester there.

380
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:42,904
Change my address to Aunt Geum Sil's.

381
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:43,972
Later.

382
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:46,307
I hate asking you for a favor.

383
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,543
What choice do I have? I need my guardian's consent.

384
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:50,879
I got it. We can talk about this later.

385
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:52,614
Leave me alone!

386
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:54,816
My gosh.

387
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,052
Hey, your shoelace is untied.

388
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,022
Si Hyun must be thinking about you.

389
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,791
- You're unbelievable. - Tie it tightly.

390
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,793
You said you two won't ever break up now.

391
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:40,795
My gosh, I got it.

392
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:28,876
Are you okay?

393
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,180
Give me your hand.

394
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,922
She didn't even say sorry?

395
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,057
What is it?

396
00:33:44,492 --> 00:33:47,528
This is probably the first time I've seen her car, right?

397
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:48,663
Probably.

398
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,365
Why?

399
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:52,100
It's nothing.

400
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:05,780
Your grandmother is back.

401
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:09,417
I don't know when she will want to meet President Myung and Soo Ji.

402
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:10,785
Wait until I call.

403
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:12,720
Are you sure you want me to come?

404
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,921
The only thing...

405
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:15,490
that keeps your grandmother up is...

406
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,160
her hope of turning JK to you and Yeo Min.

407
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,262
That's why we need President Myung.

408
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:24,599
Don't be rash and disappoint her.

409
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,534
Just be honest.

410
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,136
You need President Myung and me...

411
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:31,039
because you want Grandmother to acknowledge you.

412
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,709
You always keep people around you out of necessity.

413
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,646
If you needed us that badly,

414
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,481
you should've treated us better.

415
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:42,150
I don't want to fight.

416
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,453
Let me check one thing and finish this conversation.

417
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:49,223
What do you plan to do with Soo Ji?

418
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:52,160
- What about her? - She visited me.

419
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:55,229
She wanted to marry you.

420
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:03,538
I don't believe it's love.

421
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,807
Did you want to secure...

422
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,910
your spot in the family by marrying Soo Ji?

423
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,111
No.

424
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:14,115
It's you who want to secure your spot by using President Myung.

425
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:19,320
Should I tell you whom I just met?

426
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,492
Ms. Seol Young Won.
