00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,445
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,950
No way. Look at her outfits.

3
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,495
Do her parents abuse her at home or something?

4
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:20,565
She would never figure out she's peculiar.

5
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:23,265
She has no friends.

6
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:26,195
It seems like she doesn't.

7
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:29,905
Aren't you friends with Eun Tae Hee?

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,135
What is she like?

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:35,670
Well, when my friend, Tae Hee,

10
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:39,240
sees a guy waiting for her on her usual route...

11
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:40,615
What's his deal?

12
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,585
She hates that.

13
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,040
If...

14
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm in front of your building. I'll wait until you come down.

15
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:50,355
If a guy waits the whole night...

16
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,705
Is it possible that no guy ever told her that he liked her?

17
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:04,975
No, Kyung Joo said she was popular even in Germany.

18
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:08,970
The guy Kyung Joo likes ends up liking Tae Hee.

19
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,815
She said that was the jinx between them.

20
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,940
Luckily, they could stay as best friends...

21
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,685
since Tae Hee was never interested in dating.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,810
She's not interested in dating.

23
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:22,285
But why did Kyung Joo share everything with you?

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,195
So what did you tell her on the bus?

25
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:30,095
That was you?

26
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,935
Don't you think it's enough to say that we are meant to be?

27
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,105
I'm okay as long as you weren't hurt.

28
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:42,970
Come on, why did you get off then? You should've followed her.

29
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,375
You said she's kind.

30
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:47,785
Since I got off without saying much to her,

31
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:50,715
her guilt will eat her up.

32
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:58,750
I agree.

33
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:00,720
She will be less cautious of you when you see her next time.

34
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:01,965
That's right.

35
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,135
Then are you meeting her next...

36
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:06,095
at the district library?

37
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:07,865
Are you going to follow her again?

38
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,665
Like it's a coincidence again?

39
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,860
When coincidences repeat, she will feel like it's fate.

40
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:15,600
- She'll end up believing it's fate. - Hello.

41
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:17,715
Why? Because she wants to believe in fate.

42
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:22,515
Hey, hey. That's so lame.

43
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:26,040
Embracing her from behind looks only romantic on TV. It's lame.

44
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:29,585
1 touch is equivalent to 100 words.

45
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,320
45 degrees up from her eyes.

46
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,955
Chiseled jawline.

47
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,565
Oh, man. Make sure you show her that.

48
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,470
Wait. What was her name again?

49
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:51,100
Eun Tae Hee. Try to remember her name.

50
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,370
Eun Tae Hee. Eun Tae Hee, right.

51
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,440
If our great tempter, Kwon Si Hyun,

52
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:56,810
could do some method-acting,

53
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,015
his handsome looks would be enough to rule the world.

54
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,425
Right?

55
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:05,020
Hey, what do you mean I can't act?

56
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,865
I might end up falling for her, you know.

57
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,325
Look in the mirror.

58
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,320
Your eyes are like the mirror Cinderella's stepmother has.

59
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:14,905
They are full of honesty. I can see right through you.

60
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:16,105
That's all right.

61
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,345
No woman can look at me in the eye...

62
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:22,400
- because her heart would flutter. - Cut it out.

63
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,640
Leave her before lunch.

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,445
Why? I should have lunch with her to get close.

65
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,570
The best meal to develop relationships...

66
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:30,040
would be the brunch after sleeping with the girl.

67
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,485
You can't. You look like a fool when you eat.

68
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,525
Then...

69
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,925
How about going day drinking? She can drink as much as...

70
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,090
8 glasses. 8...

71
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,190
8 bottles?

72
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:46,595
- That's the infinity symbol. - I know. It's the idol group.

73
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,630
Do you not know the term, "infinity"?

74
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,135
The mathematical term, infinity?

75
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,475
Is this what it means?

76
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,205
- Did you know that too? - Me?

77
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,240
I can't believe I'm friends with these fools.

78
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:02,645
What am I doing here? It's too early.

79
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,025
Okay.

80
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,265
Gosh, it's so bitter. Why do people drink this?

81
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,005
Can you do something about that?

82
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:36,415
- Hey. - What?

83
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:44,655
Do you have something to tell me?

84
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,665
If you don't, I'm going to go.

85
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,335
Have...

86
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,365
lunch with me.

87
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,385
I was starving.

88
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,710
You seem to enjoy your sleep.

89
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,955
I couldn't get much sleep because I was moving.

90
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,420
- Do you live around here? - Yes.

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,720
- Do you often visit the library? - I think so.

92
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:22,465
- But you came to see me today. - That's right.

93
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:25,865
Oh, no.

94
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,435
You got me.

95
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,530
Actually, I came a few more times before.

96
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,805
I thought I could see you here.

97
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:37,675
When I first saw you, I saw you getting off in front of the library.

98
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,785
You seemed to enjoy your sleep then.

99
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,285
I didn't fall asleep.

100
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:55,125
I'll show you an easy way to eat it.

101
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,260
First, the bones in its back and the stomach...

102
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,635
Remove the major bones on both ends first.

103
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,365
Then you can enjoy the fish.

104
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,205
Eat up.

105
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,045
It's your favorite. You won't get to eat this often in Germany.

106
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,075
I guess Mom's really not going to come.

107
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:15,310
You know that she doesn't leave the kiln once she starts baking.

108
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:16,440
We should try to understand her.

109
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,555
That's exactly my point. Why does she have to bake today?

110
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,285
Forget what I said.

111
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,755
You shouldn't be sorry.

112
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,095
You don't like cutlassfish.

113
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:32,835
Do you want another dish?

114
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,905
I heard a lot about you.

115
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,675
A popular guy at Joosung High School.

116
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:41,600
You're a man about town students from other schools come to see.

117
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,600
I can't believe Kyung Joo told you that.

118
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:46,215
- Come on, eat up. - But she said I must be careful.

119
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,910
You're a troublemaker...

120
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,915
who would do anything if it means you can seduce the girl.

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,110
You saw me for the first time on the bus.

122
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:55,825
You put out your will as your bait which was ridiculous.

123
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:01,465
Is this how you seduced Kyung Joo's mom?

124
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,035
I didn't have to use these childish tactics to her.

125
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,375
Perhaps, you didn't hear the whole story.

126
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:16,875
Should I tell you the details?

127
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,675
Details about how we had fun?

128
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,315
No, there's no need.

129
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:25,880
I don't want to spend another minute with someone...

130
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:27,325
who toys with someone's heart.

131
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,555
I hope I never see you again.

132
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:40,435
What's up with that skirt? It's too long.

133
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:43,490
- It's not your style. - Consider it my combat uniform.

134
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,205
I already know what type of family it must be.

135
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:50,300
You won't nag your girlfriend because her skirt is too short.

136
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,800
I like that about you.

137
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,645
I ought to sue everyone who whines about women's skirt lengths.

138
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,445
That's a violation of a basic human right.

139
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,185
Wait, I know who will be your girlfriend.

140
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,325
What?

141
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:03,155
I slept by myself last night.

142
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:07,765
I'm not talking about how you sleep with women before you befriend them.

143
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,765
What's she saying?

144
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,735
Hey, what is it?

145
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:15,205
Whom are you talking about?

146
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:17,065
Am I dating someone?

147
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:20,405
The crazy Lee Se Joo? Why?

148
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,945
He's so cool because he's crazy.

149
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:25,715
What's Se Joo's type?

150
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,045
No idea. I don't care...

151
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:30,340
Well, not that I don't.

152
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,080
Someone who's a bit like you.

153
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:35,585
You should've just handed the country over, not your friend.

154
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,350
I'm not telling you to date her.

155
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:39,655
Just take her out once. You have nothing to do anyway.

156
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:42,825
I'm a busy man. I have a lot of girls to meet.

157
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,990
I'll get you out to the hospital.

158
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:46,865
Legitimately, through the secretary's office.

159
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,435
- Here it is. - Thank you.

160
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:52,430
I'm a humanist.

161
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,030
I can love every single human being.

162
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:56,445
But not Kyung Joo.

163
00:08:57,273 --> 00:09:01,015
First of all, you need to get closer to Hye Jeong's mom to see her.

164
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:02,645
That's what her family is like.

165
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,015
The most important thing is to be fashionable.

166
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:09,555
She thinks she's Meryl Streep of "The Devil Wears Prada".

167
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:23,860
Welcome.

168
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:27,075
Goodness, you finally came around.

169
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:29,030
Thank you for inviting me.

170
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:32,045
My goodness, how beautiful.

171
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:00,870
Bravo.

172
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,915
Hye Jeong, you picked that up at an amazing speed.

173
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:06,815
That was great.

174
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,240
Your arm strength, I mean.

175
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,780
You should ask Soo Ji to teach you a lot.

176
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,485
You'll make it if you try just a little harder.

177
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,155
It would be great if you two could see classical concerts together.

178
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:20,595
Yes, if we have time.

179
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:24,435
I'm sad that I didn't get to see you play at the Supporters' Night.

180
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:27,965
Anyway, it looked like you had no idea...

181
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,565
that your mom was getting married.

182
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:34,905
I was wondering why you didn't ask.

183
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,870
It was a surprise event, so I acted like I didn't know.

184
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:40,145
My mom is cute like that.

185
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:44,315
I see. She's such a prankster.

186
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:48,025
Then may I ask you to play a song?

187
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:51,655
What a good liar. You didn't even blink an eye.

188
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:53,195
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:55,665
May I play for you next time with my instrument?

190
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:58,690
I know my mom lets you have all of your ways,

191
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,060
so you must think I'm a joke too.

192
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:03,090
Of course. It would be more comfortable to use your own.

193
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,735
I sounded very ignorant.

194
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:10,075
Look at the way she talks back at me with everything I say. What a brat.

195
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,870
There's nothing you can do even if you think I'm a brat.

196
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,145
I'm a part of JK Group.

197
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,755
What are you two doing? Sending telepathies?

198
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:25,795
Please excuse me.

199
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,295
I was reading.

200
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,190
Have fun.

201
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,635
See you later.

202
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:42,875
("Secrets in Bed")

203
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,345
Look at the way she says everything she wants while smiling.

204
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:52,685
She's just like her mom.

205
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,975
I wouldn't take it even if you gave it to me.

206
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:17,900
- What's wrong? - I'm hopeless at cello, right?

207
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,970
- Yes. - Right?

208
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,910
Then can you tell that to my mom?

209
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:26,140
Cello strings are strangling me, and pianos pin me down...

210
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:29,385
in my dreams. It's really killing me.

211
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,725
I'm not your tutor.

212
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,725
Fine.

213
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:38,395
Why is it so hot in here?

214
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,175
My goodness.

215
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:48,975
You're so sexy.

216
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:55,215
I'll see. If she ever asks, I'll try to bring it up.

217
00:12:56,846 --> 00:13:00,110
Right, where's Tle?

218
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:02,155
You have to say hello.

219
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,320
Tle? Who's Tle?

220
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,055
Where did Tle go?

221
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,890
My gosh, Tle.

222
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:13,920
You can't sit there and surprise Soo Ji.

223
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,565
Were you surprised?

224
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:19,200
This is my sister, Turtle. Say hello to Soo Ji.

225
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:22,200
- Do you want to hold her? - No, it's fine.

226
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:23,370
Hi, Tle.

227
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,670
She doesn't bite.

228
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:27,415
Tle, go back to your room.

229
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,270
Soo Ji, do you want to take selfies, then?

230
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,915
Okay, should we?

231
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,385
Come here. Let's take it here.

232
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,555
Soo Ji, do you want to hold this too?

233
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,390
These cupcakes are from the second son of the law firm.

234
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,765
Gosh, thank you.

235
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,705
They look so good.

236
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,970
Your mom said she will thank him.

237
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,275
You don't need to call him.

238
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:58,645
Okay.

239
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,715
I thought of you when I had this patissier's cupcakes.

240
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,855
I hope this makes a sweet present for you. From Ki Young.

241
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:11,595
What's with the way you talk?

242
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:14,350
Do you think this is the 1900s? Are you writing a poem?

243
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,190
What did you say? Aren't you going to eat?

244
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,595
This is really good.

245
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:19,135
I wanted to take more selfies.

246
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,675
In 1, 2, 3.

247
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:29,070
After I met her, I kind of felt bad for her.

248
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:30,870
She only had a turtle to talk to.

249
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:32,170
So for a second,

250
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,545
I felt bad and thought I'd become like a sister for her.

251
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:38,140
But my gosh, Ki Young. He sent cute cupcakes.

252
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,210
This is your fourth serving.

253
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:41,225
Leave me alone. I need the energy to fight.

254
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:43,850
You can't put up a fight if you get fat.

255
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:46,480
- Get fat? What? - Pardon?

256
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:49,425
Who are you to say that my only weapon is my body?

257
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:52,590
I never knew that you could eat pig skin.

258
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,790
You have respect for women's sexual desires,

259
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:57,635
skirt lengths, and hairstyle, but you deny their appetite?

260
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,030
I know how to eat pig skin. I love it.

261
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:03,670
Exactly. I had to set everything up by myself. It was hard.

262
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:04,775
Great job.

263
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,570
You know that I'm called the Barbeque Master, right?

264
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:09,685
They pop up when they get cooked, so only I can grill this.

265
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,315
Make sure you dip it in bean flour.

266
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,315
- Gosh. - Darn you.

267
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,980
- I failed. - What now? What is it?

268
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,595
She knows everything including how I met Kyung Joo's mom.

269
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:24,490
Did Kyung Joo tell her that? That her mom and you did that?

270
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,420
What? No way. She'd be talking bad about her mom.

271
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:27,635
No idea.

272
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:31,200
Wait, what was your bet again? I never heard that part.

273
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,430
What? You didn't know?

274
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:34,575
She didn't want to marry without love, so...

275
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,230
What? What is it?

276
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,470
The loser will go on a hunger strike.

277
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:41,010
That 1 of the 2 will die of hunger if they get married.

278
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,515
A hunger strike? You?

279
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,880
Keep grilling. He's starving.

280
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:46,880
Okay, wait.

281
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,350
If you win, you will go on a hunger strike.

282
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,325
If you lose, are you going to starve?

283
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:53,720
His dad won't budge even if he starved.

284
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:56,090
I know. He said he'll hand his car over.

285
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,165
What?

286
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,660
Darn it. You can't give up now.

287
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:00,790
Eat up, and get more energy.

288
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,860
I can bear to see your dad and her mom get married,

289
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:05,130
but not your car get taken away.

290
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:07,100
So are you telling me to starve?

291
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,245
You should eat a lot now.

292
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:17,985
(I hope this makes a sweet present for you. From Ki Young.)

293
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,055
I don't see it in here either.

294
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,755
- Are you looking for something? - What?

295
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,595
Oh, a plane.

296
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,795
- Are those good? - Totally.

297
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:33,195
You should hurry up and send him a picture saying you got them.

298
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:36,105
- No. It's too embarrassing. - Look over here.

299
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,535
Show me a smile.

300
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:46,270
- Ki Young, the cupcakes were good. - So cute.

301
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,415
Thank you.

302
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,685
You're so cute.

303
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:53,055
I can get 100 of them for you.

304
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,520
(Hye Jeong's mom)

305
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,550
Hye Jeong said she loves the cupcakes.

306
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:03,765
Thanks for the thought.

307
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:09,335
Why does it feel like I'm getting tamed?

308
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:16,375
(Park Hye Jeong)

309
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,085
- There's a taxi. - Okay.

310
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,440
- Please get in. - Goodbye.

311
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:28,925
Bye. Text me when you get there.

312
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,525
- Hurry up, and go home. - Bye.

313
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:49,775
Gosh.

314
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:07,695
Was I too harsh?

315
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,465
It didn't even happen to me.

316
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:16,935
Shall I give you the details of what we did?

317
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:20,805
Whatever.

318
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,675
I'll give him his plane or will, whatever it was.

319
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,575
And then I'll end it properly.

320
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,255
(Kwon Si Hyun)

321
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,525
1, 2...

322
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,550
(Eun Tae Hee)

323
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,665
(Kwon Si Hyun)

324
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,435
What was that? Why did he even call?

325
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:55,145
That should bother her.

326
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:10,710
Are you going out this afternoon?

327
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,525
Shopping. For something to wear when the new term starts.

328
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,665
Shall I join you?

329
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:17,425
We can get our hair done.

330
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:20,165
What for? Aren't you busy?

331
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,075
Whom will you go with?

332
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,805
You know I can't go shopping with anyone.

333
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,275
You've been seeing Hye Jeong.

334
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:35,370
I find it interesting that you befriended her.

335
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,845
And strange.

336
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:42,325
It's more interesting and strange that you're dating Si Hyun's dad.

337
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,295
Does he even like you for real?

338
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,295
Whatever.

339
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:53,935
Get me a new bed. I can't sleep.

340
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,775
- Keep this bed. - I can't sleep.

341
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:02,875
We'll move into a new house soon.

342
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,615
Bear with it until then.

343
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,585
Thank you.

344
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:37,245
(Vice Chairman Kwon Seok Woo)

345
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:40,775
(Vice Chairman Kwon Seok Woo)

346
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:48,010
I got the foundation's budget for this year.

347
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,855
I think you should clear this.

348
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:54,920
The proposal on the new medication that Secretary Yoon brought over...

349
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,525
Did you have breakfast?

350
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:58,995
I only had a cup of coffee.

351
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:00,535
What?

352
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,905
You talked about work first.

353
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,035
It's upsetting.

354
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,245
Oh, sorry.

355
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:11,105
Are you free the day you return from your business trip?

356
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,675
Let's have dinner with the kids.

357
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:16,945
Sure, I'll free my schedule.

358
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,110
Pick a place Si Hyun likes...

359
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:22,280
Let's meet at the hotel we had the event at.

360
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,455
(Flowers to Seol Young Won were delivered.)

361
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,620
Who sent these?

362
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,495
I don't know. It doesn't say.

363
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:28,695
They're my favorite flowers.

364
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,195
Was it you?

365
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:37,505
Fortunately for us, it was not.

366
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:41,445
I can't believe how disappointed you sounded.

367
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,245
Sorry.

368
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:46,115
Geum Sil.

369
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:49,415
Thanks for celebrating Tae Hee's birthday.

370
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:51,315
I completely forgot.

371
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,855
She found out.

372
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,855
She should've pretended it was from you.

373
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:57,355
Did she complain about it?

374
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,405
I feel so cold.

375
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:31,355
(Eun Tae Hee)

376
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:33,555
I left a missed call,

377
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:36,125
but she didn't call back?

378
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,505
(Kwon Si Hyun)

379
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,605
1, 2...

380
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:55,645
What is he doing?

381
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,215
What do you want?

382
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:01,625
It's such a bother.

383
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:09,325
Gosh.

384
00:23:12,928 --> 00:23:16,130
I love the makeup and everything you picked out.

385
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:17,430
I should lose weight.

386
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,800
Don't, Se Joo likes girls who eat well.

387
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:21,230
At least four portions of meat.

388
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:22,305
Really?

389
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:23,505
Ko Kyung Joo.

390
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,145
Don't forget the favor I asked.

391
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:27,600
I won't.

392
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,770
If it doesn't work out, it's not my fault.

393
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:31,185
It's not.

394
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,455
He's here.

395
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:40,350
Gosh, you should've told me.

396
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:41,625
Good luck.

397
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:47,995
Hi, Ko Kyung Joo.

398
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,005
Hi. It's been a while.

399
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,415
He said he couldn't stand her.

400
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:03,345
Oh dear. I have an appointment.

401
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:04,955
- An appointment? - An appointment?

402
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:08,110
Se Joo, take Kyung Joo home safely.

403
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,310
You two have similar sounding names.

404
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:12,255
Ko Kyung Joo, Lee Se Joo.

405
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:15,465
Go on, Se Joo. Get the door for her.

406
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:21,590
I wish you could come along. Is it an important appointment?

407
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,335
Yes, totally.

408
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:24,875
Goodbye.

409
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:29,805
Don't mess up, or our deal's off.

410
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:31,345
Keep your word.

411
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,715
Thank you.

412
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:42,725
Shall we race to your home?

413
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:44,780
Where do you live?

414
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,855
We don't have to rush.

415
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:48,895
Let's speed.

416
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:06,240
Are you having dinner?

417
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,570
No, Kyung Joo went home.

418
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:10,110
You should've fed her.

419
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:11,655
My family has a memorial service.

420
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,055
Okay, bye.

421
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,255
(Aunt Mi Soon)

422
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:22,595
Hello.

423
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,295
I'll eat at home.

424
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:28,665
Bye.

425
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,470
- What's up? - Nothing. You're leaving?

426
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,005
No, I just got here.

427
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,040
You said you had a memorial service.

428
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,345
So what? I'm starving. What shall we eat?

429
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:44,645
- Sushi. - Sure.

430
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:46,940
I just can't believe it.

431
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,110
Guess what she said.

432
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:50,610
She won't get me a new bed. I have to bear with it.

433
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,320
Just buy whatever bed you want.

434
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,950
You idiot, what do you think she means?

435
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:58,720
I have to wait until she refurnishes the house.

436
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:00,120
Let's say they get married.

437
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:03,135
Would my mom move into your place? She'd live elsewhere.

438
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,930
Since we're all here,

439
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:10,145
let's strategize. Come along, pretty boy.

440
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:14,045
Soo Ji.

441
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,385
Did you ask Kyung Joo for her help?

442
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:17,915
Focus on your own role.

443
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:21,340
Then they can meet this weekend at...

444
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,080
(Volunteer at nursing home)

445
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:26,025
- A nursing home? - No. This weekend?

446
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:28,295
No, that's just wrong.

447
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:30,065
What's that?

448
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:35,405
You were born to serve others

449
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:37,960
Some wives say they had plastic surgery,

450
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:40,935
and their husbands couldn't tell.

451
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:44,630
That's because they're husbands, not boyfriends.

452
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,870
You couldn't be bothered to use hair conditioner.

453
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,345
They recognize even the smallest of changes.

454
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,310
That means affection.

455
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:54,715
Men are surprisingly visual beings.

456
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:57,085
Where did you read that?

457
00:26:57,252 --> 00:26:59,595
All the theories I read up on until now...

458
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:02,765
are finally coming in useful.

459
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:07,135
Let's meet at a club this Saturday. Dress up.

460
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:10,165
Who is it that you're so pleased?

461
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,705
Choi Soo Ji.

462
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:14,875
I thought she'd be haughty and cold.

463
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:16,530
She isn't at all.

464
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:18,105
Good for you.

465
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:20,575
You should've become friends before you graduated.

466
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,915
- Are you upset? - No.

467
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:26,985
Hey, I suddenly feel bad.

468
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:31,510
We might not be able to meet up as much if I start dating.

469
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,220
Get yourself a boyfriend.

470
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:34,520
No, thanks.

471
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,295
Why would you talk about that?

472
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:40,635
Do you remember Kwon Si Hyun?

473
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,605
- Who? - The guy we met.

474
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,060
Right. Yes.

475
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,130
His dad and Soo Ji's mom will marry,

476
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:49,605
and they'll become step-siblings.

477
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:51,075
Wouldn't that be weird?

478
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,670
Is that true?

479
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,770
Soo Ji's really worried about him.

480
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:59,940
Si Hyun had a rough time after his mom died.

481
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:01,980
He got scolded even more for being immature.

482
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,925
And there were bad rumors about him.

483
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:07,755
But actually, he's not that bad, you know.

484
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:08,920
- He's quiet. - Eun Tae Hee.

485
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:11,420
Nursing home. Wake up. Wake up.

486
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:12,920
Nursing home. Wake up.

487
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,295
He's gentle.

488
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,335
He's kind.

489
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,335
He's handsome.

490
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:23,175
He's tall. He's cool.

491
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,370
That's why people misunderstand him as a player,

492
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,485
but that's not true.

493
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:31,610
He seems to be nice to everyone,

494
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:35,010
but he's only kind to the girl he likes in real life.

495
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:36,755
In other words, he's a real man.

496
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,295
You got a haircut.

497
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,865
You look cute.

498
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:21,865
How long will you follow me?

499
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:23,505
Why did you call me two days ago?

500
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,160
- I did? - Yes.

501
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,560
You left three missed calls.

502
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,605
You should've called if you wanted to know.

503
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,240
I forgot why I called you in the first place.

504
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,575
Is it that you have nothing to do or that you have a lot of time?

505
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:37,315
It's both.

506
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:42,325
Anyway, tell me why you followed me here.

507
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,625
- Because I wanted to see you. - What?

508
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,695
I followed you here because I wanted to see you.

509
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,325
Why did you want to see me?

510
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:51,895
Because I'm interested in you.

511
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:55,105
Tae Hee!

512
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:57,660
- Hello. - Hey.

513
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,260
You said you'd bring a friend. I did not know it'd be your boyfriend.

514
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:01,335
Sorry?

515
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:05,715
- No, he's not my boyfriend. - It's so nice to meet you.

516
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,710
This is Father Mateo. This is Ms. Park.

517
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,685
And I'm Columba.

518
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,855
I'm glad you're here.

519
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:16,850
So am I. I am really happy that you came.

520
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:18,725
Please join us.

521
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,895
My goodness.

522
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:28,965
Thank you for coming.

523
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:33,505
It's all right.
