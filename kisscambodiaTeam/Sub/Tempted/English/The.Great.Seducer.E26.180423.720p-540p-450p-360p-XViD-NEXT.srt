00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,478
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,914
It has become an empty nest now.

3
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:48,118
An empty nest.

4
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,955
- Don't open your eyes. No peeking. - Si Hyun, come here.

5
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,189
Take it slow.

6
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,392
- My gosh, what is this? - What?

7
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,560
- What was that? - Hey, quiet down.

8
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,462
Come forward.

9
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,299
- Hey, wait. - Okay.

10
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,201
- In 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

11
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,436
Look!

12
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:07,604
- What? - What's this?

13
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:10,073
Welcome to Se Joo's secondary palace.

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,375
I thought this used to be an art gallery.

15
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,910
- Yes. - It's like a club now.

16
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,146
There's a grand piano here.

17
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:20,517
I left school early for a month to decorate this place.

18
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:22,319
If you don't get kicked out from school, will this be yours?

19
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,353
Of course.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,156
It'll be so awesome to sit here on a snowy day.

21
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:27,924
Let's bring in the biggest game machine in here.

22
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,059
- Good? - Good.

23
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,227
Come around. Let's make rules.

24
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:33,129
We don't need any rules. Just use it.

25
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,398
No, you two have no self-control.

26
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:36,866
No one else is allowed in here.

27
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:37,901
- Okay. - Okay.

28
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,736
- Gather here when a war breaks out. - Okay.

29
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:41,237
Or in case of an earthquake.

30
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:42,238
- Okay. - Okay.

31
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,740
Hold your 60th birthday parties here.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,077
Okay. And you can't live here even when you get kicked out.

33
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:48,878
Why? It's perfect.

34
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,148
Soo Ji, to be honest,

35
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:55,885
my mom probably left me this place in case I get disowned.

36
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,953
Please be easy on me.

37
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:58,755
Don't get kicked out then.

38
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:02,025
Se Joo, you must defend this place, so contain your temper...

39
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,560
and stay home, okay?

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,795
- Okay. - I don't see any desks here.

41
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:07,931
No studying is allowed in here.

42
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,799
Exactly. What are you talking about?

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,702
I shouldn't stay here overnight during finals, right?

44
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,504
- In your dreams. - In your dreams.

45
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:40,029
(Voice Recordings)

46
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,231
This one.

47
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:46,369
Is her name Soo Ji?

48
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,105
You should teach her some manners.

49
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,107
I apologize.

50
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,777
That's not why I sent them away.

51
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:57,247
I wanted to give you an advice...

52
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,748
and a warning.

53
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:01,785
I can't let anyone who talks too much...

54
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,219
become a part of my family.

55
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,222
Unbelievable.

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,092
What did I do to make her say that I need to learn some manners?

57
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:12,228
And what's with Mom's submissive attitude?

58
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:16,699
She treated her like she's talkative for answering some questions for me.

59
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,803
My mom's the one who held that press conference for their sake.

60
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:22,038
What now? She talks too much?

61
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,661
- What? - Hey.

62
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,564
What should I do to make your grandma like me?

63
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:49,065
What do you mean?

64
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:52,302
We'll probably have a suffocating life in your house.

65
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,871
The least I can do is get on her good side.

66
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:57,407
Why does she like you so much?

67
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,309
Is it in your blood?

68
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,211
Soo Ji.

69
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:04,247
I'm not in the mood to discuss this with you.

70
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,349
I'm not asking because I want to either.

71
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,352
Do you know what she said to my mom...

72
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:11,087
after your grandma asked us to leave?

73
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,123
I recorded their conversation because I was curious,

74
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,392
and she wanted to teach me some manners first.

75
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,628
That's because she's a grandma.

76
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:20,830
You're...

77
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:24,033
her real grandson, so you're free to act like a baby.

78
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,668
But that's not my case.

79
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,971
So I changed my mind.

80
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:30,874
We failed to stop our parents from getting married...

81
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,476
by us faking or actually getting married.

82
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,512
And we're done being friends.

83
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,715
I need to find a way to survive and be treated like a person...

84
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:40,517
once I become a part of JK Group.

85
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:43,586
Don't put it like that. "Be treated like a person"?

86
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,689
Do you want to listen to what your grandma said?

87
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,992
Soo Ji, later.

88
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:52,161
My dad is sick, so I'm at the hospital.

89
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,099
Then you can listen to it when you have time.

90
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,376
(Soo Ji sent you a voice recording.)

91
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,093
Are you okay?

92
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,965
Sir, excuse me, sir.

93
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,333
- Are you okay? - I think he's unconscious.

94
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,501
Sir.

95
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:32,769
What's going on?

96
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,238
He suddenly fell unconscious.

97
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,273
He's unconscious.

98
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,242
- What happened? - He fell.

99
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:40,877
Sir.

100
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,879
Sir, please look at me.

101
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,514
Can you move?

102
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,482
Can you move your hands and head?

103
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:49,018
I think he hurt his leg too.

104
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:52,589
Don't worry about it, and wait here. A doctor will be here soon.

105
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,792
Can you move your hands and head?

106
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:59,095
I think you hurt your leg. You shouldn't move around.

107
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:01,531
I'm sorry, but can you wait for a second?

108
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:07,303
- Excuse me. - Coming through.

109
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:08,304
Please move.

110
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,075
Watch his head and legs.

111
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:13,076
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes.

112
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:16,079
Be careful.

113
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,247
- Put him on an IV immediately. - Yes.

114
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,316
- Coming through. - Excuse me.

115
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:26,756
My gosh.

116
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,835
Ms. Eun.

117
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:41,204
What brings you to the hospital?

118
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,309
We've met in Jeongeup, haven't we?

119
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,713
- What do you... - Why didn't you come back?

120
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,555
I don't understand what you're saying,

121
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,691
but have a cup of tea, then leave.

122
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,596
When I held onto you just now,

123
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,698
why were you so surprised?

124
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,235
Really? Was I really?

125
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:15,004
I got into a car accident two years ago in winter.

126
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:17,140
It happened in Jeongeup.

127
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:19,308
It was a hit-and-run,

128
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:22,245
and I just recently found out who the assailant was.

129
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,119
I see.

130
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:32,755
That must've been tough.

131
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,259
But I'm starting to think that the person may not be...

132
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,127
the actual assailant.

133
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:41,164
Because I was...

134
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,366
trying to save someone...

135
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,468
when I got into that accident.

136
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,107
The person you have reached is...

137
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,573
(Myung Mi Ri)

138
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,495
Excuse me.

139
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,803
I think I got into an accident.

140
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,138
An accident?

141
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:04,180
You didn't. You're fine. Don't worry about it.

142
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,515
Okay.

143
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,018
Are you hurt?

144
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:13,856
Is there a hospital nearby?

145
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:16,259
Can you call someone?

146
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,929
Gosh, I don't have a phone on me.

147
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:24,500
Give me a minute. I'll call 911 and get someone to help.

148
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,380
One second.

149
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:44,187
Please hold on.

150
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:51,260
I got into an accident as I ran to get help.

151
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,163
I'm sure you know very well because you're a doctor.

152
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,132
That most car accident victims...

153
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:59,769
do not remember the car that hit them.

154
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,637
Not even its color or shape.

155
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:05,374
That's what people say. It's because of the shock.

156
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,412
I also had forgotten about the car that hit me.

157
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,081
But I recently saw a car...

158
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,016
and thought it seemed oddly similar.

159
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:17,753
I saw Soo Ji's car when she drove to school,

160
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,656
and it seemed strangely familiar.

161
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:22,291
Just like...

162
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,294
how your giving first aid to that man seemed familiar.

163
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,532
Why didn't you come back?

164
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:34,637
It's you who hit me.

165
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:36,739
You said you were in a rush...

166
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,709
and that you'd return very soon.

167
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:41,844
You said you'd come back.

168
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,147
You told me to wait just a little.

169
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,850
Do you know how scared I was?

170
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,285
It was cold,

171
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:50,820
and I was in pain.

172
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:55,291
It was dark, and there were no cars passing by.

173
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:59,228
I was worried I wouldn't be able to wake up if I closed my eyes.

174
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,797
I couldn't fall asleep in case you couldn't find me.

175
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:04,267
Do you know how I endured each moment?

176
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,602
I trusted you...

177
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,974
when you said you'd come back.

178
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,243
I was scared,

179
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:17,380
but you said you'd come back.

180
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,093
No.

181
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,729
You're mistaken.

182
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,934
- I wasn't there. - You should have come.

183
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,737
You should have come back at all cost.

184
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:43,940
Because of what happened,

185
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,443
I couldn't even walk for a while.

186
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:50,246
I had to be treated, so I couldn't even go to school.

187
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:57,787
I had no choice.

188
00:11:58,688 --> 00:11:59,755
I...

189
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,826
I was going to the same person.

190
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:09,231
She passed away, so I completely forgot.

191
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,535
When I went back later, you were gone.

192
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,536
No.

193
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,006
You're just making excuses.

194
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:20,376
Wait.

195
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:23,746
Was that person...

196
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:26,349
Si Hyun's mother?

197
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,655
You lied too then.

198
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,524
You said Si Hyun's mother hit me.

199
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,427
How could you do that?

200
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:41,998
Did you even imagine how guilty Si Hyun must've felt?

201
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:47,770
I was on my way to save her too.

202
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:52,341
She was hospitalized, but she ran away.

203
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:56,078
She had a bad heart, so she had to be monitored constantly.

204
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:59,148
She would have been in trouble if something had happened.

205
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,087
I said that to Si Hyun because...

206
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:09,158
I don't know if you would understand,

207
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:12,561
but I thought that was the best thing to tell him.

208
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,898
There was a reason I couldn't tell him...

209
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,535
why his mother went to Jeongeup.

210
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:22,071
We know about everything.

211
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,540
His mother...

212
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,243
died on her way to see my mom.

213
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:32,715
That's good then.

214
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:36,585
If it weren't for Young Won,

215
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,754
none of this would have happened.

216
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,222
No, President Myung.

217
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:43,092
Stop trying to defend yourself with this nonsense.

218
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:45,795
If I wasn't my mom's daughter,

219
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,431
would you have apologized to me?

220
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,300
So...

221
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,303
just admit to your faults.

222
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:59,075
We were both trying to save the same person,

223
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,676
and that happened.

224
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:06,148
What do you want from me? I can compensate you for it.

225
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,018
What would you like?

226
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,421
Just admit to your faults.

227
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:15,391
Think about it. Even if I...

228
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:18,861
go to the police now, I won't get punished too heavily.

229
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:19,995
I know.

230
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:23,566
You would be able to avoid the charges.

231
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,169
But if you apologize sincerely,

232
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,905
we might feel better.

233
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:35,044
Confess everything, and apologize sincerely.

234
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:39,448
Then Si Hyun will feel less guilty,

235
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:41,817
and I...

236
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:44,286
won't report you to the police.

237
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,383
(Yoon Joon Young)

238
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:15,417
Yes.

239
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm almost there.

240
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,923
But I don't see her car yet.

241
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,658
She won't pick up either.

242
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,827
Are you sure she went to Jeongeup?

243
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:28,063
I looked everywhere she could be, but I couldn't find her.

244
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,566
I'm sure. She came here.

245
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,037
Why did you even say that?

246
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:38,107
I didn't know she would actually go there.

247
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,745
What's wrong?

248
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:44,647
Hello?

249
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,148
What is it, Mi Ri?

250
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,453
It's nothing.

251
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:55,791
I'll call you once I find her.

252
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,656
Are you all right?

253
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:29,792
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

254
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,828
Hello? Hold on.

255
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,570
Can you move?

256
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,340
Can you move your hands and head?

257
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:45,608
Can you move?

258
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,576
Get up. Move slowly.

259
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,485
I think you hurt your leg.

260
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,554
You shouldn't move around.

261
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:01,357
Can you call the ambulance for me?

262
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,759
There's a patient over there.

263
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:05,060
A patient?

264
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,229
Yes.

265
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,698
There's a woman in a car.

266
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,469
I was on my way to get help.

267
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,174
It's her.

268
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,544
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:26,115
Can you wait for me a little bit?

270
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:27,716
I'll come back soon.

271
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:29,918
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,436
Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

273
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:51,307
Ms. Park.

274
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:11,827
Tae Hee?

275
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:25,240
What's wrong, Mom?

276
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:27,443
Soo Ji.

277
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:31,213
Soo Ji, I...

278
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,581
Why are you crying?

279
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:35,818
Is it because Mr. Kwon is ill? Is it serious?

280
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,224
It's Tae Hee.

281
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,561
Tae Hee just walked out, right?

282
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:56,538
Calm down, Mom.

283
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:58,841
It's okay.

284
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:00,809
It's okay.

285
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,799
Tae Hee.

286
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,609
Si Hyun.

287
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,080
I have something to tell you.

288
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:48,317
Can we meet...

289
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,052
where we saw each other...

290
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:51,920
earlier?

291
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:53,789
I'll be there.

292
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,427
Are you okay?

293
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:02,831
- She'll be fine. - Okay. Thank you.

294
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,654
(Choi Soo Ji)

295
00:21:28,724 --> 00:21:31,994
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave...

296
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:33,195
(Eun Tae Hee)

297
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:35,831
(Si Hyun)

298
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:43,138
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave...

299
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,926
I'm not sure...

300
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:07,162
how I should start this off.

301
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,065
I found out who the driver...

302
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,034
of the hit-and-run is.

303
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,004
It wasn't your mom.

304
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,207
What do you mean?

305
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:21,677
Then who?

306
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,012
President Myung.

307
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,889
She's going to tell you everything soon.

308
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:42,731
Are you okay?

309
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,000
Me?

310
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,902
Are you all right?

311
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:56,044
I sat here wondering if I should tell you or not...

312
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:57,913
that it was her.

313
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,650
She accidently hit me as she was hurrying over...

314
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,118
to help your mom.

315
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,187
Are you okay?

316
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:08,256
This can be more shocking for you than me.

317
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:09,992
I don't care about that right now.

318
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,494
All I'm concerned about is if you're all right.

319
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:17,399
Let's set everything straight.

320
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,768
Let's report her for this and make her apologize.

321
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,103
I'll help you.

322
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:22,537
No.

323
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:25,841
I don't want to dig deeper into this.

324
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,743
Then will you just let it slide?

325
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:31,179
This tormented you for such a long time.

326
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:38,353
After all,

327
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:41,590
my mom started all this.

328
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,293
It would've been much better...

329
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,329
if I found out more about this a little quicker.

330
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:48,864
I do feel bad about that.

331
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:50,799
Then I could've made you feel...

332
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,001
less burdened than now.

333
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:57,673
None of this is your fault.

334
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:00,175
I know...

335
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:02,277
that it isn't.

336
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:05,247
But I'm still upset...

337
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:07,649
about the times that we've suffered.

338
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:12,154
There's nothing we can do about what our parents got into.

339
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:15,424
We can only make changes...

340
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:19,594
about the things that'll happen to us in the future.

341
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:23,465
You know what?

342
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:28,336
Even if it was your mom who hit me,

343
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:30,305
I was okay with that.

344
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:33,241
I really began to be okay with it.

345
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:41,583
You know,

346
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,318
you suddenly...

347
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,520
seem all grown-up.

348
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:54,396
I can't believe you're telling me that.

349
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,231
Odd, isn't it?

350
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:30,332
Goodbye.

351
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,733
Bye.

352
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:36,705
Tae Hee.

353
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:40,942
Can you give me one second? I'll go see Dad, then drop you off.

354
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:45,080
- I can go by myself. - It's late.

355
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,617
Please let me do that tonight.

356
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:54,523
Then take your time. I'll wait.

357
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:56,358
Okay.

358
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:23,218
Tae Hee.

359
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:29,925
You met my mom just now, didn't you?

360
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:32,127
Yes.

361
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,029
What did you say to her to make her like that?

362
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,897
Hey.

363
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:37,999
Tell me what you said.

364
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:39,835
Do you really want to know?

365
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:42,704
You won't be able to treat me like this after you hear it.

366
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:45,440
Why do you always bully those around you?

367
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,510
- My mom is crying because of you. - Exactly.

368
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,378
If you're curious, don't do this to me.

369
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:51,913
Go ask her yourself.

370
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:53,315
Soo Ji.

371
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:55,250
My gosh.

372
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,252
Si Hyun.

373
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,623
Soo Ji.

374
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:04,226
Stop it already.

375
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:06,194
She's having a difficult time. You can talk to me.

376
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,131
Si Hyun...

377
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,868
What more business do you have with her?

378
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,305
Let's go.

379
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,808
Si Hyun.

380
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:26,781
Soo Ji.

381
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,117
Please leave me alone.

382
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:32,787
And nothing good will come out of our talking right now.

383
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,457
Just go. I'm warning you.

384
00:27:37,392 --> 00:27:39,461
And stop coming in between us.

385
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:44,766
You can't do this to me.

386
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:49,804
Let's go.

387
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:45,794
(Tempted)

388
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:47,195
Soo Ji...

389
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,164
can't take this.

390
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:50,665
What's wrong?

391
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:54,202
I wish I was gone from this world.

392
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,938
Let me ask you one last time.

393
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:58,840
Will you not go back to Soo Ji?

394
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,176
Are you and Soo Ji going to leave like this?

395
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,945
Was I the only one who wanted to hold us three together?

396
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,414
Recently, when I wake up in the morning,

397
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:09,918
the first thing that's on my mind is that you are right there...

398
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,720
not too far away from me.
