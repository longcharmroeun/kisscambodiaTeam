00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,211
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:20,423
We played you for fun.

3
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:23,526
Why...

4
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,296
Why did you do this to me?

5
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:29,266
That's the wrong question.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,302
We don't have a special reason when we pick out our toy.

7
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:34,137
You should ask why we chose...

8
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,440
the scholarship student, Eun Tae Hee.

9
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:42,612
It's because as it so happens, you're Ki Young's first love.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,116
- What? - Si Hyun started the bet first...

11
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,818
to make Soo Ji feel better.

12
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,688
To him, what kind of girl you were or who you were...

13
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,189
wasn't of any importance.

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,158
Si Hyun...

15
00:00:57,494 --> 00:00:59,062
had to remind himself...

16
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:01,364
of your name a few times to memorize it.

17
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,801
- What was her name again? - Eun Tae Hee.

18
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,137
Her name is written right here. Try to remember.

19
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:09,739
We found out places you frequently visited...

20
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,375
and withdrew your application for the dorm you were to move into.

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,079
We thought about putting an end to the bet at that time,

22
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,448
but Si Hyun wouldn't stop.

23
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:21,818
He lied and went to help you move in.

24
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:25,021
He even let you move in across his studio.

25
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:28,725
He did everything he could do to stop you from coming on the trip.

26
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,628
He chased after you when you left early the next morning.

27
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:34,931
I don't know what happened between the two of you.

28
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:37,200
But at some point,

29
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:39,736
he started seeing you in secret,

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,073
liking you, and missing you.

31
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,709
And he's protecting you too.

32
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:52,882
Are you doing this to me...

33
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:55,385
because Si Hyun started to like me?

34
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:59,489
I can't care less about whether he really likes you or not.

35
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:00,890
It doesn't even matter to me.

36
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:03,426
Do I have a reason to want to split you two up?

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,261
I don't have one.

38
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,798
Now, think about this question.

39
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,235
Instead of asking why Si Hyun went after you,

40
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:13,903
ask this question.

41
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:16,539
"Why is Se Joo telling me all this?"

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,875
Don't you want to know that now?

43
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:23,713
Enough.

44
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,950
I don't want to hear anything else you people have to say.

45
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,918
Soo Ji,

46
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,555
Si Hyun, and me.

47
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,992
It's because things ended between the three of us.

48
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:40,497
Si Hyun has left us because of you.

49
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:43,133
I'm sorry that you became our toy.

50
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,567
But...

51
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,837
you're the only way I can punish him.

52
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:49,572
There's nothing else I can do to him.

53
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,808
Each and every one of you are...

54
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:55,044
nothing but human garbage.

55
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:56,246
We know.

56
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,649
We're impossible, human garbage who don't care at all...

57
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,684
when we hurt others.

58
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:03,319
So what?

59
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,092
You enjoy your lavish lives,

60
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:11,694
then complain that your lives are the hardest on earth.

61
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:16,232
Even when people get hurt, they don't live like you.

62
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:21,337
Did you have a blast when you deceived...

63
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:25,008
and made fun of me, thinking it's some kind of a great revenge?

64
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:28,011
Did this make you feel like you're above Ki Young?

65
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:31,948
This is disappointing. I thought you'd be touched.

66
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,718
You said Si Hyun loved you...

67
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,454
and that you loved him too.

68
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:40,590
That's why our little nest got torn apart.

69
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,228
Shouldn't you be touched even after knowing everything...

70
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,397
to make sure you stay as the Great Tae Hee?

71
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,834
Someone so great that you can humiliate us...

72
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,502
like that.

73
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,838
What will you do now?

74
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:58,508
Since you accepted everything else, will you forgive him for this too?

75
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,810
Can you really like him...

76
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:03,613
even after knowing the truth?

77
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,127
Are you all right?

78
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,262
(Kwon Si Hyun)

79
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,463
Can you get up?

80
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:40,743
Hello?

81
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:44,247
Oh, isn't this Tae Hee's phone?

82
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:47,483
She doesn't seem so well.

83
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,454
Where is she?

84
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:26,756
Tae Hee.

85
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:29,926
Are you okay?

86
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,897
Why are you here?

87
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,602
You know...

88
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,205
why I'm here.

89
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:45,241
- Well... - I saw it.

90
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,177
Your little nest.

91
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,313
And...

92
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,950
I also saw how you played around with me.

93
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:55,952
I saw everything.

94
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:01,057
- Tae Hee. - Was this why...

95
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:04,694
you were dying to talk to me?

96
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:06,863
I can explain everything.

97
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:10,667
Explain? What will you start with?

98
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:14,570
How you did my background check?

99
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:17,974
Or that you asked Kyung Joo about me?

100
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,780
Or about your plan to show up on the day my dorm got cancelled,

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,349
pretending to help me out?

102
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,952
And did you come up with the plan to bring me out on that trip...

103
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:33,022
and to pick me up at the station?

104
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,529
How did you know who my mom was?

105
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,232
Since when and how much did you find out about me...

106
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,269
before you did this to me?

107
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,671
You three...

108
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,507
You three must have had...

109
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:54,243
a lot of fun.

110
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,014
Why aren't you saying anything?

111
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,718
Did you forget to come up with a plan...

112
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:03,519
in case you get caught?

113
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:08,357
I remember your asking if I won't regret my decision in the beginning.

114
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,194
That you're worried you might make a mistake.

115
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,097
You're really something.

116
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,033
You left room...

117
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,203
to run away since the beginning.

118
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:21,270
No.

119
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,207
Why did it have to be me?

120
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:26,342
What did I ever do to you?

121
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:29,812
Even after hearing...

122
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:33,182
that you and Soo Ji like each other,

123
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:35,585
I still trusted the way you showed your heart to me.

124
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,854
Even when you humiliated me...

125
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:39,856
in front of your friends because of your pride,

126
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,691
I held back like an idiot.

127
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,027
Because I thought we liked each other.

128
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:49,532
I thought we could undo those little misunderstandings.

129
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,235
I took you in, held back, and tried to understand you.

130
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:53,970
Even if it was difficult,

131
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:57,940
I did it because I loved you.

132
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,111
It was so natural to me.

133
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,249
Must I be punished like this...

134
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,220
just because I trusted you?

135
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,055
It's...

136
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:15,658
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:19,028
I know that I can't be forgiven no matter what I say.

138
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,132
But I was serious too.

139
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,267
Serious?

140
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:29,472
If you were even a bit serious about me,

141
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:32,642
you should've ended everything when I asked you to break up.

142
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:35,578
No matter how much fun it was to see...

143
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,079
the idiot I was for taking you back...

144
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,783
No matter how amusing it was to see the way I embraced you,

145
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,086
you should have stopped right there and then.

146
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:47,657
If you're someone who can do this to someone you like...

147
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,193
If that's the Si Hyun I knew,

148
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,129
then I've never liked you.

149
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,365
I've never called out your name,

150
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,835
and I've never even known you.

151
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,077
Tae Hee.

152
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:15,351
I came to like you so much.

153
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,953
That's why this happened.

154
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:19,455
I know I wasn't supposed to do that,

155
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,758
but I tried to...

156
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,394
extend this day by day, then ended up like this.

157
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:29,532
At one point, I came to like you so much...

158
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,367
that I forgot about how guilty I felt.

159
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:35,404
I was scared to see time passing by,

160
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:38,975
but I wanted to...

161
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:43,679
remain as the guy who liked you for just one more day.

162
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:47,083
Sure.

163
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:50,553
I'm sure it wasn't in your plan...

164
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,022
to actually come to like me.

165
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,825
What you three planned was...

166
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,860
to see me suffer...

167
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:00,596
after I get abandoned.

168
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,268
- Tae Hee, please. - What are you trying to get back?

169
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,870
I never knew you.

170
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,005
No.

171
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:11,974
I said I was not sure who you really were...

172
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:14,076
and that I'd like to find out.

173
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,713
This is the last time I regret having said that.

174
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,349
Don't you get it?

175
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,886
The idiot that you three wanted to humiliate...

176
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,255
will end up loathing you for a long time.

177
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:29,525
I want you to be in as much pain as my hatred.

178
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,129
I want you to suffer.

179
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,333
I hope you will never be all right.

180
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,335
If not,

181
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:42,305
I will end up despising myself for knowing you...

182
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,876
and hating myself for accepting you every time.

183
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,449
I don't want to ever see you again.

184
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,208
(Hye Jeong)

185
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,113
(Power Off)

186
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:30,146
Did you have to do this?

187
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,360
I said...

188
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,297
I'd tell her everything and beg.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,336
Did you have to take that one opportunity from me?

190
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:58,327
(Recent calls)

191
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:45,774
(Hye Jeong)

192
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,183
Go home.

193
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:57,152
Your mother will scold you a lot.

194
00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,421
No.

195
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:03,659
If I go back home now, nothing will ever change.

196
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,894
Get up. You'll catch a cold.

197
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:39,662
Tae Hee.

198
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,335
- Tae Hee. - Mom.

199
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,638
Gosh. Are you okay? Come inside.

200
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,501
Kwon Seok Woo, 46 years old, male.

201
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:56,271
He came in as an outpatient, requesting we check his tumour.

202
00:18:56,972 --> 00:19:00,175
The tumour showed up in both the CT and MRI.

203
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:02,578
We'll cut it out in a guided operation.

204
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,014
The tumour’s putting pressure on the optic nerves,

205
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,282
so we'll observe...

206
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:12,654
The operation will take all day.

207
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:14,690
Okay.

208
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,995
Let's not worry too much.

209
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,932
Our best doctors and I will do our best to...

210
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:27,369
My dad's a tough guy. He'll pull through.

211
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:31,774
Si Hyun.

212
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,344
I know I wronged you...

213
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,846
and that I must beg for years.

214
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,350
It'll be hard, I know,

215
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,086
but can't you let me focus on your dad for now?

216
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,823
Please.

217
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:49,591
Sure.

218
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,295
Please take good care of him for me.

219
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,959
Kwon Seok Woo's being prepped for surgery.

220
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,197
He must've named you as his guardian.

221
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:51,220
Tae Hee.

222
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,924
Try to sit up.

223
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:02,731
Are you okay?

224
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,635
Drink some water, then go back to sleep.

225
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:07,669
Take some medicine.

226
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,314
Dad's in Seoul.

227
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:23,952
- I heard. - When he leaves,

228
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,455
I'll go with him.

229
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,156
What about school?

230
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,059
The more I say, the worse you'll feel.

231
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,295
Shall I still explain?

232
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,267
Only bad things happened to me since I came back.

233
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:41,203
We fought every day.

234
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,839
I was in an accident.

235
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,407
I suffered and recovered.

236
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:46,942
And then,

237
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:49,811
I thought things were only going to get better.

238
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,117
I thought if I moved to Seoul and lived alone,

239
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,819
everything was going to be fine.

240
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:01,323
I got into the college I wanted to attend.

241
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,126
I thought my life was going to get better.

242
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:07,729
But now, I just want to get away from all this.

243
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:26,615
It's not like you to oversleep.

244
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,853
Did you have breakfast?

245
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:36,191
You're concerned about me. That feels great.

246
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:41,897
Are you taking...

247
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:43,765
those pills again?

248
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,902
It's just because I can't seem to fall asleep.

249
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:49,705
Where were you this early?

250
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,108
Se Joo.

251
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,243
What is it?

252
00:22:58,614 --> 00:22:59,815
Did you get hit?

253
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:03,585
I met Si Hyun.

254
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:05,454
I...

255
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:08,256
told everything to Tae Hee.

256
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,092
Tell her what?

257
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:12,861
Everything.

258
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,130
I ended it.

259
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:16,965
Does Si Hyun know?

260
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,234
Probably.

261
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:21,737
Se Joo.

262
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:25,874
I'll tell him that I told you to do this.

263
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:27,943
What do you mean?

264
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,245
- Why would you say that? - Just listen to me.

265
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:34,750
Si Hyun and I can't go back to how it used to be anyway.

266
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:37,119
If Mr. Kwon and my mom get married,

267
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:40,622
we'd become family even if he hates me.

268
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:45,193
But I can't stand to watch...

269
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:48,864
your friendship fall apart.

270
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:52,034
Okay?

271
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:58,874
It's Hye Jeong.

272
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:02,010
Yes, Hye Jeong.

273
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:12,087
My gosh, what a nice place.

274
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:15,524
- We can play games here too. - I know.

275
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:25,634
Make yourselves at home. No one will come here.

276
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:28,303
Go back home as soon as possible if you can.

277
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:31,973
Don't you think your mother will find you no matter what?

278
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,309
Anyway, thank you, Se Joo.

279
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:37,612
Thanks to you, she will be safe even if it's for a day.

280
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:41,149
I'm sorry for making you worry.

281
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,217
Don't be.

282
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:46,455
Thank Soo Ji. I'm leaving now.

283
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,860
Thank you, Se Joo. We'll clean up the place.

284
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,228
We'll do that.

285
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,832
- Should we clean up? - Yes, let's do that.

286
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,468
Where are you, Hye Jeong?

287
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,672
- You have a guest, ma'am. - Goodness.

288
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:08,844
Ms. Jo.

289
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:11,780
You won't be able to attend the meeting with my family, right?

290
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,448
It's because of Hye Jeong.

291
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:19,755
What should we do?

292
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:22,491
I'm in a pickle too.

293
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,460
I don't know what to tell them.

294
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,630
I can't say Hye Jeong ran away from home.

295
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,699
However,

296
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,168
families are supposed to help each other out...

297
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,604
even though they may fight from time to time.

298
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:39,107
We'll be family soon.

299
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,443
Should I help you out?

300
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:45,046
Could you do that for me?

301
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,084
All right...

302
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,521
Hello, Secretary Kim.

303
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:55,924
Today's family meeting is canceled.

304
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,896
Tell my father that...

305
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,964
Ms. Jo is very sick.

306
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:07,402
Tell him that I'm personally taking her to the hospital.

307
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:11,473
It's done.

308
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:14,209
It won't take long to locate Hye Jeong.

309
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,811
Korea is a small country.

310
00:26:23,618 --> 00:26:27,389
(Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol)

311
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,625
Hello, Assemblyman Kim.

312
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:33,595
I heard that the clinical trials are being evaluated now.

313
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:34,696
Thank you.

314
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,265
When does your VIP center close?

315
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,601
It closes at 7pm.

316
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:43,238
My gosh, the center closes quite early.

317
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:46,875
Well, you know the promise you made the other day.

318
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:50,545
Some of my VIPs will be there by 8pm.

319
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,080
Please take good care of them.

320
00:26:56,051 --> 00:26:57,586
Okay, I understand.

321
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,535
Hi.

322
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:17,572
Mr. Kwon is in surgery now. It's going well.

323
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:19,941
Okay.

324
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:22,510
Si Hyun is in his ward now.

325
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:25,947
Okay.

326
00:28:10,225 --> 00:28:11,826
What's wrong with you?

327
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,234
Mr. Kwon is still in surgery.

328
00:28:20,235 --> 00:28:22,570
My mom said that it will take the entire day.

329
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,009
Why did you do that? You should've kept it on.

330
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:35,650
About the other day in the parking lot...

331
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:41,356
- I'm sorry. - Why would you be sorry?

332
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,260
At least, I deserved that.

333
00:28:49,197 --> 00:28:52,067
You should've just run me over.

334
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:54,769
If you did, she wouldn't have...

335
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,604
known anything, and I would've thanked you.

336
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:58,273
Si Hyun.

337
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,610
I asked Se Joo...

338
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,613
to tell everything to Tae Hee.

339
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:11,686
You know that Se Joo will do anything I ask.

340
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:15,657
I asked him to tell her that because I wanted to hurt her.

341
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:20,428
So don't resent Se Joo.

342
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:22,197
Soo Ji.

343
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:26,001
Think about everything we have done all these years.

344
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:30,105
We are such monsters, aren't we?

345
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:33,908
No.

346
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,846
I'm in no position to judge you two.

347
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,048
I didn't do anything right either.

348
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:45,053
How did we get here?

349
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,662
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,898
But...

351
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:59,934
let's not ever see each other again.

352
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:05,073
Even if we meet by coincidence,

353
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:08,043
let's pretend we don't know each other.
