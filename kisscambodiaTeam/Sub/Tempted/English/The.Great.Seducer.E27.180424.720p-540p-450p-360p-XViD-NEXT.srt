1
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:07,811
Let's go.

00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:10,080
(Episode 27)

3
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,330
She's probably more shocked than we are.

4
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:03,333
Let's go.

5
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,110
Are you okay?

6
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,415
One second.

7
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,318
- Can you stop the car? - Okay.

8
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:56,479
I'm cleaning out our hideout. Can you come? Let's do it together.

9
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,618
There are so many things I can't decide on by myself.

10
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:04,387
Soo Ji?

11
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:07,223
Hello?

12
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,261
What's wrong? Are you crying?

13
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:12,562
Se Joo.

14
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:14,297
I really...

15
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,834
I really...

16
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,805
think it's all over.

17
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,673
I'm coming. Stay right there.

18
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:47,530
When did everything go wrong?

19
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,400
I want to blame someone, but I have no one to blame.

20
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:53,169
I want to tell Mom that it's all her fault,

21
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,371
but it just breaks my heart even more.

22
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:58,641
How could Soo Ji and her mom do that to you?

23
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,443
How could they do that?

24
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,078
Exactly.

25
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:06,049
All I asked for was for her to apologize to Si Hyun.

26
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,453
How could Soo Ji do that to me?

27
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:12,388
Should I just tell her everything?

28
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,191
That Si Hyun was hurt because of her?

29
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,160
Yes, go tell her everything.

30
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,762
Tell her everything, and let her get hurt too.

31
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,969
No, that won't resolve anything.

32
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:29,506
- And that's not like me. - But you're hurt.

33
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:33,009
Why didn't you just lean on Si Hyun and cry your heart out?

34
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,114
If Si Hyun never met me,

35
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:41,184
he wouldn't have found out anything.

36
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:46,222
Forget it. You need to focus on yourself.

37
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,657
Kyung Joo.

38
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,528
What am I going to do?

39
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,132
It'll all come to pass.

40
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,801
It'll all get better.

41
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,504
When?

42
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,108
When will this all get better?

43
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,744
If I knew when I'd begin to feel better,

44
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:11,214
it would help me sit through this time,

45
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:14,717
but it's driving me crazy because I have no idea.

46
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:31,801
Soo Ji. Open the door. Soo Ji.

47
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,143
What's wrong?

48
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,453
Let's go home.

49
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,722
Or do you want to go to the hospital?

50
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:56,359
I don't want to do anything.

51
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:59,262
I don't want to see my mom,

52
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:02,265
I don't want to go home,

53
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,001
and I don't want to see anyone.

54
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:13,242
I wish I was gone from this world.

55
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,751
Can you turn off the light?

56
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,662
You were right.

57
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,566
Si Hyun is gone.

58
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,902
We can never go back to how we used to be.

59
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,512
- Se Joo. - Yes.

60
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,648
Se Joo.

61
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:57,320
- Yes? - You will...

62
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:01,858
leave me too, right?

63
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:04,594
No.

64
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:08,131
I'm never going to leave you.

65
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,723
Soo Ji. You can't sleep?

66
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:37,360
Do you think we won't be lonely...

67
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,028
even if it was just the two of us?

68
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,087
We were lonely at times...

69
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:06,556
even when there were the three of us.

70
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,509
I'll at least...

71
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:31,013
make you feel less lonely than...

72
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,116
when the three of us were together.

73
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,520
I'll stay by your side, Soo Ji.

74
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,161
Thank you.

Gosh, nothing is easy.

79
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:07,950
Is her name Soo Ji?

80
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:11,487
You should teach her some manners.

81
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:13,890
I apologize.

82
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:17,360
I can't let anyone who talks too much...

83
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,961
become a part of my family.

84
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,364
What do you mean?

85
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:23,432
I don't know about anyone else,

86
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:27,703
but I know exactly what you said to Si Hyun's mom...

87
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:31,407
on the day she passed away.

88
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,544
I'm sure you didn't think things would turn out like that.

89
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,646
But things said out of greed...

90
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:39,048
will bring about a disaster.

91
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:40,316
Your mom was...

92
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,985
on her way to see this person.

93
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:44,887
She got into the accident on her way there.

(President Myung Mi Ri)

95
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,934
President Myung, this is Si Hyun.

96
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,002
May I see you at the hospital?

97
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:03,472
I was thinking about taking the day off.

98
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:08,744
Is this urgent? Is this about your dad?

99
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,413
Then I'll go to your house.

100
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,484
Do you not feel well?

101
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,988
No, I just wanted to take a break.

102
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:23,826
Soo Ji must be at school.

103
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:26,262
Yes.

104
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:29,265
Why did you want to...

105
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,034
see me in private?

106
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,107
Let me ask you directly.

107
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,077
Why did you lie to me?

108
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:43,212
You said...

109
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,350
my mom was the hit-and-run suspect.

110
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,087
Si Hyun, that's...

111
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,890
You told my mom to go to Jeongeup too.

112
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,095
I guessed right.

113
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:03,866
You told my mom about Jeongeup.

114
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:11,173
I thought you were a good person.

115
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:14,510
I didn't want you to marry him, but I was going to accept it.

116
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,479
But I don't think I can do that now.

117
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,282
You knew about my mom's condition the most,

118
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,417
but you still told her about Jeongeup.

119
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:24,487
That means you had an ulterior motive.

120
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:28,891
- Si Hyun. - Why did you do that?

121
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,595
Did you want my parents to get divorced?

122
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,466
Si Hyun, I...

123
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:42,405
I overheard that Vice Chairman Kwon was going to Jeongeup,

124
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,777
and I told Ms. Park about it because I knew it concerned her.

125
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:53,316
I know I was being unnecessarily nosy.

126
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,085
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:02,658
But it was her choice to go there.

128
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,061
I was also worried about her,

129
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,996
so I stopped what I was doing and followed her.

130
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:08,030
And...

131
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,234
you hit Tae Hee.

132
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:17,907
If you have a sense of conscience, you should stop here.

133
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,576
I won't tell my father or Soo Ji.

134
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:22,778
Soo Ji...

135
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:25,982
won't be able to handle it.

136
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,608
My mom is crying because of you.

137
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,810
You won't be able to treat me like this after you hear it.

138
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,596
Mom.

139
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,834
You can't go to work?

140
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,303
Are you still not feeling okay?

141
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,572
I'll going to take the day off.

142
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,943
Did you not come home last night?

143
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:02,611
Where were you?

144
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:08,451
I went to the hospital and went straight to orchestra practice.

145
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,687
I'm going to take a nap and go back to school.

146
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,624
You should rest too.

147
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,312
I never questioned you,

148
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,215
but I wanted you to see it for yourself.

149
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:40,316
(Kwon Seok Woo and Kwon Si Hyun's DNAs match.)

150
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:41,984
You don't resent me, right?

151
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,998
Why would your father do that?

152
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,168
Where did he hear that from?

153
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:02,071
Goodness.

154
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:10,713
I think my mom told him.

155
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,683
She probably wanted to hurt him.

156
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,654
I'll tell him.

157
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,691
I think we need to figure this out.

158
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:28,797
Si Hyun.

159
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,100
Come to the States with me.

160
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,206
Okay, I will.

161
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:41,310
Before that, let me take care of a few things.

162
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:45,347
I want to find out what I want to do first.

163
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:47,316
Inheriting the company...

164
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,952
doesn't suit me.

165
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,520
I'm not confident that I can do it either.

166
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,356
Business is for people who are good at it.

167
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,159
Like my father or my sister.

168
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:58,861
Okay.

169
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,864
You don't need to feel rushed.

170
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:18,714
Mom.

171
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,318
What should I start with?

172
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,192
Tae Hee?

173
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:52,081
Tae Hee.

174
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:53,949
Hello.

175
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,836
I focused on the structure that looks the same from the past...

176
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:17,906
but has a completely different theme in the present.

177
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:20,609
In 1939, Gudun Station was...

178
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,912
a strategic location that connected Yangpyeong and Wonju.

179
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,547
As a double track was built...

180
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:28,817
going to Wonju, it went out of operation.

181
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,622
Let's have a look at Gudun Station today.

182
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,524
(Gudun Station 1, Gudun Station 2)

183
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:38,427
Compared to other old stations that turned into...

184
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,162
theme parks or rail bike courses,

185
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,764
it still looks the same as before.

186
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:44,700
Over 30,000 people visit every year...

187
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,838
And it's a popular site.

188
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,808
It has also been registered as the modern, architectural heritage.

189
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:55,511
The wooden ceiling of the waiting room...

190
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:59,615
is a sturdy structure that has endured for 77 years.

191
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:02,651
It has great architectural significance.

192
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,720
1, 2, 3.

193
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,355
1, 2.

194
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,224
1, 2.

195
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,994
Oh, gosh.

196
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:13,696
You're trying so hard to look good.

197
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,764
- Stop trying to look cool. - That hurts.

198
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:19,001
That's all I have. Thank you.

199
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:33,949
If you have no more questions, I'll finish here.

200
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:38,087
- Thank you. - Thank you.

201
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,958
Come back home.

202
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,528
See you later. Let's have lunch.

203
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:50,432
Tae Hee.

204
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,267
Have a good lunch.

205
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,970
You too.

206
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,919
Your school's cafeteria food is so good.

207
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:14,556
Isn't home-cooked food still better?

208
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,359
For example, my pasta or eggs.

209
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,894
Or just instant noodles.

210
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:25,434
Is your father doing okay?

211
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,771
Yes, his surgery was scheduled.

212
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:32,007
I really hope he gets better soon.

213
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:36,078
But that's all I have to say.

214
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,213
You can continue eating.

215
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:14,783
It's cold, right?

216
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,553
It's a warm jacket from home.

217
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:21,089
This school is great.

218
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,058
You just have to show them your ID to get in.

219
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:53,856
Why do you keep doing this?

220
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:55,257
What do you mean?

221
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:27,322
How long will you follow me around?

222
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,024
Why are you following me?

223
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,462
How long will you follow me?

224
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,333
Anyway, tell me why you followed me here.

225
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,038
It's just like that time.

226
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,606
Just tell me why you're doing this.

227
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:46,542
You know very well that we can't forget...

228
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,011
about what happened and go back to how it used to be.

229
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,346
If you keep this up, you're only making it hard for me.

230
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,182
I'm not trying to go back to how it used to be.

231
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:55,651
Then what is this about?

232
00:21:57,853 --> 00:21:58,921
Tae Hee.

233
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,523
Go home.

234
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:09,898
That's none of your concern. Why do you care?

235
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:11,133
You're not going home...

236
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:14,002
and staying at some other place because of me.

237
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,208
Go home for your own sake.

238
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,811
Then I won't bother you anymore.

239
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:45,100
Schools will differ depending on what you're interested in majoring.

240
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:48,870
If you want to concentrate on drawing, apply for an art school.

241
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,273
If you're interested in other areas like design,

242
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,208
it's better to apply for a general university.

243
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,211
I haven't come up with big plans like that yet.

244
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,246
When are you thinking of applying?

245
00:22:58,547 --> 00:22:59,815
As soon as I can.

246
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,619
What's with the sudden change of heart?

247
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:09,024
I need to go to an unfamiliar place for me to forget things...

248
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,927
and have new ideas. That's what I thought.

249
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:14,730
Okay.

250
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:17,432
Tell me if you need anything.

251
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,501
Thank you.

252
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:23,438
I always appreciated your help.

253
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,875
You're chatty today.

254
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:31,747
Here. These are the practice books and memos I used when I started.

255
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:34,116
- These will be helpful. - My gosh.

256
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,185
Soo Ji, why are you giving me these?

257
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:38,720
Are you going somewhere?

258
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,455
Just because.

259
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:43,025
If you become interested in cello, I thought they might be of help.

260
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:47,095
Thank you. I will do my best.

261
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:50,132
The drinks are on me. I have a lot of coupons.

262
00:23:50,132 --> 00:23:51,967
Okay. Thank you.

263
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,870
Your boyfriend is so nice.

264
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,139
It's all thanks to you and your friends.

265
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:00,842
Are you not hanging out with Se Joo and Si Hyun today?

266
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,279
I should.

267
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:07,149
I should but...

268
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:12,287
Where do you usually hang out with them?

269
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:14,189
You guys hang out so often.

270
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:18,193
We don't have a place to go. We always go to a park or a cafe.

271
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:21,630
We had a hideout only we could get into.

272
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:25,734
It was more comfortable and warmer than home.

273
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:27,269
That sounds so cool.

274
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,838
Can you invite us there some other time?

275
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:31,707
I will keep it a secret.

276
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:34,643
I'll see what I can do.

277
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,181
What are you two doing here?

278
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,652
What brings you here?

279
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,621
My law firm is nearby.

280
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:49,191
Is it just the two of you?

281
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,464
- Joo An, let me help. - Okay.

282
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:58,033
Hello.

283
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:01,069
You're the part-timer at the bar.

284
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,237
Hey, Choi Soo Ji.

285
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:05,674
Go on a date without Hye Jeong. She's innocent unlike you.

286
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:07,509
Don't interfere in my business, and just leave.

287
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:10,512
I'm only saying this because it's too sad to see you...

288
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,247
date a nobody and throw your life away.

289
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:14,816
"A nobody"?

290
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,752
She's throwing her life away?

291
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,087
Hye Jeong, come with me.

292
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,889
It's not a suitable place for you to be in.

293
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:21,857
Let go.

294
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:25,994
What's wrong with my Joo An?

295
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:28,230
You know nothing about fashion, and you're as ugly as a pig.

296
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,298
How dare you judge him?

297
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,667
You threw your manners out the window all right.

298
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:35,437
There's a limit to your nonsense I can put up with.

299
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:38,373
Look at your shoes. The color couldn't be any gloomier.

300
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:41,877
Joo An, let's go.

301
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:44,713
There's no reason for us to listen to his gibberish.

302
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:46,915
- Let's go, Soo Ji. - Oh, my.

303
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:51,319
Hye Jeong.

304
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,089
You're seeing another man?

305
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:58,093
My gosh, the color of his shoes was so dull.

306
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,195
He won't tell on your mother, will he?

307
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:02,597
It already happened. There's nothing I can do now.

308
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:05,100
If she finds out, I won't back down.

309
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,035
Don't provoke Ki Young.

310
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:09,271
He can't stand losing face.

311
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,640
She's right. He is one nasty man.

312
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,843
I saw him get into a fight at the bar I worked at.

313
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:17,679
Hye Jeong, go home now.

314
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,782
If Ki Young brings this up, say that Joo An is my boyfriend.

315
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,118
- The same goes for you too. - Okay.

316
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:25,754
Soo Ji, thank you so much.

317
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,056
Go on, now.

318
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:30,959
- Bye. - Goodbye.

319
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:38,600
Doors are closing.

320
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:54,783
(Dad)

321
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:58,153
- Hey, Dad. - Where are you?

322
00:26:58,153 --> 00:26:59,187
Me?

323
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:02,824
I'm... I'm on my way home.

324
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:06,261
I see. I'll board the plane soon. I'll go to your school tomorrow.

325
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:08,330
You will be tired. You don't need to come.

326
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,332
I heard you are busy these days.

327
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:13,068
Hurry home. You must be tired.

328
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,804
Okay. I'm almost home anyway.

329
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:17,639
I'll rest up.

330
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,123
Thank you for coming back, Tae Hee.

331
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,199
- Your return is good enough for me. - I'm home.

332
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:47,469
What a relief.
