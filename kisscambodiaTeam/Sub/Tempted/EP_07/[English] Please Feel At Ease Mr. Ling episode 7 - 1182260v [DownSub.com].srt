[Episode 7]

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,980
Thanks.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,730
Brother?

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,570
Given his way of avoiding a problem by walking away from it, if I were her, I would find a new lover too.

25
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,370
With which eye did you see that he was good-looking?

26
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,980
He's very radiant. Girls like his type.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,730
Your mother is always wishing to the moon and the stars for you to return.

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,750
But the first thing you do upon returning wasn't to see her. Do you think I don't know?

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,280
Anxin doesn't count as an outsider.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,350
Look at her shameful behavior.

31
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,900
She is made of the same mold as her mother.

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,700
Whatever bad thing she does, I wouldn't be surprised.

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,520
That's enough, stop fighting. Our son just came back.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,130
However you look at it, Anxin is a child of our Gu family.

35
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,140
You also promised Sister Jin Guan that you would take good care of her.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,510
This child was indeed too headstrong in the past.

37
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,840
But I trust that she now knows she was wrong.

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,570
Oh right, Yuanchao. It's your birthday in a few days.

39
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,020
How about we welcome her over to get together?

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,590
You can organize it.

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,120
Leave it to me.

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,730

Hello, Aunt Hong.

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,940
Anxin, have you eaten?

47
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,870
Yes.

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,770
So, tomorrow is your dad's birthday.

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,240
We're celebrating at the Howard Johnson hotel.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,180
Look, you are after all a child of the Gu family.

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,720
It's not right for you to stay adrift for so long.

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,830
How about you take this opportunity to come back?

53
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,470
Aunt Hong.

54
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,390
Ever since he drove me out of the country,

55
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,390
I stopped being a part of the Gu family.

56
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,850
Are you blaming me for not taking good care of you?

57
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,440
No. Aunt Hong, you've been very good to me.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,440
- It's just... 
 - Anxin, your mom was my good friend.

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,170
I am partly responsible for your current state.

60
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,710
It's normal for you to blame me.

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,560
It's just... your dad's health isn't as good as before.

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,510
He wishes for you to come see him more often.

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,170
What's more, Ansheng has come back too.

64
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,150
You two have such a good relationship. You must want to see each other.

65
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,820
Then it's settled.

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,100
I'll have Ansheng come pick you up tomorrow. Sleep early tonight.

67
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,170
You sleep early too.

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,480
Brother!

69
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,180
Isn't there still a lot of time until the banquet? How come you're here to pick me up so early?

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,390
I'll take you to buy some clothes first.

71
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,170
Buy clothes?

72
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,290
Isn't what I'm wearing fine?

73
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,950
It's fine, but it can be better.

74
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,560

77
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,840
- Hi Uncle Jiang. 
 - Xin'er?

78
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,800
I haven't seen you in so long. You've grown up to be so beautiful.

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,350
Whose eye fell into this?

80
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,770
Am I right, you little brat?

81
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,860
Stop staring.

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,440
That's the eldest son of the Gu family, right? Who's that girl by his side?

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,470
I don't know. She's quite pretty, isn't she?

84
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,840
Do you feel like this girl

85
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,570
and Chairman Gu's predecessor, Mrs. Jin,

86
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,050
look somewhat similar?

87
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,680
They are really quite similar!

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,790
Could she be the daughter Mrs. Jin

89
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,050
had with someone out of wedlock?

90
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,060
What "someone"? Isn't it the chairman of Ling Group?

91
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060

95
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,590
With how loud they're talking, I bet they're afraid others will hear them.

It's good that you've come. No need to make yourself ill at ease.

105
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,490
That's right, Anxin. We're all family. No need to be so formal.

106
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,800
So that person is the five percent?

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,890
If only Dad were here.

108
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,660
Why would he come here?

109
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,690
Come to someone else's territory to recognize his daughter? That's crazy.

110
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,460
I've looked for her for so long. In the end, finding her didn't take any work at all.

Is this Gu Ansheng a stamp collecting machine? What does he need so many awards for?

115
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,230
His gaze is gentle and soft, and his eyes are resolute.

There aren't many who are good-looking, approachable, and a top student.

Girls all like this kind of man.

When did you learn to judge people by their faces?

119
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,530
This is called having a sharp eye for people. If you don't believe me, ask Ai Li.

120

President Ling is of course the most perfect.

You are her boss. Of course she doesn't dare say the truth.

You are...

141
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,130
What's interesting about magic is that it's full of secrets.

Why does his manner of speech give me the impression of multi-level marketing? Is he a swindler?

147

All of a sudden, I don't want to know.

148

My younger brother is not a good person.

173

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,610
I know you have a lot of doubts. I will explain everything to you.

176
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,730
But right now, can you stay away from my older brother?

177
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,090
I understand. You want me to stay away from your Ling family.

178
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,390
That's not true, Anxin. That's not what I mean.

179
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,900
Jerk.

180
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,120
Brother Yue, how do you know my sister?

181
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,560
It's a long story.

182
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,170
If my younger brother purposely tries to get close to you, then you better watch out.

183
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,070
After all, you have five percent of our Ling family stock.

184
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,470
What five percent?

185
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,230
Aren't you curious about the world behind the secrets? Once you meet my dad, you'll understand.

186
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,600
Your dad?

187
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,750
The President of Ling Group, Ling Tian.

188
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,660
He's also an old friend of your mom, Jin Wan.

189
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,870
Your dad doesn't have the slightest relationship with my mom.

190
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,360
As for this five percent of stock, I don't know anything.

191
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,570
Don't make irresponsible remarks.

192
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,730
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,190
Gu Anxin, do you still remember me?

194
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,130
- Anxin! 
 - Anxin, are you okay?

195
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,380
- Anxin. 
 - Are you okay?

196
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,050
- Hurry and call the police! 
 - Don't call the police.

197
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,560
- This is my friend. 
 - Who is your friend?

198
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,840
I must have gotten eight generations of bad luck to have met you.

199
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,520
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have fallen into such a state.

200
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,550
What are you doing?

201
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,280
Anxin, how much of a mess do you want to make?

202
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,260
Dad!

203
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,410
Chairman Gu, shouldn't you be protecting your daughter at a time like this?

204
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,120
Ling Yue, this is my family matter.

205
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,390
I hope you can stay out of my business.

206
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,910
But I can't stay out of things concerning Anxin.

207
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,930
Chairman, we've disturbed everyone's banquet.

208
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,390
We'll leave right now.

209
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,370
Yu Guo,

210
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,810
I looked for you for so long and never found you.

211
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,070
Let's find a quiet place, and I'll explain everything to you, okay?

212
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,020
Let her go.

213
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,360
- Anxin. 
 - I'll go with you.

214
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,760
This is my private matter. You don't need to follow.

215
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,820
If you keep following me, I won't speak to you again.

216
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,020
Alright, everyone can stop looking. It's a small incident.

217
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,450
Confiscate all the cameras. Delete all the pictures.

218
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,530
Yu Guo, I'm sorry.

219
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,450
I never thought our first encounter would be like this.

220
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,830
I didn't only lose my hands. I lost my whole life.

221
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,310
Can your one word of "sorry" fix things?

222
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,200
Yu Guo,

223
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,830
I know there's nothing I can do to make things up to you.

224
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,290
But I will do everything I can to make things up...

225
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,320
That's right. You're now a rich girl at the top of society.

226
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,880
What can't you do? What can't you make up?

227
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,500
Stop!

228
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,960
Zoom in.

229
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,110
After that, they disappeared.

230
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,380
- I'll do anything you ask of me. 
 - Alright.

231
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,620
Right now I want your hand. You can use this hand to make things up to me.

232
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,300
What part of the hotel doesn't have monitoring?

233
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,040
The locker rooms and bathrooms don't have any.

234
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,050
Let's hurry and search them one-by-one.

235
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,650
Anxin. Anxin.

236
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,830
Gu Anxin.

237
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,680
Move aside.

238
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,530
Anxin. Anxin!

239
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,490
Send her to the hospital.

240
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,500
When did he become so cunning?

241
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,660
Anxin.

242
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,390
Thank you, President Ling. You can hand my sister back to me.

243
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,250
No need.

244
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220
What did you say?

245
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,500
Even if your Anxin's friend,

246
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,590
to brazenly take my sister from my Gu family banquet

247
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,800
is not very appropriate.

248
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,330
She is mine.

249
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,630
What nonsense are you saying?

250
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,750
I said, she's mine.

251
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,810
Both of you, take it easy.

252
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,650
Mr. Gu, President Ling and Anxin's relationship

253
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,230
is closer than you think.

254
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,080
What can one picture prove?

255
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,820
Look at the mess you've made.

256
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,920
Let them leave.

257
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,820
And you.

258
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,480
For this trivial matter, you've left all those guests

259
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,850
to the side. 
 - Dad, how can this be a trivial matter?

260
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,450
- Anxin is already— 
 - Ansheng!

261
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,330
Come back with me.

262
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,780
Xin'er, goodbye.

263
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,610
Elder Brother, why are you holding your stomach?

264
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,450
It's nothing. I ate something bad.

265
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,720
Where is Second Brother?

266
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,140
Second Brother already left.

267
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,160
Let's go home.

268
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,430
Are you okay?

269
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,280
- Is your stomach okay? 
 - I'm fine.

270
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,630
[Go back to the countryside for a while now.]

271
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,670
[I will come find you.]

272
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,700
Gu Anxin, we will meet again.

273
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,150
Didn't you say she's fine?

274
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,480
- Why hasn't she woken yet?
- She hasn't woken up yet

275
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,520
not just because of her physical health.

276
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,940
But its because she has too much responsibility to handle at once

277
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,140
I don't have to say who this was caused by right?

278
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,370
Here

279
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,970
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

280
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,680
It's none of your business.

281
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,190
Where is Yu guo ?

282
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't worry, I won't let her get away with it.

283
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,170
If you dare do anything to her I won't let you get away with it.

284
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,310
You're too kind. He's already caused you to be like this and you're still protecting him.

285
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,090
Yes, I'm too kind.

286
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,430
If I hadn't been this kind when I first met you

287
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,590
I wouldn't have been lied to.

288
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,330
- It's my fault. 
 - It doesn't matter.

289
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,160
Let go.

290
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,380
You should go out first.

291
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,660
Me?

292
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,010
Close the door on your way out

293
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,260
Let's talk.

294
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,810
Talk about what?

295
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,740
Talk about how much the hospital fees are?

296
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,220
- That's not what I mean.
- Then there's nothing to talk about.

297
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,010
Let go.

298
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,190
If-if I let go and you leave, then what happens?

299
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,650
I won't leave, let me go.

300
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,190
Then we've agreed, you won't leave.

301
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,610
Agreed, I won't leave.

302
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,550
No, you must be lying.

303
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,120
If you don't let go of me, I'll bite off my tongue and commit suicide now

304
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,970
I'm going to bite

305
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,890
Don't be rash.

306
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,820
What century is this even ...

307
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,390
Can you give me one minute of your time

308
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,150
Go ahead.

309
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,030
I'm sorry. I've come back too late.

310
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,930
Since you left you don't have to come back.

311
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,020
I only left

312
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,110
because something urgent happened at home. I had to go back.

313
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,360
Do you have to go to the hotel for urgent matters?

314
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,040
Hotel?

315
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,580
- How did you —
- How did I know?

316
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,910
I already don't know too many things.

317
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,400
Amnesia?

318
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,150
Also lying about the leg injury?

319
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,470
No, you've been lying since the start.

320
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,410
Just for the 5% of stocks.

321
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,290
President Ling, you've worked hard at acting.

322
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,390
Ai le is just my assistant

323
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,790
It's my fault for not telling you somethings right away.

324
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,020
Though my leg healed and I didn't tell you, that was my fault.

325
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,900
But my feelings for you have been true all along.

326
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,850
[time's up]

327
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,990
- Dad.
- I don't care where you are right now,

328
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,250
you come back right away!

329
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,280
Anxin, wait for me for a moment.

330
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,150
I'll be back soon.

331
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,570
Okay.

332
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,370
Keep your word

333
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,010
Stamp this

334
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,520
Childish.

335
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,580
This is what you taught me

336
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,380
Why are you taking my shoes?

337
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,930
I'm keeping it, in case you leave.

338
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,090
Ling Yue, do you know a girl named Gu Anxin?

339
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,720
Yes.

340
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,330
- She's the one that I like.
- Someone you like?

341
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,450
So you're saying you knew all along where she was

342
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,580
but you hid it from me?

343
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,610
Is this for the 5% of stocks she has?

344
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,300
Brother, now that's wrong of you

345
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,800
How can you cheat Gu Anxin's feelings just for the 5%?

346
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,500
Also, what if

347
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,310
Anxin is really dad's daughter

348
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,840
then you made a huge mistake!

349
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,030
I truly like Anxin.

350
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,610
Also, she's not dad's daughter.

351
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,230
This is Anxin's DNA report.

352
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,900
It says she's not your daughter.

353
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,030
If Anxin isn't our family

354
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,530
then why did dad give her stocks?

355
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,710
You're right.

356
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,630
Anxin isn't my daughter.

357
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,110
Since everyone is gathered here today

358
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,880
I'll just tell everyone at once

359
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,590
I'll tell you everything.

360
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,690
The reason I gave her the stocks

361
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,910
is because of her mother, Jinwan.

362
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,530
To me, Ling Tian, Jinwan is

363
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,690
someone I am grateful to for the rest of my life.

364
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,880
I remember when I first started and failed

365
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,600
if it weren't for Jinwan's help

366
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,270
there's no way we could have today's Ling Group.

367
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,540
That's why, to me Jinwan

368
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,330
is my friend and also my savior.

369
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,550
The 5% of stocks

370
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,310
was my promise to give to Jinwan.

371
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,330
Even though she's not here anymore, my words

372
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,440
will not be taken back.

373
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,970
Although Anxin doesn't have blood-relations with me,

374
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,570
Jinwan's daughter is my daughter.

375
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,810
So you all remember this, do not

376
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,160
do anything towards Anxin.

377
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,290
Brother, didn't your leg just recover ?

378
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,110
Be careful when you walk

379
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,140
You don't have to worry about it, Big brother.

380
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,420
Have a safe trip.

381
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,900
Big brother, why are your words so harsh?

382
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,060
How was that harsh?

383
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,580
Big brother, didn't dad just say

384
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,640
we can't bother Anxin.

385
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,410
Are you thinking of doing something else ?

386
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,060
That is what is said

387
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,830
But is the daughter and daughter in law

388
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,710
But I still feel like, you are still not on par with Ling Yue

389
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,240
Wait, what did you say ?

390
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,650
My sister is in this ward room right?

391
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,150
No...ahh.

392

Don't make things difficult for me.

394
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,630
Anxin, you big brother is here to pick you up.

395
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,360
Anxin?

396
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,730
Anxin!

397
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,270
- Big brother! 
- Come up, quickly.

398
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,060
- Why are you here?
- Come back up quickly!

399
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,420
I can't get up.

400
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,950
- Can I go down instead, it's not that high up.
- Wait for me. I'm coming right away!

401
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,720
Hold on to the rope

402
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,050
You almost scared me to death, when did you recover

403
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,530
You go tell Ling Yue

404
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,720
Medical fees and anything I owe him I will return to him.

405
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,370
Big brother, let's go.

406
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,230
Let's go.

407
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,930
How about I give the medical fees?

408

Can you not leave?

409
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,940

410
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,450
Your call cannot be connected.

411
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,350
President Ling.

412
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,720
President Ling, you should knock.

413
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,830
Where is Anxin? Where did you hide her?

414
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,110
Isn't hiding people, your specialty?

415
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,610
Mr. Gu, we are looking for Miss Anxin to talk about something.

416
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,840
Then wait here a second, I will get her to come out.

417
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,170
What are you doing?

418
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,440
Guys can't just go into a girl's room.

419
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,210
I am Gu Anxin's brother, who are you?

420
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,420
I am her soulmate. I slept here several times.

I am also hungry, so let's go together.

-Fly? 
-That's right.

439
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,280
It's those restaurants with a lot of germs, dust, and flies that fly around.

440
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,820
Maybe when you are eating, there may be something that drops into your food.

Do you still want to go?

442

You can go eat, I don't want to eat.

I'm not going, please don't starve yourself.

447

I'd not see you out.

450

If you don't want to go out, then let's not go out. I'll make something at home.

I fought with my classmates

467
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,630
and even though I was the one who hit him,

468
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,300
you just had to rush to his house and drag him out, making him apologize to me.

469
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,660
Aunt Hong punished you to keep writing self-criticism for a whole week for this thing

470
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,580
You are the one to talk- who was the one, at that time,

00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,570
told me to just photocopy my self-criticisms instead of writing?

472

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,120
♫ Borrowing the hands of friendship to hug you ♫

526
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,510
♫ Obviously, I am starting to mind more and more ♫

527
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:04,710
♫ Abandoning the token of happiness, for it has always been you ♫

528
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:10,750
♫ Our story has only just begun ♫

529
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:16,750
♫ Yet the longing has never been able to stop ♫

530
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:23,260
♫ Searching for the route to return to your side ♫

531
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,230
♫ Our story has only just begun ♫

532
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:35,310
♫ Using all of my most beautiful adjectives ♫

533
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:41,650
♫ Is still not enough to describe your name ♫

534
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:47,620
♫ Our story is exclusively ours ♫

535
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:53,790
♫ Our palms hold onto the key to the future ♫

536
00:45:53,790 --> 00:46:01,930
♫ Using love to slowly open up a lifetime ♫
